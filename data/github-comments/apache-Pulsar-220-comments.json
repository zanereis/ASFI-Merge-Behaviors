Broker should not persist data because of non-durable cursor's existence but broker should allow non-durable cursor to read data which has been persisted due to durable-cursors or retention policy. \r\n2. Data should be persisted only if a durable-cursor is backlogged or retention policy is configured.\r\n3. If durable-cursor is not backlogged and retention duration is already passed then broker should delete the data in a such a way that non-durable cursor's offset should skip already deleted data and offset should be advanced to ledger which is not deleted yet.\r\n\r\nSo, I would agree that data should not be retained because of non-durable cursor and broker should not consider non-durable cursor's state while deleting the data.\r\n\r\n> The behavior of a non-durable cursor reading a managed ledger should be close to the behavior of a file reader reading a file in the filesystem. If a reader is actively reading a file, the file is still accessible even it is deleted. \r\n\r\nYes, that is correct. But I think file-reader is one of the usecase of non-durable readers and there should be a way to do it with non-durable cursors and for that, we can configure retention period to retain data for the expected duration. that also guarantees data availability for non-durable curosr in case of reconnection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/634895127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/634940827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6787#issuecomment-634940827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6787","id":634940827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNDk0MDgyNw==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-27T21:08:23Z","updated_at":"2020-05-27T21:08:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We can do here:\r\n> \r\n> a) use a feature flag to control whether include reader cursors in the storage quota consideration;

DD only has a single job to do on disk, so you can see that it is exceeding the baseline (bursting) without any tweaking. Pulsar is a bit more sophisticated so it will never look like DD performance.\r\n\r\nIn your graphs, bookie is also exceeding the baseline (bursting) often too (150MBs peak observed). Your workload storage utilization appears pretty consistent though, so it is also likely you are consuming burst as it becomes available quite quickly, therefore not sustaining those higher throughputs. These are promising indicators that you may benefit from an EC2 instance with a higher baseline.\r\n\r\nSide notes: Generally, no application will attain the performance that a benchmarking tool would, simply because apps have more things to do, and unit of data that apps operate with may not align to the peak testing scenarios. Database servers get close but i wouldn't expect pub sub messaging to. For this reason you should not over-focus on attaining these peaks, and throughput shouldn't be your only performance goal. Generally speaking, smaller IO sizes typically have lower(better) response time and but lower (worse) throughput, but inversely larger IO has higher (better) throughput but higher(worse) response time. Which is best for your actual production needs? Don't forget the application metrics: i.e. how many messages/sec do you actually need on your worse day and work backwards from there. \r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the pulsar documentation itself recommends i3 instance types which have their own NVMe disks - which will go well beyond EBS performance. https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/v2.0.1-incubating/deployment/aws-cluster/\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you find the best instance size/instance count/cost ratio for your needs. Keen to hear back your next findings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635066612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635075286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6052#issuecomment-635075286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6052","id":635075286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTA3NTI4Ng==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T03:30:04Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T03:30:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635075286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635076014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6996#issuecomment-635076014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6996","id":635076014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTA3NjAxNA==","user":{"login":"equanz","id":12148992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ4OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12148992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz","html_url":"https://github.com/equanz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/equanz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T03:32:38Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T03:32:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635076014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635081278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7058#issuecomment-635081278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7058","id":635081278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTA4MTI3OA==","user":{"login":"ckdarby","id":220283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDI4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby","html_url":"https://github.com/ckdarby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckdarby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T03:53:31Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T03:53:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ashwallace Thanks for everything.

effect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635754644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/635769276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7091#issuecomment-635769276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7091","id":635769276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTc2OTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"zhanghaou","id":5668441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Njg0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5668441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou","html_url":"https://github.com/zhanghaou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhanghaou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-29T05:33:58Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T05:33:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

Motivation\r\nwhen consumer send fetch request to broker server, it contains fetch message number telling the server how many messges should be pushed to consumer client. However, the broker server stores data in bookkeeper or broker cache according to entry not single message if producer produce message using batch feature. There is a gap to map the number of message to the number of entry when dealing with consumer fetch request.\r\n\r\nCurrent strategy just using the following calculating formula to deal with those situation:\r\n```\r\nmessagesToRead = Math.min(availablePermits, readBatchSize);\r\n```\r\n`availablePermits` is the number of message the consumer requested, and `readBatchSize` is the max read entry size set in broker.conf\r\n\r\nAssuming `availablePermits` is 1000 and `readBatchSize` is 500, and each entry contains 1000 messages, messagesToRead will be 500 according to this formula. The broker server will read 500 entry, that is `500 * 1000 = 500,000` messages from bookkeeper or broker cache and push `500,000` messages to consumer at one time though the consumer just need 1000 messages, which leading the consumer cost too much memory to store the fetched message, especially when we increase `readBatchSize` to increase bookkeeper read throughput.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nI add an variable `avgMessagesPerEntry` to record average messages stored in one entry. It will update when broker server push message to the consumer using the following calculating formula\r\n```\r\navgMessagesPerEntry = avgMessagePerEntry * avgPercent + (1 - avgPercent) * new Value\r\n```\r\n`avgMessagePerEntry` is the history average message number per entry and `new Value` is the message number per entry in the fetch request the broker read from cache or bookkeeper. `avgPercent` is a final value 0.9, and the value just control the history avgMessagePerEntry decay rate when update new one. The avgMessagePerEntry initial value is 1000.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with consumer fetch request, it will map fetch requst number to entry number according to the following formula:\r\n```\r\nmessagesToRead = Math.min((int) Math.ceil(availablePermits * 1.0 / avgMessagesPerEntry), readBatchSize);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also expose the avgMessagePerEntry static value to consumer stat metric

If I understand correctly all consumers can't get new messages if a new consumer joined right? The messages will add to the redelivery queue will lead to the next read entry operation replay the redelivery queue so that new messages can't keep going. This may cause an increase in consumption latency for all consumers. But, I think most of the existing consumers can continue to consume new messages because they do not overlap with the newly added consumer in any hash range. \r\n\r\nSo in the #6977, I added a buffer for the messages that need to wait for mark delete position processed. This can minimize the consumption latency jitter caused by the newly added consumer especially when consumers are hungry. This will be more useful for e2e latency-sensitive scenes. I want to listen to your thoughts, maybe my thoughts are more worrying.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I have no objections to this PR. And except added a buffer, I think #6977 is the same, #6977 added a field in the consumer named `fencePositionForKeyShared `. Essentially, equivalent to `recentlyJoinedConsumers` in this
