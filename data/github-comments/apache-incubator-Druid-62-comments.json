However I don't see a way to retain this information in ganglia, without excluding some metrics based on their dimension values (i.e. filtering). Once you get into metrics that include segment_id, this kind of filtering no longer seems feasibly.  Therefore, I felt like giving up some information (i.e. not being able to drill down), is preferable to needing to know the dimensions I want to keep across all the separate metrics.\n\nUnless I have misunderstood, and what you are suggesting is that we emit a configurable number of dimensions? (i.e. include queryType dimension, but not segmentId).  This makes more sense to me, but would make the in memory aggregation I am doing potentially risky, if you configured to include segmentId.\n\nAfter reading a little more, it seems like the second one.  In this case, it is effectively a group by on the dimensions you care about (as opposed to filtering on dimension values). This makes more sense to me, but would still require that you aggregate over the unspecified dimensions (Either in your metric store or in the emitter, I am not sure how this is handled in the graphite emitter).  If we decide that this kind of configurable metric grouping is important, I feel like it should be implemented one level up, instead of repeated in every emitter extension.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/179515618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/179518151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2216#issuecomment-179518151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2216","id":179518151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTUxODE1MQ==","user":{"login":"pjain1","id":11787983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzg3OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11787983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1","html_url":"https://github.com/pjain1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T22:58:01Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T22:58:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:

Everything we are discussing are just means to mitigate the fact that Ganglia cannot handle high-cardinality metrics.\n\nAllowing the user to choose which dimensions are included does not solve this problem:  \n- If you configure the process to include another dimension, you are not \"drilling down\" into an existing metric, in Ganglia you are creating a fully new set of timelines/metrics (for each value of the dimension you are now including).  \n- Unless your emitter continues to emit at the lower granularity (still not a drill-down, now just an additional metric), you are losing information at the lower granularity, and Ganglia is not going to sum across multiple separate timelines to reconstruct this.\n\nTo me, this was reason enough to simply aggregate across all of the dimensions.  This provides a view of your cluster that is amenable to the way Ganglia does things.

this is statd's stated purpose. Also 0 aggregation is done in in the emitter, so I am not sure why you are concerned this will \"blow away the druid process\". As we discussed (at great length) in the Ganglia pull request, this type of filtering does not really solve its intended problem.  \n\nMy reasoning regarding the cardinality problem was as such:\n- Filtering out any metrics that have any high cardinality dimension (as in the Graphite emitter). This works, but you are throwing away many useful metrics. (e.g. Historical's query/wait/time and query/segment/time are pretty much off limits due to their high cardinality dimension (segment)) -- I see that the json file allows you to specify some number of dimensions to keep.  In the condition that you do not include the full set of dimensions (many of the default cases), how are metrics from different dimension values aggregated? Is Graphite doing this for you? If it is simply plotting them all on the same time-series, you will see some strange things for certain metrics.\n- Aggregate across these dimensions in the emitter.  This works in principle (and so long as the # of base metric names stays reasonably small, which it already is, will fit in memory no problem), however you really want to be able to configure the aggregations you are doing, and for what metric prefix you aggregate across.  This seems like its going to be a lot of configuration...\n- StatsD is a metric aggregator and forwarder for Graphite and Ganglia.  With a system like this, we can emit metrics at their full granularity from druid, but still get all of the fancy aggregation we want from a system purpose built for this
