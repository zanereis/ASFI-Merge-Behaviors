I guess i will only ask one question that seem still unclear to me.  In your google docs you mention that admin could create a new role to allow read/write access on a set of dag. Is there a feature that allows you to group dag in a set and then use the group to filter them ? I see that we can set filter all_dag and by dag_id which means we need to select each individual dag an add it to role permissions ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/398731109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/398731276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3520#issuecomment-398731276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3520","id":398731276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODczMTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T12:28:46Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T12:28:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@feng-tao I believe the API of FAB is still in beta and subject to change in future.

I think the discussion about how to integrate this with existing hooks is an important issue, but it is not quite clear for me how this would best be solved. \r\n\r\nThe new SFTP hook implements most functionality of the existing hook, so dropping that hook from contrib would be possible, at the cost of changing the interface. I think this would be acceptable if the changes are integrated into a new major version of Airflow, rather than a new minor version. We can integrate any missing functionality into the new hook.\r\n\r\nThe existing S3 hook is a bit more difficult, as the new hook represents S3 as a file system, whilst the existing hook stays closer to the notion of S3 as a key-based blob store. As such, methods such as `select_key` and `list_prefixes` have no clear meaning in my proposed S3FsHook, as these aren't file system concepts. We could integrate some of these methods into the S3FsHook, but it would dilute the interface considerably, I fear. \r\n\r\nI think the two options we have are to:\r\n\r\n1. Keep two separate hooks, one for S3 as a file system and one for S3 as a blob store.\r\n2. Keep both interfaces, but separate the blob store interface into a sub-property of the hook to keep the interfaces separate. This would still require separating the existing S3Hook from the AwsHook base class, to avoid multiple inheritance (as we would need to inherit from both FsHook and AwsHook otherwise). S3Hook could still use the AwsHook through composition, as the only thing the AwsHook is really needed for is fetching the client and/or credentials. The only other option would be to make FsHook a mixin, but I fear that that would lead to dilution of the interface. \r\n\r\nI would be keen to hear your ideas on this.

But it works pretty well for me. And given airflow api is also experimental, I think they are considered equally readiness.\r\n\r\nI am wondering how you use the airflow api stuffs(or how does your deployment looks like)? Are you going to deploy two webservers, one serves UI and another serves api? Consolidate the api into modelView(once FAB becomes default UI) will be better imo. In that case UI, cli, api request could all serve by FAB model CRUD instead of two different places.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/398988665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/398990814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3506#issuecomment-398990814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3506","id":398990814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODk5MDgxNA==","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T06:28:46Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T18:46:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@feng-tao I do not understand why does a scheduler config have to do with webserver start up time.
