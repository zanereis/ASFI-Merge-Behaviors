I was also using /mnt for other stuff - as a general scratch drive, storing intermediate indexing files, log files, etc. so I needed to reserve some space for this - let's say I reserved 2G. I had 8G left, so I set the size of the segment cache for /mnt to 8G.\r\n\r\nNow, what do I set the size of the segment cache for /mnt1 to? If I set it to 10G to fully utilize the volume and at a point in time have less than 2G of data, it would all be on /mnt1 and potentially wouldn't be maximizing the I/O throughput available. I could instead set it to 8G to be the same as /mnt and that would evenly distribute the segments, but I'd lose those 2G unnecessarily just to coax the algorithm to utilize both locations.\r\n\r\nA round-robin strategy (or one that selects the location that has the least bytes used in absolute terms instead of relative to the capacity) would have been what I wanted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509948508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/509997974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8025#issuecomment-509997974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8025","id":509997974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTk5Nzk3NA==","user":{"login":"snownd","id":30339830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzM5ODMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30339830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd","html_url":"https://github.com/snownd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snownd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T10:02:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T10:02:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">The major difference between the two is that the Scan query does not support pagination.

What I'm thinking is pretty similar to yours, but a bit additional stuffs. \r\n\r\n- MM will keep expiration time in memory. \r\n- This expiration time is initialized with `current time + configured timeout`. \r\n- MM periodically checks there are any new partitions created for new supervisorTasks and initializes the expiration time if it finds any.\r\n- When a subtask accesses a partition, the expiration time for the supervisorTask is initialized or updated if it's already there.\r\n- MM periodically checks those expiration times for supervisorTasks. If it finds any expired supervisorTask, then it will ask the overlord if the task is still running. If not, MM will remove all partitions for the supervisorTask.\r\n- The overlord will also send a cleanup request to MM when the supervisorTask is finished. This will clean up the expiration time.\r\n\r\nI think it's not very complex, but will reduce the number of calls to overlord API, so it would be good.\r\n\r\n> it would be extra nice to document the failure cases and expected behavior e.g.\r\n\r\nAh, I didn't document them since it would be same with the existing parallel index task behavior.\r\nHere are descriptions on how it handles failures currently.\r\n\r\n> supervisor task process (or MM running it) crashed while phase1/2 tasks were running\r\n\r\nIf the supervisorTask process is killed normally, `stopGracefully` method is called which kills all running subtasks. If it's killed abnormally, then parallel index task doesn't handle this case for now.\r\n\r\n> one or more of phase1/2 tasks crashed\r\n\r\nSupervisorTask monitors subtask statuses and counts how many subtasks have failed to process the same input. If it notices more failures than configured `maxRetry`, it regards that input can't be processed and exists with an error. Otherwise, it respawns a new task which processes the same input.\r\n\r\nI'll add these to the proposal.\r\n\r\n> are any/all of these tasks restorable i.e. return true for canRestore() ?\r\n\r\nGood point. Any task is not restorable now, but I think it might be useful to support rolling update in the future. Parallel index tasks are supposed to run for a long time and so it would be nice if it can be stopped/restored during rolling update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/510699299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/510700582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7953#issuecomment-510700582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7953","id":510700582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDcwMDU4Mg==","user":{"login":"ajcrutch","id":7732675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzI2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcrutch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcrutch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T00:31:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T00:31:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

that is fine and I am guessing it will batch task status call i.e. ask status of multiple supervisor tasks in one overlord api request.\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\n> will the worker tasks complete and exit eventually or they will be left running till manual intervention ?\r\n\r\nAll subtasks report the pushed segments to the supervisor task at the end of indexing. So, if the supervisor task is not running, then they would end up being failed at this stage. However, this is still quite annoying since they will occupy middleManager resources unnecessarily. I guess we could add some health check to subtasks for the supervisor task.\r\n\r\n> we might consider making supervisor real \"supervisor\" like Kafka instead of \"task\" so that they get special powers to manage things better ? but I think I am remembering some comment that they are made tasks because tasks are better equipped to work with locking framework available. one option could be to let spawned worker task do the locking , since all worker tasks would be in same group so multiple worker tasks trying to obtain same lock would still work..... this is unverified wishful thinking :)\r\n\r\nYeah, my original intention was to add a \"supervisor\" like Kafka rather than a new task type, but I changed my mind to use the existing task lock type system. And now I'm inclined to keep the current design of supervisor task because\r\n\r\n- \"supervisor\" is designed for more like stream ingestion for each dataSource. It runs forever once it's submitted and the history of its spec changes is recorded in metadata store. \r\n- \"supervisor\" design is less scalable since the overlord handles all supervisors and requests/responses for their tasks. One of our customers already had some issue with this. They were running more than 1000 tasks for each Kafka supervisor. Kafka ingestion got stuck because their overlord couldn't handle too many HTTP requests from tasks in time.\r\n\r\nFor the second reason, I would upvote to even demote the Kafka/Kinesis supervisor to the supervisor task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/511029723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/511030648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8005#issuecomment-511030648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8005","id":511030648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTAzMDY0OA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T20:56:16Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T20:56:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased
