The goal described in the Jira issue is specifically related to NAR bundles. Although a NAR bundle may not contain direct duplication of dependencies, the hierarchical nature of NAR dependencies means that a child NAR could have the same library as a parent NAR, making the extra dependency unnecessary in the child NAR. This kind of relationship is not necessarily detected through the maven-enforcer-plugin because NAR bundles are specific to Apache NiFi.

The core of this issue is that `MergeContent` cannot handle when _any single tar entry_ is larger than 8.5GB. It has no issue creating tar archives which end up being larger than 8.5GB in total. The output mode needs to be set on the entire tar archive, so i feel this is an all or nothing thing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could compute whether any one tar entry (e.g. FlowFile) is larger than 8.5GB and if that's the case then we set the `bigNumberMode()` and otherwise leave the implementation as is. I believe the only other alternative is to add a processor property to have it always/never set the `bigNumberMode()`.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1266567555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1266954762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6053#issuecomment-1266954762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6053","id":1266954762,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5LhDIK","user":{"login":"MaheshKungaria","id":112639146,"node_id":"U_kgDOBra8qg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112639146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria","html_url":"https://github.com/MaheshKungaria","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaheshKungaria/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-04T12:56:51Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T12:56:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @davyam - May I know that when we can expect the \"CaptureChangePostgreSQL\" processor in actual released version of Nifi.

I started out extending the existing user group provider for Azure but ultimately thought that perhaps it is confusing to users that the same component has these two quite different capabilities.\r\n\r\nThat said, specifying \"Object ID\" could enable the retrieval of app roles as an optional configuration for the existing AzureGraphUserGroupProvider. In fact, in both cases, Azure Graph API is used (just quite differently).\r\n\r\nBut then what about the various existing options such as group filter? Today it is a required option because it is expected that we'll be querying for users and groups. While one could solve this by having a strategy property, perhaps one wants both modes enabled at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhile specifying \"Object ID\" could be the enabler for retrieving app roles, what would be the _disabler_ for trying to retrieve users and groups?\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that perhaps it's simply because these two user group providers are different enough to warrant their own classes.
