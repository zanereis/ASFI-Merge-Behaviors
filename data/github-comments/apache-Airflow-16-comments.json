For example, a daily trend batch (1) and a trend diff batch (2) that processes the results of (1) over the last 7 days. In that example, (2) should be scheduled for the first time only after 7 days of results of (1) are available.\n\nAt the moment, an operator can only declare an upstream dependency towards another operator with identical execution date (via `set_upstream()` ), or towards itself with execution date being the latest previously scheduled (via `depends_on_past=True`). \n\nAirflow also allows to build the operator (2) with a start_date explicitly set to 7 days after the start_that of (1), but this seems to be a concern leaking from the Airflow scheduler to the developer designing the DAG: ideally Airflow would resolve that start_date by itself. Also, this start_date does not enforce that the execution of (2) will happen after all the required executions of (1) are finished. \n\nIt seems that `ExternalTaskSensor` (with several DAGs) cannot be used for that purpose either because it has no direct influence on the scheduling but rather allows the corresponding task(s) to be launched and kept waiting. In the example above, that would yield 7 instances of task (2) in case of a `LocalExecutor` or `CeleriExecutor`, or even just one of them at a time in case of a `SequencialExecutor` until one of them blocks forever, which would halt the whole task sequence. \n\nOur suggested resolution would be a PR along he following lines: \n- in `DAG`, add an `execution_calendar` object which relies on `utils.date_range` and `self.schedule_interval` to provide the execution dates to be scheduled (among others, required in `BackfillJob`) as well as the past execution dates. + adapt `BackfillJob` and others accordingly.\n- in `DAG` and `BaseOperator`, adapt the `set_dependency`, `set_downstream` and others to allow to declare a number of past upstream executions (defaulting to 1), possibly with new `DownstreamDependency` and `UpstreamDependency` classes. We would not declare if those past executions need to be successful or not, since this concern is already captured by `task.trigger_rule`.\n- in `TaskInstance.are_dependencies_met()`, adapt the SQLAlchemy query to rely on the DAG `execution_calendar` as well as on the number of past upstream executions of each upstream dependency to query the status of depended upon tasks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/153420840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/153456859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/417#issuecomment-153456859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/417","id":153456859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzQ1Njg1OQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T19:08:47Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T19:08:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will have a intern in my team from January onwards, who is will be implementing a predictor of when jobs will actually finish (ie. giving an eta to a DAG and maybe their individual tasks).

Also for change management as you introduce new tasks to a DAG, it's an important piece of metadata that the scheduler can't guess\n- `start_date` also informs `depends_on_past` to not be applied on that first date\n\nIt does make sense to add more functionality to the dependency engine, and time ranges is reasonable. There's already a fairly complex flow for understanding \"why isn't my task getting triggered\" and I want to make sure that we keep or increase the level of clarity around that as we make the engine more flexible.\n\nI think \"Trigger Rules\" might become the place to store rules more complex than \"this task depends on this task\". In its most complex form, you could have arbitrarily complex rules that could be combined in complex ways. Picture something like `trigger_rules=(DependOnPast(self) and FullDagExecution('some_other_dag')) or AllHellBreaksLoose()`. \n\nIn the meantime it's pretty easy to write custom sensors, what about an alternative to `ExternalTaskSensor` that can take date ranges as input and be start_date aware?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/153581806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/153701310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/577#issuecomment-153701310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/577","id":153701310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzcwMTMxMA==","user":{"login":"thoralf-gutierrez","id":5640848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDA4NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5640848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez","html_url":"https://github.com/thoralf-gutierrez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thoralf-gutierrez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T12:09:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T12:09:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your answer !\n\nIndeed, we see where you coming from for the start_date, thanks for clarifying.\n\nWe're happy to see that you're also interested in more functionalities such as the time ranges.\n\nWe totally agree with the need for clarity.

This grammar would allow to parametrize upstreams dependencies with time ranges and expected status (success, failure, etc) and to compose them with logical operators.\n\nHere's a link to an overview of a suggested refactoring of the API which includes all those concerns as well as the task runnable state and justification that could be displayed in the UI.
