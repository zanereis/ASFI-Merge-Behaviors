data quality checking pipelines behind usual ETL pipelines.\r\n```\r\n\r\nETLJob  ---> ETLJob will becomes\r\n\r\nETLJob           ---> ETLJob\r\n    |                  ^\r\n    |                  | (optional) \r\n    ---> DQJob -\r\n\r\n```\r\nAbout scheduling, I think each data org already has its own scheduler, scheduling their daily data jobs.\r\nSo it is really hard to ask them to setup and support a new scheduler, I want to leverage existing scheduler, we just need to generate job plan and somehow ingest our data quality jobs into existing job DAG. \r\nOf course, we can provide a default scheduler, but this scheduler is replaceable.\r\n\r\nfor data lineage, which is very important for troubleshooting, especially when data quality issue has been identified and we need to fix data qualtiy issue, we need go through lineage to fix the origin code, no matter it is SQL or python .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/2185750569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/2185756636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/griffin/pull/654#issuecomment-2185756636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/654","id":2185756636,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBOPBm86CR__c","user":{"login":"chitralverma","id":11135032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTM1MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11135032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma","html_url":"https://github.com/chitralverma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chitralverma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-24T07:00:31Z","updated_at":"2024-06-24T07:00:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"okay,
