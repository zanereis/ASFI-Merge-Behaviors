Some users still use old partition methodology like:\r\n```\r\norders_20170101\r\norders_20170102\r\n```\r\nSo in this use case the table isn't temp and also the table doesn't have consist name. Each time the query may refer to another date. This can be used with DAG execution_date for example.\r\n\r\nAnother reason I added it is because `BigQueryGetDataOperator `have `table_id `as template field. So same reasons it was added there are applied here :) \r\nI must say I'm confused why table has so many different references names (`table`, `table_id`, `source_project_dataset_table  `etc..) in BigQuery operators but I guess that someday it will be refactored and standardized.

The intention of this PR is to build plugin hooks to allow users to write pip packaged packages which can provide DAG loading functionality without modifying the airflow core repo.\r\n\r\nI'm still actively working on this, but due to the large scale of the Airflow development environment and the long turnaround time in running tests, it's slow going. Any help on this PR is much welcomed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/483147174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/483165780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3138#issuecomment-483165780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3138","id":483165780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzE2NTc4MA==","user":{"login":"dthauvin","id":8190978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTA5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8190978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin","html_url":"https://github.com/dthauvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dthauvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-15T08:53:02Z","updated_at":"2019-04-15T08:53:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello
