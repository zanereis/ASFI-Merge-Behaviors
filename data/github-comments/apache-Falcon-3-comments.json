If you look at authorizeAdminResource it is what validates if the user has admin privileges. \n\nIn startup.properties\n\n```\n# The name of the group of super-users\n*.falcon.security.authorization.superusergroup=falcon\n\n# Admin Users, comma separated users\n*.falcon.security.authorization.admin.users=falcon,ambari-qa\n\n# Admin Group Membership, comma separated users\n*.falcon.security.authorization.admin.groups=falcon,staff\n```\n\nAll admin users are not super users. \n\nAlso in the code isSuperUser method validates only if user is super user or in super user group. authorizeAdminResource vaildates the admin user.\n\nIf admin user is not super user then safemode then current code doesn't validate the user. \n\n```\n            if (isSuperUser(authenticatedUGI)) {\n                return;\n            }\n\n            if (\"admin\".equals(resource)) {\n                if (!(\"version\".equals(action) || \"clearuser\".equals(action) || \"getuser\".equals(action))) {\n                    authorizeAdminResource(authenticatedUGI, action);\n                }\n```\n\nI don't think current code works for admin user. Did you test it for admin user not super user case?\n\nRegarding the doc please remove or update \" \"UI support for safemode\" section to refer the previous section then. Thanks! \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/214907364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/214909644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/falcon/pull/116#issuecomment-214909644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/116","id":214909644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDkwOTY0NA==","user":{"login":"bvellanki","id":7927462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mjc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7927462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki","html_url":"https://github.com/bvellanki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T22:43:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T22:43:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sowmyaramesh Please look at the code again. \n`if (isSuperUser(authenticatedUGI)) {\n                return;\n            }`\n\nThis part would let a super user perform setsafemode action.
