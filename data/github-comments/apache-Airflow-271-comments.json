The breeze environment is also optional, but it is recommended to use it. Changes to patches should also be possible for people who do not want to use the Breeze environment. Airflow is used by many companies and they may have their own forks, so additional files in the patch will hinder cherry-pick.\r\n\r\nBTW.

Let me know what you think about what I proposed below:\r\n\r\nCurrently, in `_find_executable_task_instances` loop, for metrics collection purpose, we issue one sql query and multiple statsds calls per pool. We can move all these instrumentation overhead into the end of the loop in `_execute_helper()` in scheduler_job.py. That way, we get the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. the actual scheduling logic can finish as fast as it can without having to wait for metrics collection code, which has nothing to do with the scheduling logic itself. we can even run the metrics collection code in a separate loop in a separate thread to reduce the overhead to minimal if needed.\r\n2. the code is more decoupled and readable by separating out the metrics collection code from the actual scheduling logic.\r\n3. if we collect metrics for all pools in one place instead through a loop iteration, we can get all the stats we need efficiently from DB in just one SQL query.\r\n\r\nAs for what's the right value to use to report, I think we should settle down on only reporting committed values whenever appropriate. i.e. metrics should be calculated using data from persistent datastore. For example, if a variable is updated in memory, but not committed to DB, it shouldn't be reported. Because a crash before the commit could invalidate the metric. There are rare cases where we do want to report uncommitted value as metric, but usually those are for troubleshooting purposes, which shouldn't apply to the metrics we are dealing with here.\r\n\r\nFor the in memory open slot metric specifically, in `_find_executable_task_instances`, the task instance hasn't been scheduled to run yet, so it would be misleading to report the in memory value of the new open slot count as metric, it is only used as an internal counter to decide how many tasks to schedule. If the scheduler crashed before it was able to schedule those prepared tasks and commit to DB, we should make sure those in memory states are not reported, because a later restart won't resume from it.\r\n\r\nBy moving the metrics collection code out of `_find_executable_task_instances` and into `_execute_helper`, we won't have to worry about which value to pick to report, we will just report what's been committed in the database.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/552706447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/552715725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6551#issuecomment-552715725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6551","id":552715725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjcxNTcyNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T03:16:19Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T03:16:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6551](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/d25ef2b2abc3da9f5725a3c433bc035b970eec23?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.28%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #6551      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   84.07%   83.78%   -0.29%     \n==========================================\n  Files         639      639              \n  Lines       36900    36900              \n==========================================\n- Hits        31024    30917     -107     \n- Misses       5876     5983     +107\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/jobs/local\\_task\\_job.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzL2xvY2FsX3Rhc2tfam9iLnB5) | `90% <100%> (+5%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/kube\\_client.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL2t1YmVfY2xpZW50LnB5) | `33.33% <0%> (-41.67%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `70.14% <0%> (-28.36%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6551?src=pr&el=footer).

It never ever happened to me. I am super surprised because exactly the same check is run on Travis as in your local environment. \r\n\r\nI suggest you enable it and let me know when it happens again. I am happy to take a look when it happens again and help to find the reason (if this is really so frequent). You are the only person I know who has this problem so it would be worth checking what's wrong in your setup and prevent it happening also for others.\r\n\r\nIf you look now at Travis - there is an over-indent in test_hdfs which would have been detected locally if you have pre-commits enabled. That's the whole point of pre-commit.\r\n\r\nRe. Import above - can you please explain what was wrong? The change above is not pre-commit - but simply isort in the works. What's wrong about this? The isort sorting algorithm is such that the \"airflow\" (my) imports are always at the end.  We all agreed we use isort so we should follow it.\r\nWas it failing in Travis static checks or unit tests? If the latter and there is a good reason to keep sorting, then it should be as simple as disabling isort for the affected line or even for the whole file: https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#skip-processing-of-imports-outside-of-configuration\r\n\r\nOr we can configure skip rules in setup.cfg\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of those help.

While trying to fix and tests the kubernetes tests I noticed how difficult it was to iterate and re-test Kubernetes tests, so this one is now optimising even more:\r\n\r\n1) Only the basic image for CI is built outside and sent to the docker. It is sent via untarred folder rather than as whole file. This makes it much nicer for the slow Mac Host->Docker volume mounting because the untarred image save contains separate .tars for all Docker image layers. I sync the layer dir via rsync based on checksum - this way I make sure than whenever the CI image is rebuilt, only the last rebuilt layers are changed. Then when the image is imported to DinD only the last layers are updated. this way while the environment is up and running and images are loaded to DiND and cluster, only incremental changes will be loaded.\r\n\r\n2) Then I came back to building the kubernetes image inside breeze container. I will speed it up more, but it is actually much better for iterating when you are inside the breeze container. In order to reload last image to the cluster you will just need to run \"rebuild_ariflow_image.sh\" inside the container and it will (incrementally of course) rebuild and sent the new image layers to DiND and then to cluster.\r\n\r\nI am still working on fixing the tests but I think it is much more developer-friendly than before.\r\n\r\n
