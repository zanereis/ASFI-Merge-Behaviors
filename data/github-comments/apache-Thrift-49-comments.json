However, the Java server uses TLS1.2 by default and does not support TLS1.3.\r\n\r\nThis gives me doubt about whether the root cause was identified correctly and precisely. TLS protocol, just like every other good protocol, has versions, and allows both the client and the server to support multiple versions. As long as the Java server speaks TLS1.2, any client which speaks TLS1.2 should be able to connect â€” regardless of TLS1.3.\r\n\r\n> The Erlang community released OTP-23 in May this year.\r\n\r\nBTW, last successful build of `master` on Travis is **7 months** old. I am in doubt whether Erlang update is really relevant. But I understand that it certainly makes finding the real root cause more complicated.\r\n\r\n> It may be set to OTP-22.\r\n\r\nThat's not a good idea. It will only entrench the stagnation and multiply the effort to update for the next engineer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/670445558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/670813116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2169#issuecomment-670813116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2169","id":670813116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDgxMzExNg==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-08T02:52:09Z","updated_at":"2020-08-08T02:52:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Diving into Erlang is joy.\r\n\r\nI did a bit of testing on this... Except for the fiddly setup and a few deprecation-updates needed, the Erlang library looks mostly functional. All unit-tests under `lib/erl/test` pass (well, after you've had enough fun with the setup required to run them).\r\n\r\nI also run the Erlang client on **OTP 23** against some implementations, including the Java server from the cross-test suite. Findings:\r\n * The Erlang client does connect to `openssl s_server` using TLS1.2.\r\n * The Erlang client does connect to `openssl s_server` using TLS1.3.\r\n * The Erlang client does connect to `openssl s_server` using TLS1.2 with client cert required (`-Verify 2`).\r\n * The Erlang client does connect to `openssl s_server` using TLS1.3 with client cert required (`-Verify 2`).\r\n * The Erlang client **does not** connect to `socat - openssl-listen:9008,cert=test/keys/server.pem,cafile=test/keys/CA.pem` despite using the very same OpenSSL; error produced:\r\n\r\n       socat[1847925] E SSL_accept(): error:1417C086:SSL routines:tls_process_client_certificate:certificate verify failed\r\n\r\n   I tend to think it's a bug in how `socat` instructs the openssl API to verify client certs. Didn't investigate this deeper.\r\n\r\n * The Java cross-test server [on git master] claims to only support **TLS1.3**: \r\n ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/365338/89737620-e9b46380-da7a-11ea-9ebe-3829262c2c51.png)\r\n\r\n   Which is [really really weird](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/). I'm not sure this is intentional. Somebody needs to check this. @zeshuai007 please see above; bytes on the wire directly contradict your claim *\"the Java server uses TLS1.2 by default and does not support TLS1.3\"*. It shows the opposite: TLS1.3 *only* is advertised by the Java server. I'm running `openjdk version \"11.0.8\" 2020-07-14`.\r\n\r\n * You can run a section of the Thrift cross-test suite (a.k.a. \"Apache Thrift - Integration Test Suite\") directly:\r\n\r\n       ./test.py --server java --client erl --regex ip-ssl\r\n   \r\n    This runs in ~20 seconds. Still way faster than waiting many basketball games for Travis to run it. :wink: \r\n\r\n * Finally: the TLS 1.3 connection from Erlang client to Java server **does not** go well indeed. Here's a debug dump from Erlang side: [java-erl-tls1.3_client.log](https://github.com/apache/thrift/files/5048136/java-erl_binary_buffered-ip-ssl_client.log). It appears that the Java server is doing something that makes the Erlang client crash :/\r\n\r\n    Anyhow, **all tests pass** if I restrict Erlang to only TLS 1.2 & TLS 1.1:\r\n    ```\r\n    ulidtko@pasocon ~/s/t/test (master)> ./test.py --server java --client erl\r\n    Apache Thrift - Integration Test Suite\r\n    Sun Aug 09 20:37:26 2020\r\n    ===============================================================================\r\n    server-client:          protocol:         transport:               result:\r\n    java-erl                binary            buffered-ip              success\r\n    java-erl                binary            fastframed-framed-ip     success\r\n    java-erl                binary            framed-ip                success\r\n    java-erl                binary            fastframed-framed-ip-ssl success\r\n    java-erl                binary            framed-ip-ssl            success\r\n    java-erl                binary            buffered-ip-ssl          success\r\n    java-erl                multic-compact    framed-ip                success\r\n    java-erl                multic-compact    buffered-ip              success\r\n    java-erl                multic-compact    framed-ip-ssl            success\r\n    java-erl                multic-compact    buffered-ip-ssl          success\r\n    java-erl                multic-compact    fastframed-framed-ip     success\r\n    java-erl                multic-compact    fastframed-framed-ip-ssl success\r\n    java-erl                multi-binary      framed-ip                success\r\n    java-erl                multi-binary      buffered-ip              success\r\n    java-erl                multi-binary      fastframed-framed-ip     success\r\n    java-erl                multi-binary      framed-ip-ssl            success\r\n    java-erl                multi-binary      buffered-ip-ssl          success\r\n    java-erl                multi-binary      fastframed-framed-ip-ssl success\r\n    java-erl                compact           framed-ip                success\r\n    java-erl                compact           framed-ip-ssl            success\r\n    java-erl                compact           buffered-ip              success\r\n    java-erl                compact           fastframed-framed-ip     success\r\n    java-erl                compact           buffered-ip-ssl          success\r\n    java-erl                compact           fastframed-framed-ip-ssl success\r\n    ===============================================================================\r\n    No unexpected failures.\r\n    ```\r\n    ...

When negotiating with the Erlang client over the TLS protocol, the Java8 server does not support TLS1.3. I think we should revert to the actual scenario because JDK8 was used in the Travis-ci integration test. Can you use JDK8 to retest it? \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nZezeng Wang ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/671673004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/671806409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2160#issuecomment-671806409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2160","id":671806409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTgwNjQwOQ==","user":{"login":"sveneld","id":4028769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjg3Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4028769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld","html_url":"https://github.com/sveneld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sveneld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T08:25:52Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T08:25:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jens-G it's enough for merging pull request?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/671806409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/672225995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2197#issuecomment-672225995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2197","id":672225995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjIyNTk5NQ==","user":{"login":"ulidtko","id":365338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTMzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko","html_url":"https://github.com/ulidtko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulidtko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T19:39:53Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T19:39:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @zeshuai007 â€” well, that totally makes sense.\r\n\r\nI retested with Java 8 (OpenJDK as before).\r\n\r\nThe result with Java8 (for `test.py --server java --client erl` only) is **success of all tests** for me. Both with TLS1.3 allowed and disallowed for the Erlang client â€” the java server doesn't offer TLS1.3, exactly as you say; so it just negotiates down to TLS1.2, and all proceeds well from there.\r\n\r\nWhich is a puzzling result. I remember seeing this failure on Travis â€” but can no longer find any build exhibiting it. Do you perhaps have a link to such a build on Travis?\r\n\r\nI did found [one](https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/thrift/jobs/665484688) from March 22, which has reached running the `cross` step â€” and had passed all of it (log line 21337 onwards). Notice (log line 13268) that it used Java 11!\r\n\r\nThat confused me at first, since Java11 + Erlang23 = TLS1.3 = broken according to my testing, should not have passed â€” but as you mention, Erlang/OTP 23 was only released in May, later than the build I linked.\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think that Java 8 is in use?

If there is no better solution, setting up TLS1.2+TLS1.1 temporarily will look great as setting up Erlang22, but it will require two or more post-maintenance. I saw the ticket you submitted in Erlang, and I look forward to the Erlang expert's investigation. \r\nI have plans to learn Erlang recently, and unfortunately for some reason I'm focusing on C, but I'll be back. \r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nZezeng Wang ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/674345204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/674489456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2159#issuecomment-674489456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2159","id":674489456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQ4OTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-16T07:06:01Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T07:06:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Let me convince you that this is noise and Java8 is not actually used. Two reasons:\r\n * This line 12340 is part of output from `printenv | sort` from `build/docker/run.sh`: it shows the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set **outside** the Docker container. It's not existing *inside* the container where `./configure` and tests run.\r\n * If it was â€” we'd see *Oracle* JDK 8, not OpenJDK, in the output of `./configure` (line 13101).\r\n\r\nI'm glad to collaborate for the public good and for safe and sustainable future of technology.
