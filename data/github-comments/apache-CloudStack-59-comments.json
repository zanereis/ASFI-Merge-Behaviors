I looked at the code and did not find any sleep or any sort of wait, so looping 30 times will go quite fast:\n\nThe block inside the for loop would be this one:\n\n```\n           while read line; do\n             if [[ $line == cmdline:* ]]; then\n               cmd=${line//cmdline:/}\n               echo $cmd > /var/cache/cloud/cmdline\n             elif [[ $line == pubkey:* ]]; then\n               pubkey=${line//pubkey:/}\n               echo $pubkey > /var/cache/cloud/authorized_keys\n               echo $pubkey > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n             fi\n           done < /dev/vport0p1\n           # In case of reboot we do not send the boot args again.\n           # So, no need to wait for them, as the boot args are already set at startup\n           if [ -s /var/cache/cloud/cmdline  ]\n           then\n               log_it \"Found a non empty cmdline file. Will now exit the loop and proceed with configuration.\"\n               break;\n           fi\n```\n\nIf my assumption is right, about the 30 times loop, I would suggest to do it in a different way. For example:\n\n```\nlocal factor=2\nlocal progress=1\nfor i in {1..5}\ndo\n    #block mentioned above\n    sleep ${progress}\n    progress=$[ progress * factor]\ndone\n```\n\nIn a worst case scenario we would wait 16 seconds before then leave the for loop.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/149808138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/149809643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/958#issuecomment-149809643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/958","id":149809643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTgwOTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T08:00:42Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T08:04:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"##
