is a very strange model in that there are multiple ONNX `Loop` for no good reason. In particular, there is a loop at the beginning that does input image preprocessing, and for some reason the output of the loop is already dynamic in all dimensions. So the input to the first convolution op is already dynamic in H and W dimensions, which result in the error above.\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n%37 = subtract(%36, meta[relay.Constant][5] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1, 1, 1), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(?, ?, ?, ?), float32] */;\r\n%38 = nn.conv2d(%37, meta[relay.Constant][6] /* ty=Tensor[(32, 3, 3, 3), float32] */, strides=[2, 2], padding=[0, 0, 1, 1], kernel_size=[3, 3]) /* ty=Tensor[(?, 32, ?, ?), float32] */;\r\n...\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI have a feeling that our ONNX `Loop` support does not preserve static shape information precisely, since it does not make sense to have a dynamic input at the first conv2d op after the preprocessing loop. Also this could be one of the reasons MaskRCNN import does not work well with ONNX, since it has a loop and compilation fails at dynamic H and W dimension which should not exist. @jwfromm @mbrookhart ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/864467897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/864480692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8283#issuecomment-864480692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8283","id":864480692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDQ4MDY5Mg==","user":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-20T00:28:16Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T00:28:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The main reason as you mentioned is that \"uTVM\" is kinda confusing, specially for the people who are using it for the first time.

Thanks for the contribution! It is definitely a classic bug on program exit, when cuda context gets destroyed before the handle is released.\r\n> \r\n> I do believe that a better way to handle this issue is to \"let it leak\": just do not destroy the handle on exit, because the OS is going to handle it anyway.\r\n> \r\n> CC: @icemelon9\r\n\r\nAgreed. PyTorch also applies the \"let-it-leak\" mechanism b.c. their handlers are maintained by a global pool and threads reuse them. But actually, in TVM this handler is called on threads' exit (`thread_local` lifetime). So the leak might be significant if TVM kills and re-creates many threads during the whole program. So I want to confirm if it is the case? If not, \"let-it-leak\" is definitely the best approach.

mangling and e.g. the type signature changes proposed by @Mousius to one end of the compiler stack (i.e. at the relay level or at the end of the TIR passes). this way, the middle part of the compiler remains as generic as possible.\r\n\r\nwe'd like to propose the following:\r\n- let us sync and merge this PR\r\n- we'll land #7518 on top of this in the next two weeks (e.g. aiming for before July 4

While seems the CI failed on mypy but it didn't throw any error?\r\n> \r\n> In my understanding, mypy requires python files to specifie data type explicitly for function parameters and return values, but we have not yet add the missing data type to these two dirs in this PR?\r\n\r\n@jcf94  you are right. This PR does not fix the missing data types, it is only enables MyPy.\r\n\r\n At this point error logging is disabled ( by setting `ignore_errors` in `mypy.ini`). So, thats why at the end of the linting stage in Jenkins  there is the following:\r\n```\r\nChecking MyPy Type defs in auto_scheduler package.\r\n\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 17 source files\r\n\r\nChecking MyPy Type defs in runtime package.\r\n\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 13 source files\r\n```\r\nThese two dirs are serving as placeholders atm.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this PR adds the basic functionality. \r\nThen, subsequent PRs can start incrementally to fix data types in specifics  dirs and enable them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/866779625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/866781072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8306#issuecomment-866781072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8306","id":866781072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2Njc4MTA3Mg==","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T12:09:36Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T12:10:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Before merging changes to install scripts, would it be possible to check whether docker images that uses scripts can be built ?\r\nIn this case, ci_cpu will not build because tensorflow is installed after tflite is installed.\r\n\r\nWe have created a PR to fix this for now : #8312 \r\n\r\ncc : @leandron @areusch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/866781072/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/866786543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8302#issuecomment-866786543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8302","id":866786543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2Njc4NjU0Mw==","user":{"login":"jcf94","id":12119698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE5Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12119698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94","html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T12:18:23Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T12:19:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mikepapadim Thanks, that make sense to me.\r\n\r\np.s.

Part of the error message in the CI is listed below:\r\n\r\nI think this error is due to using the default schedule (from `te.create_schedule`) which does not bind the iteration axes to the GPU threads. This is a bit outside of area of understanding but the solution will be to use the respective cuda/gpu schedules for each compute in the kernel (e.g. `schedule_reduce`, `schedule_injective`, etc.).
