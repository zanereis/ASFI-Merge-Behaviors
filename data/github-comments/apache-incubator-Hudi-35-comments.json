Currently the `HoodieCleanHelper.getDeletePaths` (point 1) and `HoodieCopyOnWriteTable.scheduleClean` (point 2) return relative path already. Also the currently `IncrementalTimelineSyncFileSystemView.addCleanInstant` only handles relative path.

Currently the `HoodieCleanHelper.getDeletePaths` (point 1) and `HoodieCopyOnWriteTable.scheduleClean` (point 2) return relative path already. Also the currently `IncrementalTimelineSyncFileSystemView.addCleanInstant` only handles relative path. Please correct me if I am wrong.\r\n> \r\n> And I addressed other comments.\r\n\r\n@leesf : Sorry, my bad regarding scheduleClean comments. I confused HoodieCleanerPlan with HoodieCleanMetadata. HoodieCleanerPlan is newly added as part of 0.5.1 and stores relative paths and do not require migration. HoodieCleanMetadata though requires migration. I looked at  IncrementalTimelineSyncFileSystemView.addCleanInstant and believe this would need more handling. This method calls a common method : IncrementalTimelineSyncFileSystemView.removeFileSlicesForPartition which is shared by rollback/restore code and assumes full path. \r\n\r\n```\r\n FileStatus[] statuses = paths.stream().map(p -> {\r\n        FileStatus status = new FileStatus();\r\n        status.setPath(new Path(p));\r\n        return status;\r\n      }).toArray(FileStatus[]::new);\r\n```\r\nTo make it easy, you might need to create absolute paths in addCleanInstant before calling removeFileSlicesForPartition. Can you check this part of the code to see if it makes sense.\r\n\r\nThanks for doing this change.\r\n\r\nBalaji.V","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/561057985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/561074111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/812#issuecomment-561074111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/812","id":561074111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTA3NDExMQ==","user":{"login":"arw357","id":8440059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357","html_url":"https://github.com/arw357","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arw357/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-03T09:18:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T09:18:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried it and it does not crash - so it's ok to be cloesd","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/561074111/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/561077900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1057#issuecomment-561077900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1057","id":561077900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTA3NzkwMA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-03T09:28:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T09:29:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have pushed a new branch named `hudi_test_suite` and will keep this PR syncing with the branch.\r\nThis PR uses to discuss.

You can continue to PR against that branch. I've also fixed the issue with POM that was causing the test case failure, you may want to rebase this PR against that branch.\r\n\r\nI am comfortable that no matter use which branch. The reason why I pushed a new `hudi_test_suite` branch is [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/991#issuecomment-559362785). I pinged you and gave a time gap to wait for the suggestion. And I got the suggestion from @vinothchandar . If you can fix the conflicts based on master brach, I can return back to the `hudi_test_suite_refactor` branch. Another option, you can cherry pick your commits about pom issues into my new branch and I can rename the branch name.\r\n\r\n> Secondly, I think we should name the package - `hudi-test-suite` instead of `hudi-end-to-end-tests`, it's more concise, WDYT ?\r\n\r\nOk, agree. After coming to an agreement on the branch problem, we can fix the module naming problem.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also, can we execute on the following plan :\r\n> \r\n> 1. Please go over all the changes in the existing PR - I've addressed most of the comments.\r\n\r\nThere were too many comments in the old PR #991. Reviewing that PR will spend too much time, let's review the new PR to eliminate interruptions of outdate comments. It's a more effective way. WDYT?\r\n\r\n> 2. Let's rename the package - like you've already done\r\n\r\nOK, agree.\r\n\r\n> 3. Both of us can start to use the test suite and run them locally for 2-3 days. This will give us confidence whether the test suite is ready to test large features.\r\n\r\nOK, will try it.\r\n\r\n> 4. Let's merge this first version of the test suite to master so folks can start using it\r\n\r\nI will let @vinothchandar make the decision to see if it's the right time to merge it into the master branch.\r\n\r\n> 5. Both of us can continue to enhance the test suite - a) You can add some of the things that you mentioned earlier like DIstributedTestDataSource etc b) I want to add more use-cases\r\n> \r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n> Let me know if this sounds fair to you.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you can see I kept your code and your git commits. Something I have done is just squashed them into one to fix the conflicts.\r\n\r\nSome things may be caused by our insufficiency in communication. If we can respond to each other's information more efficiently, then maybe our work will be more efficient.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I try to respond to my Github messages every day, except on weekends or long holidays. @n3nash  Do you pay more attention to Slack? If so, I can communicate with you via Slack. Or can we create a test suite Slack group? However, IMO, communicate via Github is a better way because we can discuss code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/562401410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/562414420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1036#issuecomment-562414420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1036","id":562414420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjQxNDQyMA==","user":{"login":"zhedoubushishi","id":31263084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjYzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31263084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi","html_url":"https://github.com/zhedoubushishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T03:13:04Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T03:13:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code changes is done.

Just want to make sure that's the only thing required. \r\n\r\nI am fine with your suggestion on reviewing the new PR, agree that will help eliminate dangling comments from before. \r\n\r\n@vinothchandar Last week was thanksgiving and many people are on vacation, including me :)\r\nAs far as buildable branch stands, I pushed the changes to make them buildable 2-3 days ago. I mentioned this exact same thing in my last comment. It was slightly complex due to weird Hive POM issues and took a longer turnaround time. \r\n\r\n@vinothchandar I've addressed most of the comments and some open questions still remained (which need some conclusion). Pending item was making the branch buildable which is done now. \r\nAs @yanghua is suggesting, we might want to take another pass at the PR to resolve any of those open questions (or take a look at the old PR if one prefers). Once that is done, we want to run these tests for some time - we could do it for a week and @yanghua and I can build further on top of these changes. \r\nTo build confidence, I've also suggested @yanghua to start trying to use the framework. This will help understand and demonstrate it's usefulness (along with running these tests for sometime) before we decide to merge. \r\n\r\n@yanghua I agree, let's be active on GH (exchanges everyday except weekends and holidays) and get this framework to a very usable state in the coming couple of weeks.

I synced up with Balaji on it and we came up with a solution. Here is the gist. \r\n\r\nWithout changing the source and target schema(to add delete marker) in DeltaStreamer configs, we can't get this done. I went ahead and made changes locally (to configs, schema, source records)and was able to get it working. But before I go ahead and fix all tests, I wanted to get consensus that this is a good from usability standpoint and right way to add delete support in DeltaStreamer. \r\n\r\n- This will enforce all users of DeltaStreamer to change their schema to add this delete marker that we define(\"_hoodie_delete_marker\"). \r\n\r\nHere are two other options I could think of. \r\nOption a. Introduce a new config for delete marker key. Hoodie internal classes will assume this field as delete marker (all the way to OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload), and act accordingly. \r\ntwo concerns here:\r\n  1. Not sure if we can pass in this arg to  OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload though or how much changes this would involve. \r\n  2. As of now, I intercept the schema in SchemaProvider and append the delete marker field to both source schema. Hope thats fine? \r\n  3. This should be fixable, but still figuring out. I found ways to define an optional field in json schema, but I am yet to figure out ways to add an optional field via code i.e. new Schema.Field(String name, Schema schema, String doc, JsonNode defaultValue)) which is what is required in SchemaRegistry. For now, have added as a mandatory field. So, if we couldn't add an optional field, then all serialized records will have this delete marker for non deleted records. \r\n\r\nOption b. Introduce a predicate function that we can use while reading from source to determine whether the record is deleted or not. Will introduce an optional delete marker field(still need to figure out ways to add an optional field in code) in target schema(we can keep this our own key as \"_hoodie_delete_marker\") and proceed further. OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload will detect it and will return Optional.empty(). And so at the storage, no records will have this optional field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/562846781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/562847466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1073#issuecomment-562847466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1073","id":562847466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjg0NzQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-07T12:32:53Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T12:32:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thinking about it again, guess we shouldn't intercept the schema to add the delete marker field even with the fix I currently have(locally).
