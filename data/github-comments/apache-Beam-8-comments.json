See [here](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html) for more details.\n- We set `forkCount` to zero in the Travis environment to control memory usage. Empirically, if we set it to one, it will fail with out-of-memory issue almost always.\n\nBasically, to move forward, we'd have to investigate memory usage of individual tests and get it down. Then, we can increase `forkCount, and finally enable Jacoco in Travis.\n\nGiven that it \"somewhat works\" in Jenkins right now, that Jenkins is generally preferable over Travis, that it seems easier to fully fix Jenkins than Travis, etc., I'd just probably close this pull request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/211197960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/211310600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/104#issuecomment-211310600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/104","id":211310600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTMxMDYwMA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-18T10:10:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T10:10:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @dhalperi, I was completely knocked out for a week.
