Does coordinator auto compaction always do \"minor compaction\" ( described in #7491 )?\r\n\r\nFor now, auto compaction doesn't support minor compaction. You can do minor compaction with the compaction task by setting `forceGuaranteedRollup`.\r\n\r\nThe future plan I'm thinking of is supporting both minor and major compaction in auto compaction. Like, it will do minor compaction for recent segments while doing major compaction for old ones. There are a couple reasons why we still need major compaction. One reason could be, we can do secondary partitioning with major compaction which could accelerate query performance by further pruning segments.\r\n\r\n> 2. Same `CompactionTask` is used for both \"minor\" as well as \"major\" compaction. It is major compaction when either of \"interval\" or \"segmentGranularity\" fields are explicitly provided ?\r\n\r\nGood question. It is the major compaction if 1) `forceGuaranteedRollup` is true or 2) `segmentGranularity` is provided explicitly. The second condition should actually be \"if the provided segment granularity is different from that of input segments\". But I was lazy to implement it in #7547..\r\n\r\n> > If it exists, the coordinator compares the compactionPartitionsSpec with the partitionsSpec in auto compaction configuration. The segment will be a compaction candidate if it has a different partitionsSpec.\r\n> \r\n> or else auto/minor compaction would produce exactly same result because it doesn't change segmentGranularity... right ?\r\n\r\nYou mean if the compaction task has the exactly same tuningConfig? Then I think yes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/535288014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/535314971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7066#issuecomment-535314971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7066","id":535314971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTMxNDk3MQ==","user":{"login":"QiuMM","id":15156517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15156517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM","html_url":"https://github.com/QiuMM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QiuMM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T03:18:16Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T03:19:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oops, I have forgotten this, sorry.

I think confusion arises because there is no trace of major/minor compaction in the code. Do you think it makes sense to create two new classes , `MajorCompactionTask` and `MinorCompactionTask` , both extend `CompactionTask` but automatically have conditions/restrictions, you noted, taken care of . Then it will be very easy to see from code what type of compaction is happening in a certain situation.\r\n\r\nI totally recognize the need for major compaction as ,I think, minor compaction is limited to compact segments in same partition set (i.e. segments with same dataSource, interval and version)

point! I just checked `IndexTuningConfig` and `ParallelIndexTuningConfig` and it looks like only `partitionsSpec` and `indexSpec` can change the result. `forceGuaranteedRollup` can also change the result but it requires to use `HashedPartitionsSpec` or `SingleDimensionPartitionsSpec`. (Perhaps we can just remove `forceGuaranteedRollup` and use only `partitionsSpec`.) It means, probably `indexSpec` also needs to be stored for stateful auto compaction.\r\n\r\n> Thanks for clarifications around major/minor compaction. I think confusion arises because there is no trace of major/minor compaction in the code. Do you think it makes sense to create two new classes , `MajorCompactionTask` and `MinorCompactionTask` , both extend `CompactionTask` but automatically have conditions/restrictions, you noted, taken care of . Then it will be very easy to see from code what type of compaction is happening in a certain situation.\r\n\r\nHmm, yes it sounds good to me. For now, `MinorCompactionTask` needs to use `DynamicPartitionsSpec` in tuningConfig and `forceTimeChunkLock = false` in its context (I forgot to mention the task context thing earlier). But in the future, I think it might be useful to support all kinds of partitionsSpec for minor compaction as well. Like, you may want to do range-based partitioning for published segments while new stream data is coming into the same time chunk to take advantage of the segment pruning at query time.\r\n\r\n> I totally recognize the need for major compaction as ,I think, minor compaction is limited to compact segments in same partition set (i.e. segments with same dataSource, interval and version) only.\r\n\r\nThat's also correct. Minor compaction can compact only the segments in the same time chunk.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/535794960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/535796161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8573#issuecomment-535796161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8573","id":535796161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTc5NjE2MQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T05:45:36Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T05:45:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> i.e. user can explicitly run `CompactionTask` with any partitionSpec .

I am noticing something like that on a cluster running loads of single phase parallel tasks, not entirely sure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/537231350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/537246321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8418#issuecomment-537246321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8418","id":537246321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzI0NjMyMQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T21:46:55Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T21:46:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing as solved, please reopen if I missed something","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/537246321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/537248185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8321#issuecomment-537248185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8321","id":537248185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzI0ODE4NQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T21:51:06Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T21:51:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you please post your ingestion spec and overlord logs?

The iterators returned by `RoundRobinStorageLocationSelectorStrategy.getLocations()` doesn't share the iteration state. Instead, they start with a different `startIndex` which is changed in a round robin fashion whenever `RoundRobinStorageLocationSelectorStrategy.getLocations()` is called.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot @jihoonson for catching this. The alternate you have suggested fixes this issue. However one caveat is when there is only a single thread loading segments it takes a different `startIndex` after every call to `RoundRobinStorageLocationSelectorStrategy.getLocations()` and the overall order of picking the locations (assuming no location is broken) will not be truly round robin as mentioned in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8038#discussion_r328927992. However I don't have any alternative approach at this moment.
