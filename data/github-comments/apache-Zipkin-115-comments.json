@jorgheymans.  Not really housekeeping of ES storage as such.  As in, it wouldn't be to find out what can be deleted from ES.  More to confirm no unexpected/stray tracing by services/components.  E.g. to find services/components that are producing more traces than you would expect which could be due to things like: \r\n\r\n1. A service/component has its sample rate/probability set too high\r\n2. A bug that is causing a service/component to generate too many traces/spans for some reason - e.g. recording the same thing multiple times or has is using too fine grained spans\r\n\r\nHaving written the above, it would probably be useful for the Zipkin API to return both i) number of traces instigated by each service/component (where that service/component appears at the root of those traces) and ii) number of spans recorded by each service/component.  \r\n\r\nBased on what the API showed, outcomes would be things like: \r\n\r\n1. Increasing ES storage capacity as we need to store more genuine traces/spans\r\n2. Decreasing sample rates/probabilities\r\n3. Fixing technical issues causing errant traces/spans","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/814375045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/817329290","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1501#issuecomment-817329290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1501","id":817329290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzMyOTI5MA==","user":{"login":"swiatkol","id":15417529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE3NTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15417529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol","html_url":"https://github.com/swiatkol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swiatkol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-11T15:53:30Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T15:53:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I had a similar issue with Ubuntu. zipkin-lens/index.html was not present in compiler resources.\r\nI tried `./mvnw -DskipTests --also-make -pl zipkin-server clean install` and then run ZipkinServer from IntelliJ but it didn't work.\r\nI needed to clear the cache by removing `~/.cache/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2020.3` folder (the \"Invalidate cache and restart\" option didn't work either).\r\nI know it wasn't on Windows but hope it helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/817329290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/819444366","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3348#issuecomment-819444366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3348","id":819444366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTQ0NDM2Ng==","user":{"login":"jcchavezs","id":3075074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzUwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3075074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs","html_url":"https://github.com/jcchavezs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-14T11:24:53Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T11:24:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tacigar I think it looks much simpler and clean, however I am concerned the annotations can't be seen in context as timestamp is less meaningful than seeing them over the span duration.

I've used Helm block comments (`{{- /* ... */ }}`) where possible, as the license applies to the templates and not to the generated manifests. I suspect the test does not like that. Although `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` contain simple YAML-comments (as they are not templated) and also make the test angry. Does the test work at all for YAML?

We usually start troubleshooting by asking users to check `/info` for the Zipkin version. Then, once we're all sure of the Zipkin version, we can ask them to check env and configprops to see what properties are actually applied vs what a user expects is applied. And if some configuration is not activating even though the properties are available, we can ask users to check `conditions` for auto-config conditions explaining why a configuration condition was or was not met. It can save a lot of time and back-and-forth to see at runtime what the configuration is and why, rather than guessing based on limited information provided.\r\n\r\nThat all said, we only officially support the endpoints mentioned at https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server#endpoints, and as I mentioned in my prior review comment, the actuator exposure property does not affect any of those endpoints because Zipkin serves them outside Actuator.\r\n\r\nWe could have Actuator off by default and ask users to turn it on to troubleshoot. It's an additional hurdle to getting to resolution during troubleshooting, though. And as others have mentioned, ALL Zipkin endpoints are unsecured since it should be protected by external means. Any user with access to the network can use any of the APIs for any purpose. See https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/782 about securing acess to the Zipkin Server. Heapdump is an extreme example since configured credentials (for example, storage credentials) could potentially be leaked to even an internal users that shouldn't directly have them. Not that you should probably use storage or storage credentials for Zipkin that is used for anything business-critical. Generally, if you're concerned about someone having access to Actuator endpoints, you should be equally concerned about them having access to the Zipkin API and doing nefarious things with those.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I'm fine disabling all of Actuator by default, but it is a breaking change in a sense - granted, it is functionality we never officially supported, but it's been there and used in troubleshooting for quite a long time. For support's sake, some documentation on how to enable those endpoints for troubleshooting will probably be important to point users at.\r\n\r\nTo recap, info/health/metrics/prometheus are officially supported endpoints and do not rely on Actuator. Whether we disable Actuator or not, they will continue to be exposed. I'm fine disabling Actuator by default, but it may negatively impact support. It's better to use `management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=false` rather than exposure, since it will avoid creating the endpoints at all in the application context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/946616291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/950988081","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3378#issuecomment-950988081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3378","id":950988081,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc44ru0x","user":{"login":"jcchavezs","id":3075074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzUwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3075074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs","html_url":"https://github.com/jcchavezs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T14:29:17Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T14:31:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jonkerj could we avoid that folder to move on? cc @basvanbeek ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/950988081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/951324108","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3384#issuecomment-951324108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3384","id":951324108,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc44tA3M","user":{"login":"BbolroC","id":6759608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTk2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6759608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC","html_url":"https://github.com/BbolroC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BbolroC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T20:57:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T21:27:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am currently struggling with local test on a `amd64` machine.
