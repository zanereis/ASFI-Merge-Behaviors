I ran into this as well where we have some high-frequency data on one end and it skews the shadow shown in the dataZoom. The dataZoom seems to be spacing all the points at regular intervals rather than according to their x-values. Is there a way to get the dataZoom to honor the x values that I can use today or is there a plan to address this in the future?
