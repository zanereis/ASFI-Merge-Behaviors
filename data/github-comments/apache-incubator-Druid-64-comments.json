Neither what I am proposing here nor #2433 unlock any functionality that is otherwise impossible to achieve. \n\nLook at this through the eyes of a new Druid user: the JS post agg getting unfinalized values is simply useless. There is literally no scenario where you would want that.\n\nConsider:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"queryType\": \"timeseries\",\n  \"dataSource\": \"wikipedia\",\n  \"granularity\": \"all\",\n  \"intervals\": [\n    \"2016-02-01/2016-02-05\"\n  ],\n  \"aggregations\": [\n    {\n      \"fieldNames\": [\n        \"page\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"NumPages\",\n      \"type\": \"cardinality\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"postAggregations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"javascript\",\n      \"name\": \"NumPagesMod1337\",\n      \"fieldNames\": [\n        \"NumPages\"\n      ],\n      \"function\": \"function(NumPages) { return typeof NumPages === 'number' }\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIt gives back: \n\n``` json\n{\n  \"error\" : \"Invalid JavaScript value of type io.druid.query.aggregation.hyperloglog.HLLCV1 (fn#1)\"\n}\n```\n\n`NumPages` in being passed in a way that can not even be used by the JS language.\n\nAs such it would be an improvement to the **usability** of the Druid query API if the inputs to a JS port agg were auto finalized for you. That is what my issue is about at it's core.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182584376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/182584971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2429#issuecomment-182584971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2429","id":182584971,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjU4NDk3MQ==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T21:16:47Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T21:16:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:

I am not so familiar with Graphite, can you confirm that the Graphite emitter is intended to be used in conjunction with the carbon aggregator on the Graphite side.  I.e. if you send metrics like \"query.time.{datasource}.{type}\" but leave off all the other dimensions, you then use Graphite's Carbon Aggregator to produce an average of points with this prefix.  Is this correct? The dimension selection going on in the GraphiteEmitter makes a lot of sense in this context.

Sorry, I'm not involved with the project (though tempted), but find it very relevant for the purposes of a product I'm involved with.\n\nMy take on the \"beta\" label (before contacting the author) - it seems further ahead of any other embeddable solution I'm aware of. Its testing seems sound and API well thought out. I can see how Java 8 can be a deal breaker, but if Druid makes that step (which I'm sure can be further leveraged) then I would at the very least favor embedding it rather than implementing it from scratch. I think any investment in closing gaps found in its implementation would be dwarfed by the investment it would take to write it from scratch and then perfecting that implementation, not to mention the benefit to the community.\n\nAre you considering making this layer pluggable, so that leader election could fallback on an embedded implementation but otherwise could be configured to use ZK, etcd, Serf etc?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/183525375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/183537205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2312#issuecomment-183537205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2312","id":183537205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzUzNzIwNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-13T00:06:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-13T00:06:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@liqweed agree that Copycat does seem the farthest along of any embeddable JVM consensus system, I would love to hear if anyone has run it in production long enough to see if it can match ZK in reliability (ZK's record is not perfect but it's pretty good).\n\nI'm not sure about other folks, but I was not really imagining this layer being pluggable, as that seems like more trouble than it's worth. I think in the long run we could merge the consensus system and the metadata store and have something that people are generally happy with and don't feel the need to plug in other
