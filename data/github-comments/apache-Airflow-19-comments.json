@timeisapear and @mistercrunch,\n\nI believe @thoralf-gutierrez and myself have found an easy way to reproduce this issue as part as the unit tests. \n\nWe created a small \"end-to-end dag tester\" that rely on a `BackFillJob` to execute a DAG and then validates some post-conditions. We believe this is already super useful now and can grow into a great tool that continuously validates the robustness of Airflow! The corresponding PR together with some examples of sucessfull tests is here: https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/670.\n\nWe used this framework to test the trigger rules ALL_FAILED, ALL_DONE and ONE_FAILED (when executed in a `BackFillJob`) and noted that none of them trigger the execution of the corresponding task since the `BackFillJob` systematically removes it from the `tasks_to_run` list, in the code identified by @timeisapear [above](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/480#issuecomment-145597830). \n\nWe're not submitting these 3 tests in a PR yet since they would break the build, though the code and the corresponding Travis build failure on our fork are visible below: \n\nhttps://github.com/RealImpactAnalytics/airflow/tree/testing_trigger_rules_v3\nhttps://travis-ci.org/RealImpactAnalytics/airflow/jobs/94600932\n\nWe suggest the following resolution path: \n\n1) please review https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/670 and let us know if there's anything more we should do in order to have this validation framework included the master branch \n\n2) we could then submit another PR with the 3 supplementary tests above + a fix that, as suggested by @timeisapear, would simply allow downstream tasks to stay in the `tasks_to_run` list if they can be triggered by failures. \n\nWhat do you think ?
