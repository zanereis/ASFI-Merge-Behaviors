In my test, I use CopyFromTo() to convert fp16 to fp32 before the send_buf push to ps-lite and convert fp32 to fp16 after receive the recv_buf from ps-lite.\r\n\r\nThe code was as below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Push_(...){\r\n...\r\n...\r\nif (merged.ctx().dev_mask() == cpu::kDevMask) {\r\n        // make sure the previous push/pull is completed\r\n        send_buf.WaitToWrite();\r\n        //when \r\n        if (send_buf.is_none()) {\r\n          if (storage_type == kDefaultStorage) {\r\n            send_buf = NDArray(merged.shape(), pinned_ctx_, true, mshadow::DataType<real_t>::kFlag);\r\n          } else {\r\n            send_buf = NDArray(storage_type, merged.shape(), pinned_ctx_, true, mshadow::DataType<real_t>::kFlag);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        CopyFromTo(merged, &send_buf);\r\n\r\n        //send_buf = merged;  // avoid memory copy\r\n      } else {\r\n        if (send_buf.is_none()) {\r\n          if (storage_type == kDefaultStorage) {\r\n            send_buf = NDArray(merged.shape(), pinned_ctx_, true, mshadow::DataType<real_t>::kFlag);\r\n          } else {\r\n            send_buf = NDArray(storage_type, merged.shape(), pinned_ctx_, true, mshadow::DataType<real_t>::kFlag);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        if (merged.dtype() == mshadow::DataType<real_t>::kFlag) {\r\n          CopyFromTo(merged, &send_buf);\r\n        } else {\r\n          //It can't convert from fp16 to fp32 across device. So I use to step CopyFromTo().\r\n          NDArray tmp = NDArray(merged.shape(), pinned_ctx_, true, merged.dtype());\r\n          CopyFromTo(merged, &tmp);\r\n          CopyFromTo(tmp, &send_buf);\r\n        }\r\n        //CopyFromTo(merged, &send_buf);\r\n      }\r\n      // push to servers\r\n      if (storage_type == kDefaultStorage) {\r\n      auto push_to_servers =\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid PullImpl(..){\r\n...\r\nCHECK_NOTNULL(Engine::Get())->PushAsync(\r\n          pull_from_servers,\r\n          pinned_ctx_,\r\n          {},\r\n          {recv_buf.var()},\r\n          FnProperty::kNormal,\r\n          priority,\r\n          PROFILER_MESSAGE(\"KVStoreDistDefaultPull\"));\r\n      if (grouped_vals[i][0]->dtype() != mshadow::DataType<real_t>::kFlag) {\r\n        NDArray tmp = NDArray(grouped_vals[i][0]->shape(), pinned_ctx_,true, grouped_vals[i][0]->dtype());\r\n        CopyFromTo(recv_buf, &tmp, 0);\r\n        comm_->Broadcast(key, tmp, grouped_vals[i], priority);\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        comm_->Broadcast(key, recv_buf, grouped_vals[i], priority);\r\n      }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. This can solve the problem #7554, and make the problem in init mentioned before more obviously.\r\n4. In this change, I can run distribute training with fp16 correctly. Does MXNet need this feature?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330719121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330732609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7957#issuecomment-330732609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7957","id":330732609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDczMjYwOQ==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-20T03:07:52Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T03:07:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@qingzhouzhen thanks for the contribution.

run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330856403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330878891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7967#issuecomment-330878891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7967","id":330878891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDg3ODg5MQ==","user":{"login":"fhieber","id":2027990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjc5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2027990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber","html_url":"https://github.com/fhieber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-20T14:58:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T14:58:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tdomhan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330878891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330887561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7927#issuecomment-330887561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7927","id":330887561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDg4NzU2MQ==","user":{"login":"traveller59","id":28866047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODY2MDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28866047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59","html_url":"https://github.com/traveller59","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/traveller59/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-20T15:25:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T15:25:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks,

So I am quite sure that MXNet is functioning.\r\n\r\nTo save some time for others who might want to install MXNet on a Raspberry Pi, I will summarize what I had to do to make things work:\r\n1. My MXNet installation was done on Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian stretch and I followed the installation at https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/get_started/install.html with \"Devices\" and \"Raspberry Pi\" selected.\r\n2. For dependencies, I had to add installing the cblas package:\r\n` sudo apt-get install libcblas*`\r\n3. Run make and ignore the error at the end of the make `Makefile:344: recipe for target 'bin/im2rec' failed`. Pease check the mxnet/lib folder to make sure that the libmxnet.so has been generated.\r\n4. Install the python binding with sudo:\r\n`cd python\r\nsudo pip install --upgrade pip\r\nsudo pip install -e .`\r\n\r\nI will not close this issue yet since there are still questions about what the makefile is supposed to be doing at and after line #439. I will leave it up to someone who knows the makefile to answer the question and close this issue. Hope this makes sense.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your valuable comments and support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330896157/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330904210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7960#issuecomment-330904210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7960","id":330904210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDkwNDIxMA==","user":{"login":"zjost","id":9660566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjA1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9660566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost","html_url":"https://github.com/zjost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-20T16:17:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T16:17:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't get a stack trace, the Jupyter notebook kernel crashes.
