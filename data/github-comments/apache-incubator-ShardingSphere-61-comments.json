We design ShardingSphere should be a complete database for application. The SQL is the command and basis which let database execute. When SQL miss sharding column, the sharding values should be empty and shardingSphere should do full-routing when sharding values is empty. No database will callback a custom algorithm when sharding values is empty.\r\n\r\n2. For almost users, maybe 99%, they implement their algorithm with a premise that `shardingValues` is not empty. This change may cause program exceptions and users' confusion.\r\n\r\nSo we can't merge this PR to main branch.\r\n\r\nI think `SQL examine` @terrymanu said in #2826 may be a better way to implement this. We look forward to your more PR on `SQL examine` features.\r\n\r\nBTW, If you really want to achieve like this, you can fork a branch to do.

From what I understand, letting `ShardingStrategy` decide what to do if `shardingValues` is empty or not contradicts the design of ShardingSphere.\r\n\r\nReferring back to the sql examine feature, can you please explain a bit more in detail on what are you guys planning in that feature. Would want to understand if that helps my use case or not. \r\n\r\nMentioning my use case again, I need some way to override the behaviour of full-routing when no sharding column is there in the SQL.

depends on java.sql.Connection to complete, the XA transaction is completely independent of the java.sql.Connection. It may be not appropriate to control the XA transaction through the java.sql.Connection, i think the TM is more suitable. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, this scenario involves two different xa transactions, they get two different Connections, except share the same thread context, there is no association between them. To support the REQUIRES_NEW transaction propagation, simply forwarding the enlistResource operation to the TM is sufficient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/521117569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/521117860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2477#issuecomment-521117860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2477","id":521117860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTExNzg2MA==","user":{"login":"liujuntao","id":13896760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk2NzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13896760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao","html_url":"https://github.com/liujuntao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujuntao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T06:24:05Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T06:24:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When
