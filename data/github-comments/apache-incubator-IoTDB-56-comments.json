think the following syntax conventions should be followed in JAVA API:\r\n\r\n- For **IoTDB-SQL interface** , such as `executeQueryStatement` and `executeNonQueryStatement`: The input SQL parameter needs to conform to the [syntax conventions](https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/UserGuide/V0.13.x/Reference/Syntax-Conventions.html) and be escaped for JAVA strings. For example, you need to add a backslash before the double-quotes. (That is: after JAVA escaping, it is consistent with the SQL statement executed on the command line.)\r\n- For **Other interfaces** :\r\n  - The node names in path or path prefix as parameter:\r\n    - The node names which should be escaped by backticks (`) in the SQL statement, and escaping is not required here.\r\n    - The node names enclosed in single or double quotes still need to be enclosed in single or double quotes and must be escaped for JAVA strings.\r\n    - For the `checkTimeseriesExists` interface, since the IoTDB-SQL interface is called internally, the time-series pathname must be consistent with the SQL syntax conventions and be escaped for JAVA strings.\r\n  - Identifiers (such as template names) as parameters: The identifiers which should be escaped by backticks (`) in the SQL statement, and escaping is not required here.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

Hi,\r\n> \r\n> I think the following syntax conventions should be followed in JAVA API:\r\n> \r\n> * For **IoTDB-SQL interface** , such as `executeQueryStatement` and `executeNonQueryStatement`: The input SQL parameter needs to conform to the [syntax conventions](https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/UserGuide/V0.13.x/Reference/Syntax-Conventions.html) and be escaped for JAVA strings. For example, you need to add a backslash before the double-quotes. (That is: after JAVA escaping, it is consistent with the SQL statement executed on the command line.)\r\n> * For **Other interfaces** :\r\n>   \r\n>   * The node names in path or path prefix as parameter:\r\n>     \r\n>     * The node names which should be escaped by backticks (`) in the SQL statement, and escaping is not required here.\r\n>     * The node names enclosed in single or double quotes still need to be enclosed in single or double quotes and must be escaped for JAVA strings.\r\n>     * For the `checkTimeseriesExists` interface, since the IoTDB-SQL interface is called internally, the time-series pathname must be consistent with the SQL syntax conventions and be escaped for JAVA strings.\r\n>   * Identifiers (such as template names) as parameters: The identifiers which should be escaped by backticks (`) in the SQL statement, and escaping is not required here.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think? Welcome to discuss if you have any concerns or ideas!\r\n\r\nCan these problems be avoided by following some simple rules? \r\n\r\n1.  Use backticks (`) only in **IoTDB-SQL** interface, checkTimeseriesExists will cause confusion\r\n2. Or add suffix to **other interface** methods that use backticks (`).

 \r\n\r\n> For the checkTimeseriesExists interface, since the IoTDB-SQL interface is called internally, the time-series pathname must be consistent with the SQL syntax conventions and be escaped for JAVA strings.\r\n\r\nThis may cause some potential bugs: can we make sure all callers know the semantic?\r\n\r\nFor example, if someone implement a new Java interface like `createTimeseries`, and in the implementation, he/she calls `checkTimeseriesExists`... (Don't we call `checkTimeseriesExists` in our `createTimeseries` method?)\r\n\r\nConsidering the above, I think adding a new function `checkTimeseriesExistsWithSQL ` may be fine. @coolbeevip
