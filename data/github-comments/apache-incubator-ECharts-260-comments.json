你好，没太明白你的需求，能详细描述下需要这样做的背景么？\r\n\r\n不是背景，我的页面上有个导出按钮，导出数据的同时要把图表也导出到文件中。\r\n目前我的做法是把图片已Base64形式传回API端，然后生成到文件中。\r\n\r\n但是，页面上是分数据视图和图表视图切换的，当数据视图时，也可以执行导出。\r\n此时，图表处于Display:

To do this, I am using a graph DB ([ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/)) to store the data. This DB, like other graphs DBs, stores the data into nodes and links structure, similar to Echarts graph data structure. I want to continue using this data structure instead of parsing the data and creates a new one following the parent -> children structure that the tree chart type requires. I think it is extra logic that is not necessary and even it could have better performance if Echarts has this layout instead of calculating the node coordinates by myself.\r\n\r\nThe library (vis.js), that I have told above, has this feature to configure the graph in a hierarchy layout and even it has the possibility to configure the space between nodes, either horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if Echarts had similar features for its graph chart type as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/579280757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/579327746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/5159#issuecomment-579327746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/5159","id":579327746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTMyNzc0Ng==","user":{"login":"zhxulin","id":16347999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ3OTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16347999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin","html_url":"https://github.com/zhxulin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxulin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T16:12:05Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T16:12:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"需要设置inRange","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/579327746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/579406934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12049#issuecomment-579406934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12049","id":579406934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTQwNjkzNA==","user":{"login":"borodovisin","id":26287838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Mjg3ODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26287838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin","html_url":"https://github.com/borodovisin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodovisin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-28T19:10:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-28T19:10:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @Ovilia.
