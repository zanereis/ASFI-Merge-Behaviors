This eliminates duplicate commits and makes history nice and clean.\n\nThis pull request #2, is not a merge forward of the commits from #1, and is unusable if we follow those conventions. It'd be better to merge forward, resolve the conflicts, and submit that as a pull request for 1.5, and then similarly initiate a pull request to master after merging forward to master (effectively a no-op since the commits were cherry-picked from master, but it preserves a common history).\n\nThat said, I'm not sure this fix warrants backporting, as it's not a bugfix, but introduces potential bugs in important code that that we'd hate to break. The additional maintenance and testing costs are probably not worth the risk.\n\nAdditional discussion can be found at

Here's an example of what I've done (by modifying the WholeRowIterator). Assume a table that contains 'documents' and various document information. Assume a table format like this (format: `<row <cf : cq>> = value`):\n\n```\n<docid1 <META : timestamp>> (long) 12345\n<docid1 <META : meta_field_1>> (String) metaFieldValue1\n<docid1 <META : meta_field_2>> (String) metaFieldValue2\n<docid2 <META : timestamp>>  (long) 23456\n```\n\nFor other reasons in the system, I have a protocol buffer definition that can be used for shipping this data around. It's definition looks like this:\n\n```\nmessage DocumentMessage {\n    optional int64 timestamp = 1;\n    optional string meta_field_1 = 2;\n    optional string meta_field_2 = 3;\n}\n```\n\nI can define an iterator that is passed a generated protocol buffer class that can iterate over the whole row and automatically build the protocol buffer object. getTopValue() now returns a protocol buffer message that the application knows how to parse.\n\nThis is nice for bulk loading and saves the client from having to build the message it would have had to build anyway. When iterating over the results returned by the scanner, an entire document at a time is returned instead of individual columns.\n\nI can provide a more concrete example/implementation of such a class if you'd like.\n\nThe Iterator I have defined which extends the proposed RowEncodingIterator is setup as follows:\n\n``` java\nIteratorSetting is = new IteratorSetting(1, MessageLoadingIterator.class);\nMessageLoadingIterator.setMessageClass(is, \"com.yourproject.PbDocument$DocumentMessage\");\nMessageLoadingIterator.addLexicoderClass(is, String.class, \"org.apache.accumulo.core.client.lexicoder.StringLexicoder\");\nMessageLoadingIterator.addLexicoderClass(is, Long.class, \"org.apache.accumulo.core.client.lexicoder.LongLexicoder\");\nMessageLoadingIterator.addLexicoderClass(is, DifferentProtobufMessage.class,\n                                         \"com.yourproject.lexicoder.DifferentProtobufLexicoder\");\n```\n\nand will automatically build a message of the type specified by 'setMessageClass', and will be able to parse any value for which a Lexicoder is defined (It uses the type specified by the protocol buffer message to parse the values in the accumulo table). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/43555087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/43654266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/7#issuecomment-43654266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/7","id":43654266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjU0MjY2","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-20T17:00:26Z","updated_at":"2014-05-20T17:00:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cool, I think that helps a lot.

I agree that because the client may recover from the is strictly not an error case, however I feel it is good to have breadcrumbs available when trying to track down problems. In my specific case we run into some really slow scans/writes and I don't know what the root cause is because I am not logging at debug level. I look at the monitor UI and Accumulo is humming along but then have to bump the client side log level in order to see that the first attempt fails on every scan but the second attempt works just fine. \nI find that the client side logging of first attempt failures at warn level, as opposed to debug, to be very helpful because it allows our monitoring tools to alert our administrators that our application may be having connectivity issues. That allows them the ability to write reports and see how often these failures occur and potentially track down the root cause. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/62402671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/62410025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/18#issuecomment-62410025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/18","id":62410025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDEwMDI1","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-10T16:26:10Z","updated_at":"2014-11-10T16:26:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's a good point too.

fixed up the patch from Keith's comments. This one looks good.\n\nMy mistake starting out with the patch was trying to change _every_ location where an empty tablet could be disregarded during compaction.  Now the current patch has the _minimal_ changes necessary to make empty tablets compact.  The biggest one is the change to the default compaction strategy.  As before, I'm open for ideas to test further.  I think we're closing in on good code.\n\nTo answer the question I posed previously, the expected behavior when a major compaction iterator throws and exception (e.g. [BadIterator](https://accumulo.apache.org/1.6/apidocs/org/apache/accumulo/test/functional/BadIterator.html)) \nis that the tablet server will fail the compaction, not updating the metadata table, and then retry the compaction.  If the error is permanent, then the compaction will fail again and again continuously.  The only way to stop the cycle is to cancel the compaction manually.  This patch maintains this behavior.\n\nRebased the commits to master.
