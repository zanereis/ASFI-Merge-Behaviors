Actually, you should set \"use_global_stats: true\" in prototxt of Caffe and write \"model.bind(for_training=False,data_shapes=[('data', tuple(input_dim))])\" in your own mxnet test script(not the convert_model.py). As a result, Both Caffe and mxnet can use the constant BatchNorm momentums learned in the previous training stage(not the momentums calculated by the input image) in a inference case. I want to know how do you write your test code ?\r\nAnother key point is that the Caffe use BGR inputs but the mxnet use RGB inputs, you also need to swap the rgb planes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/308934559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/308943688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6271#issuecomment-308943688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6271","id":308943688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODk0MzY4OA==","user":{"login":"HQ01","id":25813433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODEzNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25813433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01","html_url":"https://github.com/HQ01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HQ01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T06:22:37Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T06:22:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yuconglin Yeah I simply re-installed it and it worked.

Thanks for your help. Really appreciate it. Please check the attached test codes.\r\n[test.txt](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/files/1081577/test.txt)\r\nThe forward steps are conducted from L77 - L93. \r\n\r\nI set \"use_global_stats: true\" in prototxt in caffe. But I am not sure the momentums you mentioned are correctly used in my mxnet. I also change BGR to RGB, which makes the mxnet inference similar to caffe inference, with slightly worse results.\r\n\r\nFYI, I wonder if the current mxnet convert_symbol.py is the same as what you use in the past.    I check L184-L193 convert_symbol.py (https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/tools/caffe_converter/convert_symbol.py), the program has already change epsilon to 1e-4 if eps <=1e-5 as follows.\r\n\r\nif layer.type == 'BatchNorm':\r\ntype_string = 'mx.symbol.BatchNorm'\r\nparam = layer.batch_norm_param\r\n% CuDNN requires eps to be greater than 1e-05\r\n% We compensate for this change in convert_model\r\nepsilon = param.eps\r\nif (epsilon <= 1e-05):\r\n    epsilon = 1e-04\r\nparam_string = 'use_global_stats=%s, fix_gamma=False, eps=%f' % (\r\nparam.use_global_stats, epsilon)\r\n\r\nThere might be other details that are different from previous version in caffe_converter (https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/tools/caffe_converter). I am not sure if there are something else need to be modified. Would you please kindly share the caffe_converter you used.
