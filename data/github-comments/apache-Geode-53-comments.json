I didn't look at all of them. But it should have only changed 2 or 3.\r\n> I'm not sure I like this change because now we have the parameters in two places. We still have the switch statement in InfoExecutor that checks for each one, but now we also have a list of them in another place (ALLOWED_INFO_COMMANDS). The other confusing thing is that the INFO command does allow other keywords it just ignores them. In native redis \"INFO foobar\" does not give an error but just returns nothing. But by adding a RestrictedInputValuesParameterRequirements to INFO it makes me think that any other params would cause an error.\r\n\r\nOK-  SO I finally see your point about what INFO returns.  You are correct, there shouldn't be an error.  A false pass for an integration test was making me think that this was working correctly (that the error was being caught and only the error mesg was being returned to the end user). But that's not the case.  To your point, this should not be used for the info command then.

But from the viewpoint of readAck, it currently calls readHeader and readMessage or readChunk. All these methods end up synchronizing to protect the buffer. If that sync is needed then it is also needed at the readAck level. readAck is incorrect to allow another thread to modify the buffer between the readHeader and readMessage calls. It is hard to prove that no other threads could concurrently modify the buffer which is why I think we added the new ioFilter.getSynchObject.

The gateway senders would use the value of hostname-for-senders to connect to the receivers but we should have \"something\" (the load balancer in the real world) that should intercept the connect call to the hostname-for-senders address so that the connection is finally made against the ip addresses to which the receivers binded.\r\nI do not know if we can tweak in the test case the part of the creation of the connection in the gateway sender so that when a connection to an endpoint is created, the IP address to be used is changed to one of the IP addresses on which the receivers are listening.\r\nI will try to check if this is possible.\r\nAny ideas are welcome.\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/717506887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/717534797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5670#issuecomment-717534797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5670","id":717534797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzUzNDc5Nw==","user":{"login":"kohlmu-pivotal","id":11528691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI4Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/kohlmu-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T20:57:45Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T20:57:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@albertogpz some engineers pointed me at `DualServerSNIAcceptanceTest` to possibly be a template to help with testing this.\r\nI will admit I'm not across anything done in this test, maybe @Bill could provide some guidance if you have more questions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/717534797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/717537364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5670#issuecomment-717537364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5670","id":717537364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzUzNzM2NA==","user":{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T21:02:31Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T21:02:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @albertogpz some engineers pointed me at `DualServerSNIAcceptanceTest` to possibly be a template to help with testing this.\r\n> I will admit I'm not across anything done in this test, maybe @Bill could provide some guidance if you have more questions\r\n\r\n@kohlmu-pivotal Great, thanks!

Mostly around `keyspaceHits` and `keyspaceMisses`. Do we want to count those in the same way Redis does? One potential use case/argument for counting them the way Redis does is that a user might want to know how many times they tried to read something that wasn't in the database (it wouldn't really matter if they did a `SADD`, `SET`, or some other create operation and the key was null, for example, because it just gets added if it's not there).

How hard would it be to use docker-compose in a distributedTest? I am saying it because I used in my test the org.apache.geode.test.dunit.VM class.

@DonalEvans Do you have any capacity to assist with this?\r\n\r\nI emailed back and forth with Mario a bit trying to figure out a way to reproduce the issue in a DUnit test, but it's not an area of the code I'm particularly familiar with so my ability to help was fairly limited. I thought that if the assumption that the problem was caused by colocation taking too long was correct, then artificially slowing down colocation by using a listener to wait a little after each bucket is created could reproduce it.\r\n\r\nSince part of the proposed fix seems to be to wait a total of 9000ms for colocation to complete in `CreateMIssingBucketTask.java`, it seems like forcing colocation to take close to that long should be a sure-fire way to reproduce the issue, if the fix is effective. It seems like this wasn't the case though, so maybe my idea was off the mark.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/721882594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/722021982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5637#issuecomment-722021982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5637","id":722021982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjAyMTk4Mg==","user":{"login":"jchen21","id":11181423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgxNDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11181423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T23:04:40Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T23:04:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/722021982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/722075908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5658#issuecomment-722075908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5658","id":722075908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjA3NTkwOA==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-05T01:56:24Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T01:56:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 3 alerts** and **fixes 1** when merging 19b1313d9d31dc3320e5659555649133e991db13 into 7367d17e3817fc41666d471c5eb4d0df0d33c18b - [view on LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/geode/rev/pr-1bf6e8475bff02a5fe107ea9ef2ef16a37961649)\n\n**new alerts:**\n\n* 2 for Potential input resource leak\n* 1 for Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm\n\n**fixed alerts:**\n\n* 1 for Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/722075908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
