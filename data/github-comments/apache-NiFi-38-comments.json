That really would be preferred, as they are both very stable libraries and much more \"robust\"/feature-rich than what we have here. Unfortunately, though, because of the way that their readers/writers work, using those would have required some pretty intense refactoring of some of the core repository code. This is largely due to the API that was created for the repository wasn't thought through well enough. For example, the RecordWriter has a `writeRecord` method that takes in a record write as well as the OutputStream to write to. The repository itself may write to the OutputStream in between records. These libraries wouldn't really support that well. So rather than rewrite some of the most critical parts of NiFi, I elected to create a much simpler schema-based reader/writer approach. It may make sense at some point to review this decision though and refactor the repositories to make them more amenable to this type of thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/260339966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/260348862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1207#issuecomment-260348862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1207","id":260348862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDM0ODg2Mg==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-14T14:29:43Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T14:29:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

That is the same pattern Storm and Spark integration does.\nI agree that third parties have been using SiteToSiteClient, but I don't think many of them re-implement SiteToSiteClient actual implementation, rather they just use the library. When they use it just to use SiteToSite protocol, the URL is what they configured by themselves. So it should be fine. It doesn't break anything.\n\nFor the case if a third party actually re-implementing a SiteToSiteClient to customize it at lower level, excuse me, the comment you concerned about was misleading. The interface hasn't been changed at all. What has changed by this PR is the behavior of one implementation of SiteToSiteClient, that is the NiFi default implementation, i.e. SocketClient and HttpClient. I didn't have to change the comment in the first place. It doesn't break any other SiteToSiteClient implementations written by third parties outside of NiFi codebase.\n\nSo, to address your concern, I just removed the comment from SiteToSiteClient.java. By doing so, the file becomes identical with the previous version. So I amended the commit to keep it intact.\n\nDoes this address your concern?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261420352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261422977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1238#issuecomment-261422977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1238","id":261422977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQyMjk3Nw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T01:27:06Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T01:27:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I talked to @YolandaMDavis -- she will review and give a final yes/no and then I can merge. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261422977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261429270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1222#issuecomment-261429270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1222","id":261429270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQyOTI3MA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T02:08:19Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T02:10:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @jvwing , this is very useful!

One reason I guess is that the PR title doesn't have corresponding JIRA number, we usually look for the JIRA having 'patch available' state to review. I searched the JIRA and found [NIFI-2275](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-2275).\n\nIf NIFI-2275 is the right one, please update the PR title, and update the JIRA by clicking the 'Submit Patch' button to proceed the JIRA to patch available state.\n\nI reviewed the code briefly, though. One thing I would like you to update is the name of the new property descriptor, related comment and code. 'Partition Key' and 'Partition Id' are used inconsistent way. I think those all should be 'Partition Key'. It seems the actual partition Id will be determined by EventHubClient library by hashing the partition key.\n\nI wonder if it'd be more useful to support expression language with Partition Key, since the processor accepts incoming flow files, user may want to assign Partition Key based on flow file attributes.\n\nCurrently, PutAzureEventHub processor doesn't have Test class. I'd be happy to have one even if it only does simple property checks. It'd be a good starting point and make subsequent contribution easier.\n\nAlso, Travis build failed with an unrelated error. Please rebase the branch with the latest master so that it can pass Travis build. \n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/261433792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
