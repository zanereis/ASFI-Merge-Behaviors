The problem posed was: we currently pass buffers to operator implementation as pointers, and the pointer lifetime of those buffers is clear enough from convention (when the operator impl returns, they are invalid; so impl cannot save those pointers). if we start down the path of adding a more general reference counting impl to StorageRewrite, that implies we may be passing user data structs that contain pointers to operator implementations. however, it isn't really clear how we should explain the lifecycle of _those_ pointers.\r\n\r\nsort of I think this is a minor point given the current impl, but I also agree that if we are arguing that StorageRewrite's struct_set analysis is in fact a limited application of a general pattern, and implementing the general pattern is also fine, we do need to then elaborate where we are going with it. i do think keeping the impl in AOTExecutorCodegen doesn't carry this problem. \r\n\r\nanother possible way to alleviate both concerns would be to define an attr on the `tir.tvm_stack_alloca` node that explicitly instructs StorageRewrite to link that tvm_stack_alloca with a given AllocateNode. what do you think about that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/859919232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/859934715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8190#issuecomment-859934715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8190","id":859934715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1OTkzNDcxNQ==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-11T22:12:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T22:12:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks

apologies for the delay in reviewing this one. i'm not sure there is broad alignment yet on the way we intend to do full-graph memory planning in TVM. and, even when we do come to agreement on a model for memory (which I think may look similar to the one you're working towards here), we still need to implement support for it in both Graph and AOT executors. Also, the Graph executor is invoking TIR PrimFunc, so it's likely something similar to this PR will be useful. My thinking is that what you have here is fairly close and we'll just need to rename fields or add additional e.g. `pool_id` to give more context to the offset.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not convinced we should drop this PR; however, before proceeding, I'd like to get everyone aligned around a single memory planning proposal. There are a couple of theoretically orthogonal pieces of such a proposal as well: a) the interface between the TVM graph and the memory planner; b) the algorithm(s) used in planning; c) the interface between TVM and the executors. At present there are two suggestions for (a) a TIR-level interface and a Relay-level planner. I think the TIR-based planner offers more flexibility but the Relay one is easier to implement to (e.g. it's nearly complete in the tree today).\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in reviewing the TIR-level interface proposed in the [USMP](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-unified-static-memory-planning/10099) RFC? It would be great to get your thoughts whether it's possible to implement the algorithms you've proposed using that interface as well.\r\n\r\nGiven there is some interest from the community in doing whole-program TIR optimization, plus the AOT top-level function is in TIR, it may be slightly more impactful to adopt that interface. However, I'd like to understand whether that precludes including the algorithms you've proposed [here](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/discussion-alignment-memory-planning/9730). Finally, this PR could serve as a basis to implement the Graph executor changes required to support (c).\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/860312504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/860531571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8245#issuecomment-860531571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8245","id":860531571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDUzMTU3MQ==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T09:15:00Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T09:15:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

@areusch , \r\nAfter some thinking we came up with a different solution. The way we are doing things now is the following:\r\npass-a) Compose the `main_func` with `tvm_set_struct`, i.e., codegen ready\r\npass-b) Storage rewrite modified to take care of the structs\r\npass-c) `tvm::build`\r\n\r\nA possible alternative can be the following:\r\npass-a2) Compose the `main_func` without `tvm_set_struct`. This means that the packed calls will receive raw pointers. This in turn means that the `main_func` in TIR is not ready to be code generated\r\npass-b2) Storage rewrite without any change. This is possible now since we are not using `tvm_set_struct` yet\r\npass-c2) transform the packed calls inputs by using `tvm_set_struct`. We can actually avoid this pass if we are using unpacked signatures. \r\npass-d2) `tvm::build`\r\n\r\nWith pipilene-2 we can leave `StorageRewrite` unchanged and still address the issues that `tvm_set_struct` gives us.

@mehrdadh Hi folks, sorry for the delay on reviewing it.\r\n\r\n@mehrdadh thanks for the additional checks!\r\n\r\nI figured out why the link error pasted above happened on my local environment but not on the CI.\r\n\r\nIt happens that the CI is using Zephyr SDK 0.12 whilst I was using Zephyr SDK 0.11 and the following Zephyr SDK fix is only in 0.12:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommit 2c1077298b169c39a1badb4d4a4236a2f2eaf769\r\nAuthor: Daniel Leung <daniel.leung@intel.com>\r\nDate:   Thu Dec 10 12:27:08 2020 -0800\r\n\r\n    x86_64: fix soft float for x86 32-bit\r\n    \r\n    This fixes soft-float build for x86 32-bit (-m32 -msoft-float)\r\n    under x86_64-zephyr-elf multilib build. This now actually\r\n    includes the soft float functions.\r\n    \r\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel Leung <daniel.leung@intel.com>\r\n```\r\n\r\nhence the soft-float functions were not present in my environment, causing the linking errors when the patch in question is applied.\r\n\r\nThat, on the other hand, exposed the fact that `qemu_x86` .elf image was not really using `CONFIG_FPU=y` and that can be confirmed by looking for soft-float specific functions present (or absent) in the final .elf image when its built with Zephyr SDK 0.12 (fixed version). Hence no soft-float functions are present in the `qemu_x86` image without the patch applied:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ objdump -t ./zephyr.elf | fgrep float\r\n$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nbut are included (and used) in the .elf image when the patch is applied (for `CONFIG_FPU=y` is not kicking in):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ objdump -t ./zephyr.elf | fgrep float\r\n00000000 l    df *ABS*\t00000000 floatunsidf.c\r\n00000000 l    df *ABS*\t00000000 floatsidf.c\r\n00000000 l    df *ABS*\t00000000 soft_float_stubs.c\r\n00103020 g     F text\t0000007f .hidden __floatsidf\r\n00101dd0 g     F text\t00000084 .hidden __floatunsidf\r\n$\r\n$ objdump -t ./zephyr.elf | fgrep __subdf3\r\n001012b0 g     F text\t00000b1e .hidden __subdf3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems expected because although `CPU_HAS_FPU` is selected  in Zephyr's `boards/x86/qemu_x86/Kconfig.board` `CONFIG_FPU=y` is not set by default in Zephyr for that board. `CONFIG_FPU` depends on `CPU_HAS_FPU` to be set but setting `CPU_HAS_FPU` doesn't imply `CONFIG_FPU=y` in my understanding.\r\n\r\nThus one might think it was just a matter of enabling `CONFIG_FPU` per board, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/apps/microtvm/zephyr/host_driven/boards/qemu_x86.conf b/apps/microtvm/zephyr/host_driven/boards/qemu_x86.conf\r\nindex f314f59a5..12c67367f 100644\r\n--- a/apps/microtvm/zephyr/host_driven/boards/qemu_x86.conf\r\n+++ b/apps/microtvm/zephyr/host_driven/boards/qemu_x86.conf\r\n@@ -23,3 +23,5 @@ CONFIG_TIMER_RANDOM_GENERATOR=y\r\n \r\n # Default stack size is 1k, this is required for debug mode. \r\n CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=1536\r\n+\r\n+CONFIG_FPU=y\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever although the build will finish ok the following error will be caught by the CI when testing against models that rely on floating point operations:\r\n\r\n```\r\n____________________________________________________________________ test_byoc_utvm[host] ____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nplatform = 'host', west_cmd = 'west', skip_build = False, tvm_debug = False\r\n\r\n    def test_byoc_utvm(platform, west_cmd, skip_build, tvm_debug):\r\n        \"\"\"This is a simple test case to check BYOC capabilities of uTVM\"\"\"\r\n        model, zephyr_board = PLATFORMS[platform]\r\n        build_config = {\"skip_build\": skip_build, \"debug\": tvm_debug}\r\n        x = relay.var(\"x\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w0 = relay.var(\"w0\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w1 = relay.var(\"w1\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w2 = relay.var(\"w2\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w3 = relay.var(\"w3\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w4 = relay.var(\"w4\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w5 = relay.var(\"w5\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w6 = relay.var(\"w6\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n        w7 = relay.var(\"w7\", shape=(10, 10))\r\n    \r\n        # C compiler\r\n        z0 = relay.add(x, w0)\r\n        p0 = relay.subtract(z0, w1)\r\n        q0 = relay.multiply(p0, w2)\r\n    \r\n        z1 = relay.add(x, w3)\r\n        p1 = relay.subtract(z1, w4)\r\n        q1 = relay.multiply(p1, w5)\r\n    \r\n        # Other parts on TVM\r\n        z2 = relay.add(x, w6)\r\n        q2 = relay.subtract(z2, w7)\r\n    \r\n        r = relay.concatenate((q0, q1, q2), axis=0)\r\n        f = relay.Function([x, w0, w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7], r)\r\n        mod = tvm.IRModule()\r\n        ann = CcompilerAnnotator()\r\n        mod[\"main\"] = ann.visit(f)\r\n        mod = tvm.relay.transform.PartitionGraph()(mod)\r\n        mod = tvm.relay.transform.InferType()(mod)\r\n    \r\n        x_data = np.random.rand(10, 10).astype(\"float32\")\r\n        w_data = []\r\n        for _ in range(8):\r\n            w_data.append(np.random.rand(10, 10).astype(\"float32\"))\r\n    \r\n        map_inputs = {\"w{}\".format(i): w_data[i] for i in range(8)}\r\n        map_inputs[\"x\"] = x_data\r\n>       check_result(\r\n            relay_mod=mod,\r\n            map_inputs=map_inputs,\r\n            out_shape=(30, 10),\r\n            result=np.concatenate(\r\n                (\r\n                    ((x_data + w_data[0]) -

This bug was recently fixed by PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8230, which now allows to set `CONFIG_FPU` per board correctly.\r\n\r\nKevin, since Zephyr defaults regarding CONFIG_FPU might not be what microTVM needs (which is ok) I think we need to enabled FPU per board, for each board (@areusch  and @mehrdadh  are you ok with that?) So could you please update your patch? It also needs to be rebased since `demo_runtime` was renamed to `host_driven`.

What if the condition `if (constant_size > 0 && constant_size * nbytes < runtime::kMaxStackAlloca)` is not true, it will generate the same IR as the current main.\r\n\r\nI admit that the removal of the following optimization:\r\n```c++\r\n    if (device_type_.defined()) {\r\n      if (const auto* dev_type = device_type_.as<IntImmNode>()) {\r\n        if (dev_type->value == kDLCPU) {\r\n          int32_t constant_size = op->constant_allocation_size();\r\n          if (constant_size > 0 && constant_size * nbytes < runtime::kMaxStackAlloca) {\r\n            return stmt;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nmay cause some performance regressions. But this optimization will raise LLVM function signature errors when there are multiple targets (For now, I cannot find an alternative fix to make this work).\r\n\r\nSo there may be two bugs in the current codebase:\r\n- the VM runtime (also maybe other parts) cannot handle the IR generated by the current main (e.g., if `constant_size` > `runtime::kMaxStackAlloca`)\r\n- when there are multiple targets, the generated IR / LLVM code with this PR is not correct.\r\n\r\nIf this problem blocks something urgent to merge, I think we can do a quick fix first (choose either one of the following two) and open a bug issue for further fix:\r\n- to fix the VTA unittest, we can remove the multiple targets test in `deploy_classification.py`. Just remove the \"sim\" in these three lines: [deploy_classification.py#L194](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1fac10b359dec1bd6ad45ce36541a882aaba586b/vta/tutorials/frontend/deploy_classification.py#L194), [deploy_classification.py#L206](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1fac10b359dec1bd6ad45ce36541a882aaba586b/vta/tutorials/frontend/deploy_classification.py#L206)\r\n[deploy_classification.py#L224](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1fac10b359dec1bd6ad45ce36541a882aaba586b/vta/tutorials/frontend/deploy_classification.py#L224)\r\n- to quick fix the test `tests/python/fronend/onnx/test_forward.py:test_loop`, remove the check `assert out[i] == inputs[j][i], \"Dims mismatch in the inputs of concatenate.\"` in the [_concatenate_shape_func](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1fac10b359dec1bd6ad45ce36541a882aaba586b/python/tvm/relay/op/_transform.py#L345).\r\n\r\nFor the two hidden bugs, I think it takes some time to find and fix them.\r\n\r\nWhat do you

The implementation of \"Tracker\" server mode is using using \"PureRPC\" as internal server. I've just expose it outside for person who would like to use direct connection to iOS without tracker/proxy. Removing this piece of functionality will not simplify implementation. \r\n\r\nThe main goal was to allow user and developers to work with iOS without requirements to keep tracker/proxy server. As example I have one laptop and one iOS device connected to it via USB (there are no local WiFi network at all, or it is very slow). With using PureRPC mode plus port tunnelling (via usbmux tool) I can work with such setup.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this patch I have a plan to introduce iOSRPCRunner script which will allow me to automate iOS test with quite simple code like next:\r\n```python\r\n    # Will use first connected iOS device with automatic TCP port tunnelling to host\r\n    ios_rpc_serv = RPCServerIOS.create_ios_rpc_server(key=key, mode=\"pure_server\")    \r\n    remote = rpc.connect(ios_rpc_serv.host, ios_rpc_serv.port, key=key)\r\n\r\n    do_some_test_with_ios(remote)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPort tunnelling may significantly speed up work with iOS device. My local benchmarking shows 3x-4x speed depends on kind of workload (yes, wifi router matter).\r\n\r\nDefinitely, the same speed up result can be also achieved with tracker. For this purpose I've introduced flag `--custom_addr`, which help to use USB port tunnelling (as result host address replacing) for tracker clients. But this solution still require to have iOS device and host machine connected to one local WiFi network.\r\n\r\nTotally, from my point of view, PureRPC is not so hard to support feature, but it can simplify/speedup my scripts in some cases :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/864056719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/864066215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8277#issuecomment-864066215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8277","id":864066215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDA2NjIxNQ==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-18T14:08:46Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T14:08:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @cailun01, there are some minor linting issues with your change.

I have no strong feelings other than really sticking with only one form, hence I think that PR makes sense indeed (ppl might even write mTVM sometimes, which doesn't look good at all). I'm just wondering if I missed any discussion or thread about favoring microTVM. Either way I think using microTVM is the right choice, because uTVM is often written also using the _mu_ symbol (Greek), which is confusing sometimes and might be difficult to type on some consoles. On Linux I also prefer typing \"micro\" instead of CTRL-Shift-u-b-5 :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/864320598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
