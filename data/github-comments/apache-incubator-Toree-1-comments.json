Initializing using the kernel object was a goal that Brian and I discussed and it looks like it makes more sense now, although you still have issues like lazily starting a SparkContext (and SQLContext) being bound to the interpreter later (more Scala than PySpark). Of course, if interpreters were made plugins, they could receive a SparkContext/SQLContext event when those were created and bind the variables at that point.\n\nThere are methods in the interpreter that are more interpreter-specific (class server uri stemming from the Scala 2.10 interpreter only), have a hideous API (interpret call's return value), or duplicate/confuse other methods (start vs init). Cleaning those up would be excellent.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/197131556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/197357400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/14#issuecomment-197357400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/14","id":197357400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzM1NzQwMA==","user":{"login":"Lull3rSkat3r","id":1383927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODM5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1383927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r","html_url":"https://github.com/Lull3rSkat3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lull3rSkat3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T14:35:36Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T14:35:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks

Instead of combining the values of `__TOREE_SPARK_OPTS__` and `SPARK_OPTS` they will be used in order of precedence. `SPARK_OPTS` will be used before `__TOREE_SPARK_OPTS__`. I did this to simplify how people will have to reason about ordering of their arguments, and to simplify `run.sh` :wink:.\n\nI tested the following enumerations and I have recorded the behvior, which IMO is correct:\n- This just starts the kernel with no extra arguments to spark\n\n``` bash\n# Define no spark opts\njupyter toree install --interpreters=PySpark,SQL,Scala,SparkR\njupyter notebook --ip=* --no-browser'\n```\n- This starts the kernel and waits for a debugger to connect\n\n``` bash\n# Define install spark_opts\njupyter toree install --spark_opts=\"--driver-java-options=-Dlog4j.logLevel=trace -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005\" --interpreters=PySpark,SQL,Scala,SparkR\njupyter notebook --ip=* --no-browser'\n```\n- This starts the kernel and I only see warning logs\n\n``` bash\n# Define install spark_opts and SPARK_OPTS\njupyter toree install --spark_opts=\"--driver-java-options=-Dlog4j.logLevel=trace -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005\" --interpreters=PySpark,SQL,Scala,SparkR \nSPARK_OPTS=\"--driver-java-options=-Dlog4j.logLevel=warn\" jupyter notebook --ip=* --no-browser'\n```\n- This starts the kernel and I only see warning logs\n\n``` bash\n# Define only SPARK_OPTS\njupyter toree install --interpreters=PySpark,SQL,Scala,SparkR \nSPARK_OPTS=\"--driver-java-options=-Dlog4j.logLevel=warn\" jupyter notebook --ip=* --no-browser'\n```\n\nThere is a slight hack I had to do. For the case where there are no options passed I was receving an error. This was caused by an empty string being interpreted as the class file to load. I fixed this by adding in the `--driver-class-path` option @chipsenkbeil and I are adding for the magics work. I am open for a better solution, but am lacking the bash-fu to get there. \n\nAny feedback @lbustelo @chipsenkbeil ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/198490762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/198503850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/11#issuecomment-198503850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/11","id":198503850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODUwMzg1MA==","user":{"login":"chipsenkbeil","id":2481802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODE4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2481802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil","html_url":"https://github.com/chipsenkbeil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-18T19:17:33Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T19:17:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Spoke with you in person.

That is where I was getting confused. \n\nSo here are the levels of backwards compatibility I see:\n1. Magics being under the package 'com.ibm.spark.kernel'\n2. Magics which are not plugins, but under 'org.apache.toree' (Brunel magic)\n\nAs @chipsenkbeil alluded above, the second item in the list is technically not a valid magic, since there has not yet been a release. Now the question remains about the first item.\n\nIMO there is no backwards compatibility to support because all magics will and should need to be recompiled against the first release of toree because of the package changing. Since there is a binary incompatibility in that regard, I don't think there is much sense in supporting older styles. The only way this would make sense is if we were going to continue to look in the `com.ibm.spark.kernel` package for magics.\n\n I vote we put a PR into the Brunel magic repo and remove the backwards compatibility code in MagicManager.

I used docker `-e` and it worked.\n\nNow, on installing by default all the interpreters... I think that we should only install what we think is satisfactory working. Here are some of the issues that I've found when scala is not the default interpreter.\n1. Magics are not handled at all. This means that from a SQL default interpreter I cannot add data to a context using any of the other languages supported. That makes the SQL interpreter very limited.\n2. If we install PySpark and SparkR in a default run of `jupyter toree install` as stand-alone kernels, are we sure that they can satisfactory perform the majority of what a user could accomplish with the Python kernel in jupyter or IRkernel? If the answer is no, then I think that by default I would only install the Scala Kernel but keep the `--interpreter` flag to install the other kernels. If yes, then I guess I'm ok with. \n\nI will just offer that in the context of the `all-spark-notebook` docker image, I don't see us ever installing Toree as multiple kernels and only installing the Scala one. It will make selecting a notebook confusing when it comes to R and Python.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/202941485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/203013704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/19#issuecomment-203013704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/19","id":203013704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzAxMzcwNA==","user":{"login":"chipsenkbeil","id":2481802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODE4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2481802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil","html_url":"https://github.com/chipsenkbeil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chipsenkbeil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T17:31:36Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T17:31:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lbustelo removed -v on sbt and got rid of backwards compatibility code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/203013704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/203029405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/19#issuecomment-203029405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/19","id":203029405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzAyOTQwNQ==","user":{"login":"lbustelo","id":2474841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2474841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo","html_url":"https://github.com/lbustelo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbustelo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T18:02:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T18:02:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ran streaming demo and all looked good.
