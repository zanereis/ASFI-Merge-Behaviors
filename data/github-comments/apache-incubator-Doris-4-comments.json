Friday, After I have developed the initial version and tested the FE Http API. **I found there were some `100-continue` http header issues**.\r\n\r\nBecause the  backendsPerBucketSeq meta maybe large, I wanted to extract the backendsPerBucketSeq meta by Http post body, not parameter. So I used `HttpObjectAggregator` and get http body by `FullHttpRequest`, All Api for Colocate Join Meta worked well, but `HttpObjectAggregator`  is conflicting with `LoadAction`. `HttpObjectAggregator`  will handle `100-continue` header and remove it, which isn't we expected.\r\n\r\nSo I customized a `DorisHttpObjectAggregator` by copying the `HttpObjectAggregator` and removing \r\n`100-continue` header handle logic. then, the Java HTTP client could request `LoadAction` successfully.  but the curl client request `LoadAction`  still get a error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Empty reply from server\r\n* Connection #0 to host xxx left intact\r\ncurl: (52) Empty reply from server\r\n```\r\nAfter I debugged, I found which should be the java Http client and curl client have different response logic for Netty Server.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Netty. I think there are at least three ways to resolve this `100-continue` http header issue:\r\n\r\n1. extract the backendsPerBucketSeq meta by Http parameter, not http body.\r\n2. directly parse `HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, `LastHttpContent`, not use `HttpObjectAggregator`\r\n3. customize `HttpObjectAggregator`, and dive into why curl client get the error.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  I prefer the first way, although which isn't canonical，which is simple.\r\n\r\n@imay  @morningman What do you think of it?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/455936589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/455945319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/549#issuecomment-455945319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/549","id":455945319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTk0NTMxOQ==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T04:31:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T04:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kangkaisen \r\nCould you provide more details when executing `LoadAction` with curl.\r\nYou can use `curl -v` to print more information. \r\n\r\nAnd did you use `curl` client with `--location-trusted` option?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/455945319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/455946067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/549#issuecomment-455946067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/549","id":455946067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTk0NjA2Nw==","user":{"login":"kangkaisen","id":9894906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTQ5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9894906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen","html_url":"https://github.com/kangkaisen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T04:37:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T04:37:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.
