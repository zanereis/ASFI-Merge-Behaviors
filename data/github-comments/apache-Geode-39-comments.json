When we do get to the point of spinning out a `geode-logging` module that would be the appropriate time to make it `api` scope.

I would be surprised to discover it actually enforces nothing (actually the reverse, it is a suppression), and very surprised that it actually applies only shallowly and only to statics, especially since its javadoc comment claims it is \"broadly similar to the Java Concurrency in Practice annotation\".\r\n\r\nStatic members are not generally thought of as part of the class, just namespaced global variables/constants.  I would much prefer that the only way to mark _static_ references as immutable is one-at-a-time.\r\n\r\nThe discuss thread from February seems far from settled on how our version of @Immutable should behave at the class level, as the discussion was really centered elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the concept of an _immutable reference_ and an _immutable class_ are two very different things; we really should not be using the same annotation for both.  We should never have overloaded @Immutable, as it has precedent as a class-level-only annotation; we should have picked a different name for our custom Geode annotation for marking effectively-immutable _references_, e.g. @EffectivelyImmutable.\r\n\r\nThat said, annotations like @Immutable do not actually prescribe how any tooling might or might not use them.  So, as long as classes being marked with @Immutable do in fact follow the generally-accepted semantics of an immutable class, then I guess also using it as a bulk \"ignore\" flag to work around PMD shortcomings could be tenable for now.\r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27101978/what-is-the-advantage-of-annotating-an-immutable-java-class-with-immutable\r\n[2]

agreed, and the detailed response is really appreciated 👍.\r\nThat said, just one more thing: according to the [original PR description](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3178):\r\n\r\n```\r\nImmutable - mark classes or fields that are really immutable as immutable. The pmd rule can ignore these.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above (plus the fact that my class was effectively immutable and annotated with the `@Immutable` annotation) is what made me think I was actually hitting a bug in our custom rule, that's why I opened the ticket and made the changes. Deciding whether we should rename and re-think our current annotations should be addressed through another ticket, and probably after some discussion within the dev list.\r\nIf there's not enough consensus to merge this PR I'll just change the rule documentation without touching the actual implementation, at the end of the day it won't kill anyone to annotate multiple fields instead of the class 🤷‍♂.\r\n\r\n@upthewaterspout @Bill :

If you think its safe for connection references that race into the map on close to sit there then this is an easy fix. A simple check if the collection is closed after the put completes could accomplish this. The close itself would empty the map and any race on that operation would get cleared up on the back end after the put by checking for closed state and removing the entry just put.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/535153711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/535567323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4095#issuecomment-535567323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4095","id":535567323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTU2NzMyMw==","user":{"login":"metatype","id":2790361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2790361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype","html_url":"https://github.com/metatype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T15:49:59Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T15:49:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pdxrunner Could you accomplish the same thing w/o adding a new option?

you consider using `java.time.*` classes instead of `java.util.Date`? I think the best practice is to use the former unless there is a reason why only `java.util.Date` will do. Jon Skeet has an [interesting article](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2017/04/23/all-about-java-util-date/) about the difference.\r\n\r\nIf you do switch to a `java.time.*` class, you'll have to be careful about time zones. By default `java.util.Date` uses the system-local time zone which in this case happens to be the same as the time zone in the logs so it works out by happenstance. But if you switch to `java.time.Instant` (basically the analogue to Date), that class defaults to UTC. You'd have to make sure the string version which is output by the command matches the time zone in the logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/537188648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/537375517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4087#issuecomment-537375517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4087","id":537375517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzM3NTUxNw==","user":{"login":"mkevo","id":48509719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo","html_url":"https://github.com/mkevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T07:39:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T07:39:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @aaronlindsey!

Anyway, I was working on reducing the verbosity of the scripts, so right now the warnings will not be shown.\r\n\r\nThe output of `build-docs.sh` will be the following\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./build-docs.sh \r\nBuilding geode/docsbuild:0.1 image...\r\nsha256:61ae0ed1c6d7ae38344f7d741518edb63faab38be1b3665361a8d585216c0aa1\r\nBuilding geode/docsbuild:0.1-alb3rtobr image...\r\nsha256:aabf47c7a03f72b89b154dec11042877a1395a1b75a887caf80a154a4c3883b4\r\nRunning Bookbinder inside Docker container to generate documentation...\r\n  Complete log can be found in /home/alb3rtobr/git/Nordix/geode/dev-tools/docker/docs/build-docs-output.txt\r\nBookbinder bound your book into /home/alb3rtobr/git/Nordix/geode/geode-book/final_app\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case there is a problem with bookbinder and the output is not generated, the output will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./build-docs.sh \r\nBuilding geode/docsbuild:0.1 image...\r\nsha256:61ae0ed1c6d7ae38344f7d741518edb63faab38be1b3665361a8d585216c0aa1\r\nBuilding geode/docsbuild:0.1-alb3rtobr image...\r\nsha256:aabf47c7a03f72b89b154dec11042877a1395a1b75a887caf80a154a4c3883b4\r\nRunning Bookbinder inside Docker container to generate documentation...\r\n  Complete log can be found in /home/alb3rtobr/git/Nordix/geode/dev-tools/docker/docs/build-docs-output.txt\r\nSomething went wrong while generating documentation, check log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the output of `view-docs.sh` will be as follows (this has not been reduced so much because its interesting to know if the server is ready):\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./view-docs.sh \r\nBuilding geode/docsbuild:0.1 image...\r\nsha256:61ae0ed1c6d7ae38344f7d741518edb63faab38be1b3665361a8d585216c0aa1\r\nBuilding geode/docsbuild:0.1-alb3rtobr image...\r\nsha256:aabf47c7a03f72b89b154dec11042877a1395a1b75a887caf80a154a4c3883b4\r\nStarting up web server...\r\nFetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/.............\r\nFetching version metadata from http://rubygems.org/..\r\nResolving dependencies...\r\nInstalling multi_json 1.12.1\r\nInstalling multipart-post 2.0.0\r\nInstalling libv8 3.16.14.15\r\nInstalling mimemagic 0.3.2\r\nInstalling puma 3.6.0 with native extensions\r\nInstalling rack 2.0.1\r\nUsing rack-rewrite 1.5.1\r\nUsing ref 2.0.0\r\nInstalling smtpapi 0.1.0\r\nUsing bundler 1.13.6\r\nInstalling elasticsearch-api 2.0.0\r\nInstalling faraday 0.9.2\r\nInstalling therubyracer 0.12.2 with native extensions\r\nInstalling elasticsearch-transport 2.0.0\r\nInstalling sendgrid-ruby 1.1.6\r\nInstalling elasticsearch 2.0.0\r\nBundle complete!

with a fixed key, causing that all subsequents method invocations for the query (even forbidden ones like `getClass()`) to be wrongly
