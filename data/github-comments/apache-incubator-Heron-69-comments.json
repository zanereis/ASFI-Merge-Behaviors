I was working through the issue, I've hit a couple issues looking at the code on master that maybe have been fixed in another branch I dont know about.\r\n\r\n1. Baremetal refers to ledger disk, everything else refers to data-disk\r\ntrying to run helm chart with baremetal fails because it doesnt know what data-disk is\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/6ce013cf262b8d413aec8c6e628ce363ef717ff1/deploy/kubernetes/helm/templates/bookie.yaml#L141\r\n\r\nSo I changed it to minikube and got past that error as a temp fix\r\n\r\n2. my \"the server could not find the requested resource\" problem\r\nI've narrowed my problem down to the line below\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/6ce013cf262b8d413aec8c6e628ce363ef717ff1/deploy/kubernetes/helm/templates/tools.yaml#L18\r\n\r\nmy theory, is that the\"-\" in \"{{- $platform\" and the one on the other side of \".Values.apiServerMemory -}}\" removes all white space between the comments and \"apiVersion: v1\". The problem, I think, is that this removes so much whitespace that \"apiVersion: v1\" actually gets commented out, like so:\r\n\"#  under the License.apiVersion: v1\"\r\nremoving the first \"-\" from \"{{- $platform\" caused my error to go away, as well as copying the \"apiVersion: v1\" line and pasting it directly below itself.\r\n\r\nThat at least gets me to the point where I can helm install

If you use the docker scripts in this [folder](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/tree/master/docker) to build a heron docker image with the base as debian9 the helm deployment will fail since this `wait-for-zookeeper.sh` script is not present in the container.
