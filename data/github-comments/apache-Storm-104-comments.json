A batch of tuples is assembled at the source and piped through the topology. The batch stays a batch the whole time.</p>\n\n<p>This is quite different from my approach: Tuples are only batched \"under the hood\" and tuple-by-tuple processing semantics are preserved. A batch is assembled at the output of an operator and \"de-assembled\" at the consumer. The consumer does not need to batch its own output. Hence, batching is introduced on a operator basis, ie, for each operator batching (the output) can be enabled and disabled independently (also allowing for different batch sizes for different operators and different batch sizes for different output streams). Thus, the latency might not increase as much as batch size can be adjusted fine grained. Additionally, if a single tuple fails, only this single tuple needs to get replayed (and not the whole batch as in Trident).</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"revans2\">Robert Joseph Evans</a> encourage me to contribute this feature.

And in fact it could be the bolt itself, and it needs to increase it's parallelism.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612570185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612563580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4695#issuecomment-2612563580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4695","id":2612563580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1NjM1ODA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T13:37:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:43:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mjsax\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"mjsax\">Matthias J.

In trident the microbatch is logical only.  The batch is used to divide the tuples into distinct logical groups that can be committed to a state store as a whole.  The tuples still flow through storm one at a time.  This feature, however, is intended to provide a knob that allows you to give up some latency for increased throughput.  When profiling storm one of the things I notice is that a very large percentage of the CPU is used context switching, and waking up threads.  This is great for very low latency processing, but provides a huge overhead per tuple.  If we can batch the tuples together in a single data structure we amortize the overhead of those context switches, and we can get increased throughput but at the cost of waiting for a batch to fill.</p>\n\n<p>After talking to Matthias, I have been thinking about this feature a lot, and I honestly don't know the best way to implement it.  Flink uses a different mechanism where the input buffer to each bolt equivalent will wait to wake-up the processing piece until a timeout occurs or a specific number of tuples is reached.  This is essentially micro batching the input to each bolt dynamically.  I am starting to lean more towards that side for a few reasons.  First it allows for a very fine grained tuning, on a per bolt basis. It makes knowing how congested a bolt or queue is much simpler.  And the batching efficiency does not degrade with the depth of the topology.  In this case each batch as it flows through a grouping is likely to be split into smaller and smaller batches to the point that the batch has a very small number of tuples in it. All of these feel like they would make <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-815\" title=\"Auto tuning topologies based on user submitted SLA\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-815\"><del>STORM-815</del></a> much more likely to work well.</p>\n\n<p>That said this has an implementation that will give users a benefit now.  How about this I will try to come up with a quick prototype for disruptor queue microbatching as an alternative, and we can see through actual benchmarks how close they are to each other performance wise, and how much impact there is on the code base.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612563580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/135433954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/703#issuecomment-135433954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/703","id":135433954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTQzMzk1NA==","user":{"login":"ooasis","id":10720176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIwMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10720176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis","html_url":"https://github.com/ooasis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooasis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T13:40:48Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T13:40:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure, will make the change and resubmit.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/135433954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612587610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4832#issuecomment-2612587610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4832","id":2612587610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODc2MTA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T15:16:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:55:10Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dossett\">dossett</a>:</i>\n<p>Could this manifest itself by nimbus failing due to running out of Thrift Server threads?

This approach could have some impact to performance, as it guarantees that downstream events, per-channel, are ordered when sending.
