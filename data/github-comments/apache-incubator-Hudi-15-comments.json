Yes, with Hive-1.2.1, the maven profile is hive12 (default). When I tested similar setup, I did not encounter this issue. This is caused by shading some of hive jars and including them in the bundle (bit of a magic by trial and error).  \r\n\r\nIt is not clear from your comment if you solved this by disabling shading ?  \r\n\r\nCan you also try shading hive-metastore jar. Add this relocation in the shading section of pom.xml of hoodie-spark -\r\n                <relocation>\r\n                  <pattern>org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.</pattern>\r\n                  <shadedPattern>com.uber.hoodie.org.apache.hadoop_hive.metastore.</shadedPattern>\r\n                </relocation>\r\n\r\nLet me know if this solves the problem.
