In fact I'm also entangled with whether to put the `setStartFromSpecificDate` method into `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase`, and I put it into `FlinkKafkaComsumerBase` finally for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. All the other methods that set the Kafka start offset are in `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase`, to keep it aligned, I put `setStartFromSpecificDate` in `FlinkKafkaComsumerBase`\r\n2. For subsequent versions of Kafka, such as version 0.11, this feature should be available also, but it may need to extend from the `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase` directly.
