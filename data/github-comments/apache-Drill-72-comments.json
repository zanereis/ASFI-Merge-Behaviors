The only new thing I have to add to the discussion of this PR is a request on the Maven dependencies.  Please may you look at what I've done in the `pom.xml` files to see whether it can be done better?  I struggled for a long time to get aircompressor-0.1 out of drill-hive-exec-shaded-1.20.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.  In the end the only thing that worked was shading it to a new namespace with `<relocate>`.  Maven just seeemd to ignore my `<exclusion>` attempts, either under `<dependency>` or under the maven-shade-plugin config.  I'm still confused about this.

What I found now is, in MacOS,  JDK installed by HomeBrew saves in path ”Internet Plug-Ins“ with a whitespace.

I have ever tried use regex to replace whitespace with \"\\  \" in runbit, but still not work. What I did now is just use a java path without whitespace.

Now it passes all verifications.\r\n\r\nI've found the root cause why the test was failing - the reason was that in my previous revision, method `DrillConnectionImpl#isValid` could close a connection if `DrillClient#ping` return `false` (what means, that connection is not valid, drillbit doesn't answer), and the test was written so, that every method of `Connection` is tested on the same connection, and if some of the methods close connection all farther methods will get a closed connection.\r\n\r\nAs the test uses \"dummy values\" to invoke methods, `DrillClient#ping` is invoked with 0 timeout, which leads to unpredictable situations, when on some machines `DrillClient#ping` returns `false`, because the timeout is 0 and the method checks whether PONG answer was received without a wait.\r\n\r\nI've revised my fix and decided, that `DrillConnectionImpl#isValid` shouldn't close a connection, even if it was found, that the connection is not valid - a method should do only one thing and only what is expected from it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/948429459/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/948448967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2342#issuecomment-948448967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2342","id":948448967,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc44iC7H","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T09:57:13Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T09:57:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cgivre, thank you.

Here is some background.\r\n\r\nFor systems such as MySQL, the connection to the server can remain open, but idle if no queries are sent. At some point, the MySql server will close the connection due to inactivity. The client won't know this until it tries to take some action. In this case, `isValid()` makes sense: it sends something to see if anyone is still on the other end.\r\n\r\nIn Drill's case, there is always the heartbeat, so the connection will never timeout from disuse, only from a network failure or because the server failed. So, the client always knows that the connection is still valid (or was at the time of the last heartbeat. We can check how frequently they occur; I think it is on the order of 30 seconds or so, but I may be wrong.)\r\n\r\nThe Drill JDBC connection uses Drill's native home-grown Netty-based RPC mechanism. That mechanism includes keep-alive heartbeats. On servers, each Drillbit sends the Ping/Pong messages to each other to verify that the Drillbits are still up. In fact, in the old days, somethings things would fail under heavy load because the CPU was so busy that the heartbeat thread didn't get a chance to run, and the connection was assumed failed.\r\n\r\nThe Ping/Pong messages occur over the same channel as the data flow. We had cases where the client was slow to read data, and thus a heartbeat message was backed up behind data batches and the connection ended up failing as a result. I don't recall how we resolved that. Did we disable heartbeat for clients? Move heartbeat to the control channel?\r\n\r\nGiven all this, the extra work in `isValid()` is not as necessary as it is with other systems such as MySQL. Still, no harm in adding an extra check. So, the question is, does the `isValid()` method need to know the state at this exact instant? Or, is it good enough to know that the connection was OK when we last checked 30 seconds (or whatever) ago? Either way, we'll keep checking in the background whether the client asks or not.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/949284641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/949391299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2327#issuecomment-949391299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2327","id":949391299,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc44lo_D","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T08:11:39Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T08:11:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @dzamo Per your request, I thought about this some more and added the ability to configure the batch size for the `INSERT` queries.

I thought of one more possible optimisation: creating a parameterised INSERT PreparedStatement of writer_batch_size rows and reusing it for as long as there are >= writer_batch_size rows remaining to insert.  I don't know Calcite stuff but I can say I saw a class called SqlDynamicParam in it.  This would mean that the receiving DBMS does not need to parse a very long INSERT statement at the start of every batch, a noticeable saving of memory and CPU time for it I would guess.  Just a possible optimisation I wanted to share, I view it as something that can also come in a later version.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/949391299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/949560720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2327#issuecomment-949560720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2327","id":949560720,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc44mSWQ","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T11:55:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T11:55:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @dzamo @vvysotskyi and @luocooong for your review!

Or, is it good enough to know that the connection was OK when we last checked 30 seconds (or whatever) ago?   \r\n\r\nI think the answer is pretty easy and very predictable — yes, the method needs to know the state at this exact instant, as it is required by JDBC API and is described in [java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#isValid-int-). As we implement some interface we should comply with it, so as users may simply use Drill JDBC driver without deep knowledge of its implementation and the method result will be predictable.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nAnd let me comment on other parts of your message.\r\n\r\n> ...So, the client always knows that the connection is still valid (or was at the time of the last heartbeat. We can check how frequently they occur; I think it is on the order of 30 seconds or so, but I may be wrong.   \r\n\r\nThe current implementation does not correspond to what you said. For a now, only the server always knows that the connection is still valid, because it receives a heartbeat from the client, while the client doesn't check, whether the server (drillbit) has answered on the PING with a PONG. Heartbeat mechanism was implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/drill/commit/960f876a1945eee4eeb0d6a98c5c58dfe2eea1a9), and there were missed functions that on the client side checks whether the server answers for requests.   \r\n\r\nThere are [`IdleStateHandler`](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/960f876a1945eee4eeb0d6a98c5c58dfe2eea1a9/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/rpc/BasicClient.java#L119) that sends PING (heartbeat) request if the client doesn't send any request for a while. But this handler, [doesn't check, whether the client received a PONG answer](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/960f876a1945eee4eeb0d6a98c5c58dfe2eea1a9/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/rpc/RpcBus.java#L266) from the server. I may suppose, that author of this logic (heartbeat) believed, that netty's [`Future#isSuccess`](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/util/concurrent/Future.html#isSuccess--) will return `false` if the server [didn't receive PING message](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/960f876a1945eee4eeb0d6a98c5c58dfe2eea1a9/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/rpc/BasicClient.java#L123), but it doesn't: `Future#isSuccess` mean only successful flush to a socket and it doesn't mean that any data was delivered ([source](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/10343#issuecomment-641365702)).    \r\n\r\nTherefore, the client doesn't have any mechanism, that checks whether the server (drillbit) still answers. And in cases when drillbit is not accessible now due to network issues, drillbit failing, etc — the client (or HikariCP for example) will think, that connection is still valid.\r\n\r\n>  ...I think it is on the order of 30 seconds or so, but I may be wrong.   \r\n\r\nIt is 15 seconds by default and calculates as `drill.exec.rpc.user.timeout` * 0.5 ([souserce](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/4aefcef2b665c5737471664912a26ef6ed9a6cfc/exec/rpc/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/rpc/BasicClient.java#L87)).\r\n\r\n> ...a heartbeat message was backed up behind data batches and the connection ended up failing as a result.   \r\n\r\nI even heard about cases, when zookeeper was losing drillbit from a cluster, because it didn't send heartbeat in time due to garbage collector freeze. And therefore in infrequent cases, queries may fail, because a foreman decides, that one of the drillbits is lost.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/949656576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/949763798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2333#issuecomment-949763798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2333","id":949763798,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc44nD7W","user":{"login":"rymarm","id":62295633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjk1NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62295633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm","html_url":"https://github.com/rymarm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymarm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T16:04:28Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T16:04:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank @paul-rogers for your review!

I wonder, in addition to your other work, can you fix up the missing functionality in the current heartbeat implementation? Seems silly for us to send heartbeats, but ignore the results. That way, for Drill versions older than the one with your server-side fix, we'd know `isValid()` within the last 15 seconds, which seems pretty good.\r\n\r\nAlso, can your new work simply use the existing ping mechanism so we don't have to change the server? That would eliminate the RPC versioning issues.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your remaining fix, then I'll give the code another review. Ping me when you're ready.
