I don't think we could assume every user of SkyWalking could be a easy contributor for SkyWalking, which requires lots of skills and background. And as the kind users, we are doing the best for sumit the possible bug for this specific open source project. We are just trying to do the same great as what you genius contributors do.

At the same time, GitHub milestone is set when you asked. Open source project has to depend on contributors, that is the way it lives. I know, there are a lot of open source projects in China maintained by an individual or one single company. So, people could submit an issue and look forward to fixed in the short term.\r\n\r\nBut in SkyWalking, and many diverse communities in Apache, it is working in this way. Our so-called PMC team(core team) are all volunteers, they respond to their own agenda. They contribute the things they want, fix issues they think critical. \r\n\r\nYou could see in many issues, I respond welcome to submit contributions/pull requests because that is the only way worked out. That is why SkyWalking could keep growing w/o a single company controlled. And only in those cases, the project could be better with time, even some core members are busy and leave the project, even I am busy in something else, someones like @kezhenxu94 @zhaoyuguang @peng-yongsheng could step in, work with the community and make progress.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/525554380/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/525555063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3355#issuecomment-525555063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3355","id":525555063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTU1NTA2Mw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-28T02:16:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T02:16:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please try the latest release.

Add logstash logback plugin\r\n\r\n## 1.user guide\r\n\r\n- Dependency the toolkit, such as using maven or gradle\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.apache.skywalking</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>apm-toolkit-logback-1.x</artifactId>\r\n    <version>${skywalking.version}</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- set `LogstashEncoder` of logback.xml\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<encoder charset=\"UTF-8\" class=\"net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder\">\r\n    <provider class=\"org.apache.skywalking.apm.toolkit.log.logback.v1.x.logstash.TraceIdJsonProvider\">\r\n    </provider>\r\n    <customFields>{\"app_id\":\"${app_id}\"}</customFields>\r\n</encoder>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2.why it works\r\n\r\n- extension of logstash-logback-encoder provider, [official guide](https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder#custom-json-provider)\r\n- Custom LogstashEncoder JSON Provider like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<encoder class=\"net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder\">\r\n    ...\r\n    <provider class=\"your.provider.YourJsonProvider\">\r\n        <!-- Any properties exposed by your provider can be set here -->\r\n    </provider>\r\n    ...\r\n</encoder>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- TraceIdJsonProvider analyze\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TraceIdJsonProvider extends AbstractFieldJsonProvider<ILoggingEvent> implements FieldNamesAware<LogstashFieldNames> {\r\n\r\n    public static final String TRACING_ID = \"TID\";\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void writeTo(JsonGenerator generator, ILoggingEvent event) throws IOException {\r\n        Map<String, String> map = event.getLoggerContextVO().getPropertyMap();\r\n        JsonWritingUtils.writeStringField(generator, getFieldName(), map.get(TRACING_ID));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void setFieldNames(LogstashFieldNames fieldNames) {\r\n        setFieldName(TRACING_ID);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. the setFieldNames method will add a json field named `TID`\r\n2. the writeTo method will set the `TID` value, for `propertyMap` is always not null, it at least contains `destination` of logstash, so the code will not throw `NPE`\r\n\r\n- TcpSocketAppenderActivation analyze\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TcpSocketAppenderActivation extends ClassInstanceMethodsEnhancePluginDefine {\r\n\r\n    public static final String INTERCEPT_CLASS = \"org.apache.skywalking.apm.toolkit.activation.log.logback.v1.x.logstash.TcpSocketAppenderInterceptor\";\r\n    public static final String ENHANCE_CLASS = \"net.logstash.logback.appender.LogstashTcpSocketAppender\";\r\n    public static final String ENHANCE_METHOD = \"prepareForDeferredProcessing\";\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return the target class, which needs active.\r\n     */\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected ClassMatch enhanceClass() {\r\n        return byName(ENHANCE_CLASS);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return null, no need to intercept constructor of enhance class.\r\n     */\r\n    @Override\r\n    public ConstructorInterceptPoint[] getConstructorsInterceptPoints() {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @return the collection of {@link StaticMethodsInterceptPoint}, represent the intercepted methods and their\r\n     * interceptors.\r\n     */\r\n    @Override\r\n    public InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint[] getInstanceMethodsInterceptPoints() {\r\n        return new InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint[] {\r\n            new InstanceMethodsInterceptPoint() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public ElementMatcher<MethodDescription> getMethodsMatcher() {\r\n                    return named(ENHANCE_METHOD).and(takesArgumentWithType(0, \"ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.ILoggingEvent\"));\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                @Override\r\n                public String getMethodsInterceptor() {\r\n                    return INTERCEPT_CLASS;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                @Override public boolean isOverrideArgs() {\r\n                    return false;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. net.logstash.logback.appender.`LogstashTcpSocketAppender` is logstash appender, contains a method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void prepareForDeferredProcessing(final ILoggingEvent event) {\r\n        super.prepareForDeferredProcessing(event);\r\n        if (includeCallerData) {\r\n            event.getCallerData();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. so we enhance it by the `beforeMethod` of `TcpSocketAppenderInterceptor` :\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override public void beforeMethod(EnhancedInstance objInst, Method method, Object[] allArguments,\r\n        Class<?>[] argumentsTypes, MethodInterceptResult result) throws Throwable {\r\n        ILoggingEvent event = (ILoggingEvent)allArguments[0];\r\n        if (event != null && event.getLoggerContextVO() != null && event.getLoggerContextVO().getPropertyMap() != null) {\r\n            event.getLoggerContextVO().getPropertyMap().put(\"TID\", ContextManager.getGlobalTraceId());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. it put a key value of `(TID, ContextManager.getGlobalTraceId())` to the `ILoggingEvent`, so we can get it in the `writeTo` method of `TraceIdJsonProvider` \r\n4. the method `prepareForDeferredProcessing` of `LogstashTcpSocketAppender` works on the worker thread, but others works on the logstash thread, because `logstash-logback-encoder` is a async plugin, so we enhance it by this way\r\n\r\n## 3.related pictures\r\n\r\n- ConsoleAppender
