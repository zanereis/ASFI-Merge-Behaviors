I'm not entirely sure we can encapsulate all those in a few keywords. For instance, indexing config is one subset.

you are running in docker, then you can config the dns resolvable host name in config file.\r\n\r\nFor docker, usually we can give each container a name, like `pinot-controller-0`, `pinot-broker-1`.\r\nE.g. below will start a pinot controller in container named `pinot-controller-0`\r\n```\r\ndocker run --rm -ti \\\r\n    --name pinot-controller-0 \\\r\n    --network=pinot-demo \\\r\n    --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/pinot-docker-conf,target=/tmp \\\r\n    -p 9000:9000 \\\r\n    apachepinot/pinot:latest StartController \\\r\n    -configFileName /tmp/controller.conf\r\n```\r\nThen for this setup we can configure the pinot controller host name registered in zk by adding below line into controller configure file.\r\n```\r\ncontroller.host=pinot-controller-0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we can configure pinot server conf by adding below line:\r\n```\r\npinot.server.netty.host=pinot-server-0\r\n```\r\nThis `pinot-server-0` is the docker container name, so when we start the docker container, we need to specify the `--name `\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\ndocker run --rm -ti \\\r\n    --name pinot-server-0 \\\r\n    --network=pinot-demo \\\r\n    --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/pinot-docker-conf,target=/tmp \\\r\n    apachepinot/pinot:latest StartServer \\\r\n    -zkAddress zookeeper:2181 -clusterName pinot-docker \\\r\n    -configFileName /tmp/server.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Pinot broker, it's a bit tricky, the config to add right now is: \r\n`instanceId=Broker_${broker_host}_${broker_port}`\r\n```\r\ninstanceId=Broker_pinot-broker-0_8099\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can goto `localhost:9000` to see that pinot instances names don't have ip address in
