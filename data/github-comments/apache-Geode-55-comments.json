After the compaction, the original non-compacted krf is also deleted. Without a krf, there is a significant impact on the performance of persistent recovery.

Also check that it actually resets all the stats (I think at least one was missing).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/742046914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/742069511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5832#issuecomment-742069511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5832","id":742069511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjA2OTUxMQ==","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T21:21:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T21:21:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Why are the two tests modified in this PR setting the the value against the new default? If the default is `false` now it stands to reason that unless a tests is explicitly testing socket conservation that it should use the new default of `false`.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing this up, Jake. After looking closer at the first test, `ClusterDistributionManagerDUnitTest`, it doesn't need to explicitly set conserve-sockets to true, just add an additional ignored exception due to a slightly different code path resulting in (expected) logging about `ack-severe-alert-threshold` being exceeded. I've modified the test to reflect this.\r\n\r\nThe second test, `CloseConnectionTest` is explicitly testing the behaviour of shared connections, so it requires that conserve-sockets=true. I think it was just an oversight to not set the value and instead rely on the default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/742069511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/742864483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5837#issuecomment-742864483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5837","id":742864483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Mjg2NDQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"pivotal-eshu","id":11180099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgwMDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11180099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu","html_url":"https://github.com/pivotal-eshu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T23:24:26Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T23:24:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Might it be worth adding a test case to confirm that when the `DistributionManager.MAX_FE_THREADS` property is set, that value is used?

So far, I still consider the current fix is the best option we can have. We need a convenient and reliable way to tell that the Oplog is offline compacted. The persisted `0` value of `totalCount` in krf serves the purpose. And during persistence recovery, if `totalCount` is `0`, then it is updated with the value of `totalLiveCount`, which is the most accurate value of the number of live entries in the Oplog.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about whether we should use the local variable `krfEntryCount`, instead of `totalLiveCount`. At the end of `readKrf()`, the value of `totalLiveCount` and `krfEntryCount` are the same. Because at the beginning of `readKrf()`, `totalLiveCount` and `krfEntryCount` are both 0. And in the `while` loop inside `readKrf()`, both variables are incremented together: \r\n\r\n`totalLiveCount` is incremented here: https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/Oplog.java#L1765\r\n\r\n`krfEntryCount` is incremented here: https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/Oplog.java#L1768\r\n\r\nI'd prefer using `totalLiveCount` instead of `krfEntryCount` which is a local variable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/744970105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/744979874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5848#issuecomment-744979874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5848","id":744979874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDk3OTg3NA==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T01:39:07Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T01:39:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging 997caf3ed02d99c1ec3f480ffe13d80510edb1ab into 1da2e6558d5ea57c25762e25689c2bede1ca3ed2 - [view on LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/geode/rev/pr-1b9ff133a6705b16989cc3b10fd909e602e3637e)\n\n**fixed alerts:**\n\n* 1 for Dereferenced variable may be null","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/744979874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/745385708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5840#issuecomment-745385708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5840","id":745385708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTM4NTcwOA==","user":{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T15:58:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T15:58:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jinmeiliao Yes, good idea.

Start server 1 with a gateway sender with enforce-threads-connect-same-receiver=false\r\n\r\nThe servers successfully start up in this case, but I don't think they should with these conflicting property values.\r\n\r\nThe gfsh commands look like:\r\n```\r\nstart server --name=server-A-1 --group=server-A-1 --locators=localhost[10331] --mcast-port=0 --server-port=0\r\n\r\nstart server --name=server-A-2 --group=server-A-2 --locators=localhost[10331] --mcast-port=0 --server-port=0\r\n\r\ncreate gateway-sender --id=B --group=server-A-1 --remote-distributed-system-id=2 --enforce-threads-connect-same-receiver=true\r\n\r\ncreate gateway-sender --id=B --group=server-A-2 --remote-distributed-system-id=2 --enforce-threads-connect-same-receiver=false\r\n```\r\nThe generated xml looks like:\r\n\r\nserver-A-1:\r\n```\r\n<cache ...>\r\n  <gateway-sender enforce-threads-connect-same-receiver=\"true\" id=\"B\" .../>\r\n</cache>\r\n```\r\nserver-A-2:\r\n```\r\n<cache ...>\r\n  <gateway-sender enforce-threads-connect-same-receiver=\"false\" id=\"B\" .../>\r\n</cache>\r\n```\r\nHere is an example where conflicting gateway sender parameters cause the startup to fail:\r\n```\r\ncreate gateway-sender --id=B --group=server-A-1 --remote-distributed-system-id=2 --parallel=true\r\n\r\ncreate gateway-sender --id=B --group=server-A-2 --remote-distributed-system-id=2 --parallel=false\r\n```\r\nThis error message is logged:\r\n```\r\nExecuting - create gateway-sender --id=B --group=server-A-2 --remote-distributed-system-id=2 --parallel=false\r\n\r\n  Member   | Status | Message\r\n---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nserver-A-2 | ERROR  |  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot create Gateway Sender B as serial gateway sender because another cache has the same sender as parallel gateway sender\r\n\r\nAnd this error message is in the logs:\r\n\r\n[error 2021/01/05 12:05:51.385 PST server-A-2 <Function Execution Processor2> tid=0x3f] Cannot create Gateway Sender B as serial gateway sender because another cache has the same sender as parallel gateway sender\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot create Gateway Sender B as serial gateway sender because another cache has the same sender as parallel gateway sender\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.internal.cache.wan.GatewaySenderAdvisor.checkCompatibility(GatewaySenderAdvisor.java:125)\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.internal.cache.wan.GatewaySenderAdvisor.profileCreated(GatewaySenderAdvisor.java:105)\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.DistributionAdvisor.doPutProfile(DistributionAdvisor.java:625)\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.DistributionAdvisor.putProfile(DistributionAdvisor.java:523)\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.DistributionAdvisor.putProfile(DistributionAdvisor.java:518)\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.DistributionAdvisor$Profile.handleDistributionAdvisee(DistributionAdvisor.java:1537)\r\n\tat Remote Member '10.166.145.67(server-A-1:89588)<v1>:41001' in org.apache.geode.internal.cache.wan.GatewaySenderAdvisor$GatewaySenderProfile.processIncoming(GatewaySenderAdvisor.java:708)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.ReplyException.handleCause(ReplyException.java:86)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.internal.cache.UpdateAttributesProcessor.waitForProfileResponse(UpdateAttributesProcessor.java:113)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.internal.cache.UpdateAttributesProcessor.distribute(UpdateAttributesProcessor.java:99)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.internal.cache.GemFireCacheImpl.addGatewaySender(GemFireCacheImpl.java:3732)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.internal.cache.wan.GatewaySenderFactoryImpl.create(GatewaySenderFactoryImpl.java:300)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.management.internal.cli.functions.GatewaySenderCreateFunction.createGatewaySender(GatewaySenderCreateFunction.java:183)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.management.internal.cli.functions.GatewaySenderCreateFunction.execute(GatewaySenderCreateFunction.java:60)\r\n```\r\nSomething similar should happen with the enforce-threads-connect-same-receiver property.\r\n\r\nThis check and error message are coming from GatewaySenderAdvisor.checkCompatibility.\r\n\r\nGatewaySenderProfile needs to be updated to include enforceThreadsConnectSameReceiver.
