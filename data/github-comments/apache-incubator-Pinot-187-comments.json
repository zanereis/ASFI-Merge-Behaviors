ask is that \r\n1. If default list of stop words are used during ingestion, remove the default list of stop words from the query during query time\r\n2. If stop words all stop words are excluded, we should not remove any stop words from the query\r\n3. If a customized list of stop words are excluded, only remove the customized list of stop words from the query\r\n\r\nCurrently, stop words are not removed from query at all which means if query contains stop words, the query will not match any results. To give you a concrete example, let's use the input example provided in Pinot's [documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/text-search-support#resume-text) with default text-index ingestion configs:\r\n> Distributed systems, Java, C++, Go, distributed query engines for analytics and data warehouses, Machine learning, spark, Kubernetes, transaction processing, Java, Python, C++, Machine learning, building and deploying large scale... CUDA, GPU processing, Tensor flow ...\r\n\r\nWith the above input, the following query from Pinot's documentation would return a match: \r\n```\r\nSELECT SKILLS_COL \r\nFROM MyTable \r\nWHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '\"Machine learning\" AND \"gpu processing\"')\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the following query would not return any match for the same input because the query contains the stop words `for` and `and`\r\n```\r\nSELECT SKILLS_COL \r\nFROM MyTable \r\nWHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '\"query engines for analytics\" AND \"building and deploying\"')\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoving the stop words from the query should allow queries to return results\r\n```\r\nSELECT SKILLS_COL \r\nFROM MyTable \r\nWHERE TEXT_MATCH(SKILLS_COL, '\"query engines analytics\" AND \"building deploying\"')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current workaround for this bug is either to remove the stop words from the query externally or disable stop words entirely. If there's no plan to fix this bug, we should modify this claim in the Pinot [documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/text-search-support#text-parsing-and-tokenization): \r\n> Any occurrence of these words in will be ignored by the tokenizer during index creation and *search*.\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n> Any occurrence of these words in will be ignored by the tokenizer during index creation but not during *search*.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1591126575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1591327123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10899#issuecomment-1591327123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10899","id":1591327123,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5e2bmT","user":{"login":"zhuangdaz","id":8186420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODY0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8186420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuangdaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangdaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-14T14:25:33Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T14:25:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KKcorps could you help take a look please?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1591327123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1591501069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10912#issuecomment-1591501069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10912","id":1591501069,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5e3GEN","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-14T15:38:45Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T15:38:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We did consider.

Keep in mind that we haven't yet added support for function arguments as literals etc which are heavily used for some of our aggregation functions (and this will be done as part of phase 2). Due to this we cannot yet support functions such as `distinctCountHLL` (as you asked for in another comment). In these two PRs we've only added support for all functions which are already supported in v2 today. In phase 2 we will tackle functions like `distinctCountHLL` and if you prefer we can keep the list of functions very short to ensure easier code reviews.\r\n\r\nThe [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Us6aBvTpNLMEy0ODo34OgTk73h_LVFFAH6q17689h1M/edit?usp=sharing) actually has an Appendix which lists out all the non-MV aggregation functions and their properties (what arguments they take, what their intermediate and final types are, etc). That can help get a sense for the various categories of aggregation functions in v1 today and can make the phases we've discussed a bit clearer.\r\n\r\nYes, you should pick both PRs and merge them. Merging together may not be enough, since this PR creates a new aggregation operator. A small code change will be required to call the aggregation operator in this PR rather than the existing `AggregateOperator`.

For example training of LLM on text can produce billions of vector embeddings which are the distilled representation of text / words (training data). Goal is to build optimal storage, indexing and query execution capabilities for such kind of data.\r\n\r\n**Benefit / Use Case**\r\n\r\nCan be a crucial foundation for AI systems that can leverage high performance similarity indexing and analytics on vector embeddings for recommendation, image matching, pattern recognition, anomaly detection etc. \r\n\r\nSpecifically in the case of LLMs and prompt engineering pipeline - vector storage, indexing and querying can be used to store and query domain specific facts (that were created during training e.g neural network learning) which can then be fed into NLP models / ChatBots, Conversational Prompts etc

Similarity-based vector indexing/search, a crucial element of these systems, identifies 'close' vectors in this space, signifying high similarity. This is commonly achieved through calculating the cosine similarity or Euclidean distance between vectors.\r\n\r\nFor instance, (1) in recommendation systems, items similar to a user's past interests are identified and suggested. (2) Meanwhile in LLM applications, instead of submitting a customer’s prompt directly to model, the question is first routed to the vector database (can be considered as the memory of the LLM), which will retrieve the top 10 or 15 most relevant documents for that query. The vector database then bundles those supporting documents with the user’s original question, submits the full package as the knowledge context prompt to the LLM, which returns more relevant answer. (https://mlops.community/combine-and-query-multiple-documents-with-llm/, https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/MilvusIndexDemo.html)\r\n\r\nHowever, given the potentially vast number of vectors, searching for the most similar ones can be computationally challenging. Therefore, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms like FAISS, Annoy, or ScaNN are employed to expedite this process by quickly finding the nearest vectors in high-dimensional spaces.\r\n\r\nhttps://milvus.io/docs/index.md\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss\r\n\r\nhttps://www.datanami.com/2023/03/27/vector-databases-emerge-to-fill-critical-role-in-ai/\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/linkedin/venice#read-compute","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1593447601/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1593475379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10919#issuecomment-1593475379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10919","id":1593475379,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5e-oEz","user":{"login":"Aravind-Suresh","id":9376723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNzY3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9376723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh","html_url":"https://github.com/Aravind-Suresh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aravind-Suresh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-15T17:31:33Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T17:31:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the inputs @siddharthteotia @jasperjiaguo - yes, given the high dimensionality of the embeddings (OpenAI-davinci embeddings are >12k in dimensions), it's practical to use approximate algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to recommendation systems and vector-search based prompts, there are also applications in semantic searches, clustering (grouping of related issues, text) as well.\r\n\r\nWe recently tried powering automated Q&A via vector-search (using vector search based prompts) and it achieves good precision on unstructured data input as well (we used langchain here -

Definitely leverage existing libraries to no re-invent the wheel. \r\n\r\nDuring Index build phase, we need to build per segment basis SPTAG index. Use hierarchical balanced clustering to generate a set of regions(centroids).\r\nWe can configure below two parameters:\r\n- Number of regions or the percentage of total points are centroids(number of regions). From paper, 16% for best for search performance and memory usage\r\n- Replicas for a vector assigned to multiple closed clusters, larger number means better recall but search requires more resources and longer latency. From paper, 8 is best to balance perf and latency.
