Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574878742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574885270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6792#issuecomment-574885270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6792","id":574885270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDg4NTI3MA==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T22:23:41Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T22:23:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tests aren't quite passing -- one failure due to a non-fixed ordering of return values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574885270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574886874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7157#issuecomment-574886874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7157","id":574886874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDg4Njg3NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T22:28:16Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T22:28:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7157?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`master@92521aa`).

This is how - deeply asynchronous - the process of community-driven project is. There is no \"your team\" here - there are individual contributors and committers and even individual PMC members that are working mostly in their spare time and find the time outside of their normal work, at the expense of their families and personal time to review and comment on other's code and make it \"ready\" to submit. So there is no \"your team\" here. There are individual people. And sometimes they have other obligations and are simply swamped with their regular job so things usually take longer than in a \"commercial\" setting. \r\n\r\nYet we have much higher requirements (tests, documentation, quality of code, good architecture) precisely because we have no formal structure and no way to divide responsibilities - we have to make sure the code can be picked up by anyone, anytime and it is fully covered by automated tests.\r\n\r\nI often have PRs opened for weeks or even months until I have time and got enough feedback and buy-in from others to be ready to merge - especially if a commit is big. And sometimes my idea is ahead of its time and it has to wait for months (even years) to be finally implemented (happened to me!). And I am humble enough and persistent enough to continue rebasing my code - because I understand others cannot just stop their work while the iterations happen. Sometimes rebasing 30-40 times. And I am trying to not be bitter about it - I try to be empathic about it and understand that there are people - not machines on the other side. Actually the strategy I use - is to rebase often to avoid one big rebase. It makes it so much easier. And rebasing is usually easy - especially that you get conflicts ONLY about the files that you touched as well. You do not need to understand the whole codebase. I can really recommend tools lik IntelliJ/PyCharm - they have fantastic support for solving conflicts and usually it is very easy. And only you can do it I am afraid. And it will happen - because other people work in parallel. That's just a reality of the project.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of people would like to see singularity support and after initial slow uptick it seems that it's time came. This also means that you will get a lot of comments, and you will have to meet the quality bar to get merged and sometimes people will have different opinion and you will have to find consensus.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575146487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575161505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7088#issuecomment-575161505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7088","id":575161505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTE2MTUwNQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T13:54:34Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T13:54:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Would it be too much to ask for a test covering this scenario of refresh (mocking Paramiko)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575161505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575169715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7160#issuecomment-575169715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7160","id":575169715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTE2OTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T14:14:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T14:14:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So just update the json @lokeshlal.

This is how - deeply asynchronous - the process of community-driven project is. There is no \"your team\" here - there are individual contributors and committers and even individual PMC members that are working mostly in their spare time and find the time outside of their normal work, at the expense of their families and personal time to review and comment on other's code and make it \"ready\" to submit. So there is no \"your team\" here. There are individual people. And sometimes they have other obligations and are simply swamped with their regular job so things usually take longer than in a \"commercial\" setting.\r\n\r\nThis is completely understandable, and the norm for most open source projects that don't have some company (or similar) backing. The feedback I'd give is that regardless of an individual being a maintainer or an actual team, a new contributor should be welcomed and supported throughout the process. It's the individuals of any project doing the reviewing that really make or break the culture.\r\n\r\n> Yet we have much higher requirements (tests, documentation, quality of code, good architecture) precisely because we have no formal structure and no way to divide responsibilities - we have to make sure the code can be picked up by anyone, anytime and it is fully covered by automated tests.\r\n\r\nAlso understandable, and in this case, as a new contributor, it would be helpful to have someone give guidance about what needs to be done, tested, etc. \r\n\r\n> I often have PRs opened for weeks or even months until I have time and got enough feedback and buy-in from others to be ready to merge - especially if a commit is big. And sometimes my idea is ahead of its time and it has to wait for months (even years) to be finally implemented (happened to me!). And I am humble enough and persistent enough to continue rebasing my code - because I understand others cannot just stop their work while the iterations happen. Sometimes rebasing 30-40 times. \r\n\r\n30-40 times seems a big excessive, but I don't want to judge. It seems like there should be better organization around at least setting expectations for contribution. In my case, I neither knew what to do, I didn't feel empowered to do anything, and I didn't understand the architecture well enough or have enough experience with the community to know what I was supposed to do.\r\n\r\n> And I am trying to not be bitter about it - I try to be empathic about it and understand that there are people - not machines on the other side. Actually the strategy I use - is to rebase often to avoid one big rebase. It makes it so much easier. And rebasing is usually easy - especially that you get conflicts ONLY about the files that you touched as well. You do not need to understand the whole codebase. I can really recommend tools lik IntelliJ/PyCharm - they have fantastic support for solving conflicts and usually it is very easy. And only you can do it I am afraid. And it will happen - because other people work in parallel. That's just a reality of the project.\r\n\r\nYes, and to this point I'd say touche - there are people on the other side that aren't bitter, but need guidance. I've been an open source developer for over a decade and I'm well aware about rebasing, but more importantly, people and communities feel very differently about it. The sentiment here seems to be that it's in favor, but the communication was poor so the final result is a mess.\r\n\r\n> I think a lot of people would like to see singularity support and after initial slow uptick it seems that it's time came. This also means that you will get a lot of comments, and you will have to meet the quality bar to get merged and sometimes people will have different opinion and you will have to find consensus.\r\n\r\nYes, and I would also need guidance from somewhere about what needs to be fixed, how to update the PR, otherwise it's just confusing.\r\n\r\nI feel like you are taking the defense here, and I certainly didn't do anything wrong, so I want to offer a clean slate and suggest that discussion stop being focused around who is at fault and why, and how we can move forward to fix this. Currently there is a publication out with misleading / incorrect information and I'd suggest that effort is put into fixing that. \r\n\r\nI will take the initiative and re-open the PR against the current version, and I look forward to better interactions with the _individuals_ in your community.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575240752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575254776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7141#issuecomment-575254776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7141","id":575254776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTI1NDc3Ng==","user":{"login":"larryzhu2018","id":44448956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDQ4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44448956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018","html_url":"https://github.com/larryzhu2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larryzhu2018/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T17:18:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T17:18:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> * g another ticket?\r\nPlease see the test case, I need the index parameter so that I can ensure there is only one log line in the index and I use a separate index for that.

to make sure we understand each other - I am not defensive, I really try to understand and put in actions some of the things that can make our community more welcoming. I understand your experience is not good with this PR, so I really want to find out and get some ideas on what we can do better (or maybe give you some information you missed that we already changed). As you will see below - we are really open to that and I particularly am very interested in that.\r\n\r\n> Also understandable, and in this case, as a new contributor, it would be helpful to have someone give guidance about what needs to be done, tested, etc.\r\n\r\nI perfectly understand that part. Actually you might want to take a look at the thread I started recently titled \"Being even more welcoming community?\" at our devlist:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/aa6006ae051a406b0dfe20297407efd2ddf1337293b33fdda4c8f5fd%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nWe specifically talked there about need for some mentorship approach where more experienced community members could mentor the new ones and answer the questions. We also have slack where people ask questions (and other people - often committers are responding) and devlist in general. \r\n\r\nSo what do you think in general we could do better here? What would help you as a new committer?\r\n\r\nI would really encourage you to join the devlist thread about \"Being more welcoming\") and voice your concerns there. I really want to understand what your expectations are for that other than what is currently there. Any ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\n> 30-40 times seems a big excessive, but I don't want to judge. \r\n\r\nWell. Few years ago I've learned (from a person I value a lot) one of the best quotes:\r\n\"If there is something that is painful - start doing it more often\". It is a counter-intuitive but brilliant advice in many things in IT - doing builds, releasing etc. This is very same thing with rebases - the more often you do them, the less painful they are and the better you learn how to do them in least painful way. That's why for me 30-40 is not a lot because I sometimes do it daily And it works beautifully because at most I have one-two-conflicts to solve that are easy/obvious.\r\n\r\n> It seems like there should be better organization around at least setting expectations for contribution. In my case, I neither knew what to do, I didn't feel empowered to do anything, and I didn't understand the architecture well enough or have enough experience with the community to know what I was supposed to do.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that you are referring to Airflow as it was 10 months ago when you started it. And gee how we've changed since. Let me just ask you a few questions:\r\n- Do you know we have updated \"Pull Request guidelines\" which describe the requirements for contribution in fairly short but comprehensive way? https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines ?\r\n\r\n- Do you know that we have a detailed \"new contributor's\" workflow in our CONTRIBUTING.rst documentation where we graphically describe how the process look like, where we explain that you should involve and discuss with community, be persistent: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-workflow-example ?\r\n\r\n- Do you know that we have \"First time contributor's workshops\" - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/First+time+contributor%27s+workshop where we encourage people to work together with commiters and learn how to contribute, what are the requirements and they have a chance to do so. We've already run 3 of those and we are discussing 5 more. \r\n\r\n- Do you know that we have a \"Breeze\" development environment that aims to be up-and-running in less than 10 minutes and allows you to quickly run any of the tests without a hassle of configure your local environment? https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst\r\n\r\n- Do you know that we have a detailed \"Testing\" document that describes how to test Airflow - including integration tests, Kubernetes tests, backend-specific tests:  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/TESTING.rst\r\n\r\nI would really love to understand it - whether you simply had your knowledge about our guides/processes back from 10 months ago, or maybe you knew all those resources and they were not helpful? And ideally - if you know what exactly could help you - I would love if you write it in the devlist thread:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/aa6006ae051a406b0dfe20297407efd2ddf1337293b33fdda4c8f5fd%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\n> Yes, and to this point I'd say touche - there are people on the other side that aren't bitter, but need guidance. I've been an open source developer for over a decade and I'm well aware about rebasing, but more importantly, people and communities feel very differently about it. The sentiment here seems to be that it's in favor, but the communication was poor so the final result is a mess.\r\n\r\nI would really love to hear what could be improved in the communication. For now I hear there were delays and stalling (which is unfortunate, but hard for me to apologise for others who participated in that). On the other hand - it's really responsibility of the author to remind and call out if they feel their job is stalled. This might happen simply by overlook and just a friendly \"ping\", \"can you please take a look - I am waiting for your feedback\" is the best way to ping committers. We are usually busy and have not only yours but 10s of other commits to look after. We also wrote it in the CONTRIBUTIBUTING.rst \"Ping @ #development slack, comment @people. Be annoying. Be considerate.\". \r\n\r\n> Yes, and I would also need guidance from somewhere about what needs to be fixed, how to update the PR, otherwise it's just confusing.\r\n\r\nI think once you rebase it - you will get it. Simply make a comment and @ people that commented your request and then \"Be annoying, be considerate\". Just be empathetic as well and understand that we get 100s of emails a day and we look through 10s of PRs, so we really look only at the PRs that have no conflicts and are \"travis green\". The main reason for all the automation we've implemented recently is to decrease the burden on reviewers. Now when we see \"green\" checkmark on PR is a sign for us that \"basic requirements\" are met - and then we can proceed to review.\r\n \r\n> I feel like you are taking the defense here, and I certainly didn't do anything wrong, so I want to offer a clean slate and suggest that discussion stop being focused around who is at fault and why, and how we can move forward to fix this. Currently there is a publication out with misleading / incorrect information and I'd suggest that effort is put into fixing that.\r\n\r\nI never pointed out any faults in my message and never said or suggested you were wrong. I just tried to be informative. As mentioned in my \"Being even more welcoming community?\" I specifically asked for concrete feedback and information 0 on what we can improve and how. In this context - What publication exactly you mean? I am not sure what exactly you refer to.\r\n \r\n> I will take the initiative and re-open the PR against the current version, and I look forward to better interactions with the _individuals_ in your community.\r\n\r\nThanks! yes I think it's really good idea.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575337231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575354949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4846#issuecomment-575354949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4846","id":575354949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTM1NDk0OQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T21:27:36Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T21:27:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One more thing: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6556 - in this issue we started (yesterday) gather information from the users on what could be improved in our docs.

me guide you on this @abdulbasitds -> I think it is great to learn how to rebase in git :). I will soon put that into contributor's documentation (this is a common question - how to rebase) but I'd love if you tell me it is descriptive enough/easy to follow:\r\n\r\nFirst of all - you can read about rebase workflow here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing - this is an excellent article that describes all ins/outs of rebase. I recommend reading it and keeping it as reference.\r\n\r\nThe goal of rebasing your PR on top of `apache/master` is to \"transplant\" your change on top of the latest changes that are merged by others and that changes from your PR do not conflict with those changes from others.\r\n\r\nHere is how rebase looks in practice:\r\n\r\n1. You need to add Apache remote to your git repository. I usually add it as \"apache\" remote so that i can refer to it easily: \r\n`git remote add apache git@github.com:apache/airflow.git` or\r\n`git remote add apache https://github.com/apache/airflow.git` if you use https\r\n\r\n2. You need to make sure that you have the latest master fetched from all remotes:\r\n`git fetch --all`. You want to rebase your changes on top of `apache/master` branch.\r\n\r\n3. Assuming that your feature is in a branch in your repository called `my-branch` you can check easily what is the base commit you should rebase from\r\n`git merge-base my-branch apache/master` \r\nThis will return you base commit which you should use to rebase your feature - for example: `5abce471e0690c6b8d06ca25685b0845c5fd270f`\r\n\r\n4. Make sure you checked out your branch locally:\r\n`git checkout my-branch`\r\n\r\n5. Rebase: \r\n`git rebase HASH_ID --onto apache/master`\r\nfor example: \r\n`git rebase 5abce471e0690c6b8d06ca25685b0845c5fd270f --onto apache/master`\r\n\r\n6. If you have no conflicts - that's cool. You rebased. You can run `git push --force-with-lease` to push your changes to your repository. That should trigger the build in Travis if you have a Pull Request opened already.\r\n\r\n7. While rebasing you might have conflicts. Read carefully what git tells you when it tells you about the conflicts. You need to solve the conflicts manually. This is sometimes the most difficult part and requires deliberate correcting your code looking what has changed since you developed your changes. There are various tools that can help you with that. You can use\r\n`git mergetool` (and you can configure different merge tools. Also you can use IntelliJ/PyCharm excellent merge tool. When you open project in PyCharm which has conflict you can go to VCS->Git->Resolve Conflicts and ther you have one of the most intuitive and nice merge tools I ever used. You can see there https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/resolving-conflicts.html.\r\n\r\n8. After you solved conflicts simply run `git rebase --continue` and go either to point 6. or 7. above depending if you have more commits that cause conflicts in your PR (rebasing applies each commit from your PR one-by-one).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575881530/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/575881629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6007#issuecomment-575881629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6007","id":575881629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTg4MTYyOQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-18T09:18:45Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T09:18:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please let me know @abdulbasitds if it's helpful/easy to follow -
