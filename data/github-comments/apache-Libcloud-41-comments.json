Although seeing that the tests rely on saved responses I see your point.  Is there any sort of integration tests that are triggerable that run the \"real\" api.\r\nAlso is there any documentation as to how to generate the responses that are saved and used in the test?  I can imagine that some have them have changed over the years (similar to the object storage api here where all tests passed before this pull request but the real world api broke anyway).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/385717591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/385719711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1207#issuecomment-385719711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1207","id":385719711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTcxOTcxMQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T16:43:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T16:43:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#1207](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207?src=pr&el=desc) into [trunk](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/commit/c58e89222c34849b51ae698e26ea027f887ea024?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207/graphs/tree.svg?src=pr&token=PYoduksh69&width=650&height=150)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##            trunk    #1207      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   86.21%   86.21%   +<.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         348      348              \n  Lines       67381    67385       +4     \n  Branches     5963     5965       +2     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        58095    58099       +4     \n  Misses       6853     6853              \n  Partials     2433     2433\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [libcloud/compute/drivers/ec2.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvY29tcHV0ZS9kcml2ZXJzL2VjMi5weQ==) | `74.06% <0%> (-0.2%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [libcloud/test/compute/test\\_ec2.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9jb21wdXRlL3Rlc3RfZWMyLnB5) | `97.93% <0%> (+0.15%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/test/compute/test\\_upcloud.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9jb21wdXRlL3Rlc3RfdXBjbG91ZC5weQ==) | `91.39% <0%> (+1.32%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1207?src=pr&el=footer).
