thanks for the explanation. If I understand correctly, couldn't we handle negative entries in `squeeze_compiler` without changing the topi implementation at all?

I can kick-start with a vector-add example, if nobody is going to do it. Recently I've studied how exactly python and c++ interop works (without using pybind or Boost Python etc). It would be interesting to write about it too.\r\n\r\nBelow are things which I think should be documented:\r\n* How to add a new backend. Recently I was asked about this, but I couldn't point to a relevant document. \r\n* How the TOPI target dispatching mechanism works\r\n\r\nBelow are things I'm not familiar with. I appreciate if somebody can write about them.\r\n* Relay IR design, motivation, compilation mechanism etc. How it relates to traditional computational graph representation. (They are discussed on Github, but not documented.)\r\n* TVM IR lowering process. How initial Realize/Provide stuff gets transformed into a low level IR. How bounds inference works.
