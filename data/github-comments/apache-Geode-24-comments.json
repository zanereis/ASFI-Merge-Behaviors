The gist as I see it is that when reviewing the history of code changes (i.e. `git blame` or equivalent) that reviewing the commit logs should provide enough without having to flip back and forth between browsing JIRA and the IDE or git log.\r\n\r\nFor this case I think something like \"Use values large enough (> 8 bytes) to force off-heap storage\" would fit the bill for this simple change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/421098033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/421105685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2463#issuecomment-421105685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2463","id":421105685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTEwNTY4NQ==","user":{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-13T18:26:22Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T18:26:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@upthewaterspout
