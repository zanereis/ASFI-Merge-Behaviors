Didn't think about using it within the same DAG. Thx. Will try that out. I am running hourly, so I could set the execution delta to `hours=1`. Is the execution delta a minimum requirement or a maximum requirement? In other words, does at least 1 hour difference need to occur for the trigger to fire? Or does the trigger fire up until a max difference of 1 hour occurs?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/165015822/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/165142341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/752#issuecomment-165142341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/752","id":165142341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTE0MjM0MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-16T15:28:57Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T15:28:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Logging is still busted in master.

Once you've created that first user, you can then create other users via the web interface.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\n$ cd ~/airflow\n$ python\nPython 2.7.9 (default, Feb 10 2015, 03:28:08) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.56)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import airflow\n>>> from airflow import models, settings\n>>> from airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth import PasswordUser\n>>> user = PasswordUser(models.User())\n>>> user.username = 'new_user_name'\n>>> user.email = 'new_user_email@example.com'\n>>> user.password = 'set_the_password'\n>>> session = settings.Session()\n>>> session.add(user)\n>>> session.commit()\n>>> session.close()\n>>> exit()\n```\n\nI'll write these instructions in the documentation. I originally thought of creating a new user with a password in the migrations but I didn't want to have the risk of developers installing airflow and not deleting that default account.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/165212240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/165221081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/769#issuecomment-165221081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/769","id":165221081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTIyMTA4MQ==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-16T19:28:22Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T19:28:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"May I ask which version of airflow you are using?

I think that's happening because airflow is configuring logging in two places. Is that necessary?\n\nWe've iterated a lot on our logging, and ended up implementing something similar to this: http://victorlin.me/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python. It now works very well, although took a while to get there. The key issues were to isolate what we wanted to change (i.e. don't touch the root logger, decide whether you want to set handlers or leave that up to the user, etc), and have a single place to set the logging config. \n\nOver the holidays I could have a go at implementing this is airflow. @mistercrunch let me know if that would be congruent with airflow goals and whether you have any high level requirements. \n\nOne thing to note: we currently implement the logging config in a YAML file. The `fileConfig` (which is the format airflow's config currently uses) for logging has less functionality than the `dictConfig` (which can take a YAML or JSON file).

At Agari, we use local executors and run a single scheduler with local executors as well as the webserver on the same (single) EC2 instance. \n\nLet's also say that your dag_id is `my_first_dag_v1`. You can always wipe out your old DAG and its history while simultaneously importing a new DAG by 1) changing `my_first_dag_v1` to `my_first_dag_v2` in your `my_first_dag.py` file and 2) restarting both webserver and scheduler. The result will be a new DAG with no history and the name of the DAG (i.e. the dag_id) will now be `my_first_dag_v2`.\n\nIf you ever want to change the name of a DAG file, then you should change both the dag_id and the DAG file name. If you just change the DAG file name, but keep the dag_id the same, there will be a problem. \n\nSo, in the example above, your new file and dag_id could be `blah_blah_dag.py` and `blah_blah_dag_v1`, respectively. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/166765979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/166766363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/799#issuecomment-166766363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/799","id":166766363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Njc2NjM2Mw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-23T00:11:31Z","updated_at":"2015-12-23T00:11:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Try `airflow clear data_pipeline -s 2015-10-22 -e 2015-10-22` if you just want to clear one day.
