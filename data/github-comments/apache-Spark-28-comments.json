Andre, I haven't had a chance to look at this closely, but I do really like the idea of this functionality. Some thoughts:\n- Right now it looks like this is exposing catalyst `DataType` to end users.  While this maybe okay, the original intention was to keep the catalyst API purely internal to leave things flexible in the future.  Therefore, we may want to create wrapper classes in the public API that don't expose so many details (for example dataTypes have ClassTags that talk about the underlying JVM datatype that we use during execution).  Another option (maybe in addition to a programatic api) would be use use HiveQL strings to describe schema (there is already a converter).  At the very least we need to mark this method experimental though.  A task for me right now is to create a Java API for Spark SQL, and part of this will be deciding how to expose schema to end users.\n- I looked the test that is failing.  I'm confused how `InsertIntoParquetTable` is sneaking into the Hive test cases.  Is something getting mixed up during analysis?  Are we just failing to reset some state in the reset function of TestHive?\n- The above aside, I think the issue here is the second parameter list to `InsertIntoParquetTable`.  It is correct to keep the spark context in the second list so it is not consider part of the case class as far as equality is concerned, but arguments in other parameter lists are not included in the 'magic' tree copying and so need to be added manually `override def otherCopyArgs = sc :: Nil`.\n- You may already handle these cases correctly, but a few things that came to mind.\n  - What happens to existing RDDs when a table is appended to?  Is there an a case when recomputing will rescan the directory looking for files and cause the RDD to change?  Will this always happen?\n  - What happens if multiple users append to a parquet \"table\", stored on HDFS for example, at the same time?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38324790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38326590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/198#issuecomment-38326590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/198","id":38326590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzI2NTkw","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-21T21:34:31Z","updated_at":"2014-03-21T21:34:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

Have others seen examples of exceptions in the DAGScheduler that we can recover from?\n\nI filed the JIRA leading to this change because a PythonAccumulator was throwing a SparkException (exposing this DAGScheduler issue).  I originally tried to fix the handling of this exception (see https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-1290) but the exception gets thrown when the Python Spark Context gets disconnected from the Scala Spark Context -- so I don't think the problem can be recovered from.  In other words, for that case, I think it makes most sense to just die, because we're never going to make forward progress.\n\nI'm also concerned that we can never completely clean up after an error like this.  For example, what if the exception gets thrown at the end of handling a task completion, where a job has already been marked as finished.  Then when we cancel the job, we'll end up with a bunch of duplicate messages.  I think I'm in favor of a solution where we fail the DAGScheduler on an exception, and then catch the recoverable exceptions in the appropriate place lower down in the code, where we can appropriately clean up the state.\n\nCurious to hear what others' thoughts are here...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38336673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38336867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/201#issuecomment-38336867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/201","id":38336867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzM2ODY3","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-22T00:05:37Z","updated_at":"2014-03-22T00:05:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can
