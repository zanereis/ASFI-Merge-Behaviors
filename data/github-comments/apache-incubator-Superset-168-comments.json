I agree that this might seem excessive, but let me explain the reasoning behind the changes:\r\n\r\nThe main argument is that `viz.py` should be independent of database type. In order to achieve this, any column names or labels in `query_obj` need to be in their original format. Let's assume that we have a metric with the label `SUM(col)`. In the case of Redshift and BigQuery these would cause the following:\r\n- **Redshift**: the resulting dataframe will contain a column called `sum(col)` (gets automatically mutated by the database)\r\n- **Bigquery**: will fail unless the label is mutated.\r\n\r\nCurrently (in `master`) BigQuery solves this by replacing the parens with underscores, resulting in a column called `SUM_col_`. Aside from the mostly theoretical risk of collisions, this introduces a discrepancy between the dataframe and `form_data`/`query_obj`. Furthermore, the mapping from metric name to verbose name used by all charts doesn't work (`data.verbose_map` in `/connectors/base/models.py`) unless that is also made aware of the new mutated labels. The way I see it there are two ways around this:\r\n1) Either the columns in the dataframe returned by `/connectors/sqla/models.py` need to be renamed to their original state prior to being passed to their respective Viz, or\r\n2) The Viz need to be aware that some labels have changed (in this case `SUM_col_` actually refers to `SUM(col)`).\r\n\r\nWhat this PR attempts to do is move from 2) to 1), i.e. encapsulate all SQLA specific logic in `/connectors/sqla/models.py`. In this proposal this has been done by pushing around a dict that collects all mutated labels in a dict, and renames the dataframe columns to their original state prior to being returned. I agree that this looks clumsy, but seemed like the best solution at the time. This can probably be refactored to something more maintainable/understandable. Where this approach adds complexity to SQLA models logic, this decouples Viz logic completely from the database backend, which I think is a good thing.\r\n\r\nWhile it might appear excessively complicated, I think the heterogeneous nature of the SQLA ecosystem seems to require a lot of flexibility from the backend to be able to conform to the quirks of every individual engine. However, if this still feels like the wrong approach I am open to suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/420526165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/420528455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4663#issuecomment-420528455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4663","id":420528455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDUyODQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"congdanh8391","id":38421401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDIxNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38421401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391","html_url":"https://github.com/congdanh8391","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congdanh8391/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T06:32:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T06:32:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @mistercrunch @michellethomas thanks for the reviews!

Given @mistercrunch comments above, I assume existed filter_box viz type will keep working as it, and will introduce new filter component lived inside dashboard. So there will be two types of filters working together.\r\n\r\n- Scoped filter\r\n   - Filter should be visible (scroll up/down is ok, but not extra tab switch) when it is applicable to any charts.  \r\n   - Top level filters: \r\nFilter is placed in dashboard without tab, or at top section of dashboard with row-level tabs. So that filters are always visible in the dashboard. \r\nTop level filters will apply to all charts in the dashboard.\r\n  - Tab level filters:\r\nTab level filters are placed inside a Tab component. As long as the tab component is visible, filters will apply to all charts in the same tab.\r\n\r\n- Easy UI for user to see which charts are affected by which filter, and easy add immune from the filter.\r\n- Easy UI to group multiple filters, and allow user define cascade filters.\r\nCurrent filters are filter_box that generated from explore view, so each of filter_box (can have multiple dropdowns) contains one slice of constraint, whereas dashboard may have multiple filter_boxes to add many constrains. If this is the case, i see our users always update one filter_box in dashboard, apply it, wait all charts in dashboard finished loading, then update another filter_box, wait another round of loading...It is very frustrating in daily use. \r\n<br/>So I am thinking dashboard should allow user group a few filter_boxes(and native filter components) together, in which user can update each filter but don't trigger dashboard level loading events. In the group user can also make cascade filters (where one filter react on other filters's selected values). And in the end user can apply all selected values altogether in 1 dashboard level load. This will greatly improve the dashboard filters usability.\r\n\r\n- After user update filter and trigger the dashboard level refresh, can we have UI indicator showing filter is applying or done? Some of our dashboard is crazy big so it's hard to scroll back and forward to check if every chart is ready  😓\r\n\r\n- Keep filters state in URL parameter [#5374]\r\nIf user applied filter in dashboard, can we update dashboard's url parameter (or anywhere as a state of history), like url for explore view? So that when user refresh dashboard, the previously applied filters are still be memorized. \r\nDashboard should not automatically save filter parameter unless user saved them as default_filter metadata.\r\n\r\n- Coordinate `Visual Correlation` feature. Discussed in another thread, @JamshedRahman want to introduce a new feature that allow one chart to publish events to dashboard level, and all other charts in the dashboard that are listening to the events can change/react accordingly. These 2 features will implemented independently, but i just feel there might be some common logic to share. \r\n\r\nThese are all proposals. I would like to leave @xtinec who implements this feature to decide final list. Thank you!!\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/420741116/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/420757906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5865#issuecomment-420757906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5865","id":420757906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc1NzkwNg==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:50:20Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T18:50:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@conglei tried to fix the js test that failed your build in #5874 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/420757906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/420764501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5874#issuecomment-420764501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5874","id":420764501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc2NDUwMQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T19:12:19Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T19:12:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5874?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5874](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5874?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/367dcdaa7de04bb281df6a59926cefa7ec1794a1?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5874/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5874?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #5874   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   63.73%   63.73%           \n=======================================\n  Files         374      374           \n  Lines       23328    23328           \n  Branches     2608     2608           \n=======================================\n  Hits        14869    14869           \n  Misses       8446     8446           \n  Partials       13       13\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5874?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5874?src=pr&el=footer).
