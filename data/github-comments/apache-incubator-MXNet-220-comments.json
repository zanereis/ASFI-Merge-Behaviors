Also, Gluon abstracts away NDArray and Symbol wherever possible, which means that tools that conform to the standard will be usable in both NDArray and Symbol, thus benefiting all use cases. Having it as standalone means that someone has to merge it to master from time to time, and it can mean more time-consuming process (at least 2 PRs in two places to get a bug fixed and to have users pick it up).
