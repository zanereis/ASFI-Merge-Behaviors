For posterity, here's what I did:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPATH=\"/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH\" ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/opt/openssl --with-boost=/usr/local --without-lua --without-csharp --without-c_glib --without-erlang --without-php --without-cpp --without-haskell\r\nmake -j3 precross\r\ntest/test.py --server rb --client nodejs\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter doing that, the tests that use a `BufferedTransport` on the Ruby server side fail. Since I'm only dealing with Ruby on the client side in my usage, I didn't realize that `BufferedTransport` can be used to wrap a server socket as well (this is what the Ruby `TestServer.rb` is doing when testing a buffered transport).\r\n\r\nThe issue stems from my misunderstanding of the semantics of `#flush`. In the nodejs -> Ruby cross test, I think the node client writes multiple requests to the socket before the Ruby server responds to any of them. The Ruby server calls `#flush` after each response to flush the write buffer, but my change drops the read buffer as well, discarding the buffered requests before they've been processed.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this and think about whether there's a better way to accomplish what I'm after.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/331609585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/331620381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1313#issuecomment-331620381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1313","id":331620381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTYyMDM4MQ==","user":{"login":"xiaohu-zhang","id":26646273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQ2Mjcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26646273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaohu-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohu-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-23T08:41:01Z","updated_at":"2017-09-23T08:41:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you ! honestly speaking , netty and lots of framework implementing this fix.

In fact I see it failing everytime and this is why I didn't set your protocol recommendations. \r\n\r\nLet me explain. When a multiX server is set, the processor allows you to register several processors. Each of this processors can implement different services. If you are contacting with a binary client (not multi) when you send the message it's not prefixed by the service name. It means that at the server end the server will never know what's the destination processor for that request. \r\n\r\nSo when you use a binary client, you must use a binary server. And with the multi happens the same.\r\n\r\nApart from this, the protocol is implemented, my problem is that I was confused with the protocols in the json file and I don't know what should I really enable...\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides this I ran it manually against binary multi client and ran ok. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/335045091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/335045280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1361#issuecomment-335045280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1361","id":335045280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTA0NTI4MA==","user":{"login":"gadLinux","id":233204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzIwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux","html_url":"https://github.com/gadLinux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-08T23:02:55Z","updated_at":"2017-10-08T23:02:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What I'm thinking looking at Java implementation is that on c_glib we can set a property in the processor to define what's the default handler to be get in case of a not multi client.
