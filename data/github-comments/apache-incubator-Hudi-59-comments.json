At first sight we thought that the problem was due this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4753. Indeed, the problem could be addressed by the fact that we're using transactional producers, and offsets in Kafka with transactional producers have different meaning and some of them can be used to handle transactions. This offset usage is probably the thing that makes our consumers hanging up in the \"last run\" due to the fact that the ending offset is not reachable. So this problem probably relates to this.

I'm not very inclined to use reflection with try-catch here since it's not a clear indication of Hive 3.x support.\r\n\r\nHi @n3nash, we internally have a Hudi branch to support Hive 3.x & Hadoop 3.x, basically what we do is first fix API level conflict and then fix dependency level conflict. This PR is like a prerequisite for the support of Hive 3.x. \r\nMy idea is instead of creating a big pull request to include all the changes to support Hadoop 3 & Hive 3 in one PR, I am trying to split my code changes into several small commits. Like this PR only resolve [HUDI-515] issue.\r\nWhat's your idea?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/629990534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/630072442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1639#issuecomment-630072442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1639","id":630072442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDA3MjQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-18T09:47:46Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T09:47:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bvaradar  `hudi-integ-test` also does not list the rat plugin..

Hudi as you know has to be dropped under many different services (hive/spark/presto,...) and guava as universal it is, presents a jar conflict nightmare... \r\n\r\nOn the re-using code itself, i know we have done this in few places in the past. but, this often leads to maintenance issues more often than not... we change the re-used code, people fix the original code.. and overtime we don't invest in getting upstream bug fixes etc.. So for small stuff like this, I prefer that we write it ourselves.. \r\n\r\nIs this the original [code](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.java) ? I would say if we are trimming down that file and using some parts verbatim, we are still reusing code.. (which I think is what we are doing)\r\n\r\nThe act of adding new things to LICENSE/NOTICE is not that straightforward, given we don't have an entry for guava yet.. We need to examine, guava's NOTICE, its dependencies etc..
