Theoretically, it is possible to replace the application server (currently Jetty). But I don't know anyone who really does that. Nevertheless, it is important to me that we only use standardized configurations and do not rely on deep Jetty functions.\r\n\r\nBut I've already learned about some of the disadvantages. Maybe it makes sense to merge the two modules here. Even if this will certainly not be easy.\r\n\r\nIn principle, I am also thinking of a zeppelin-api module, where there are only interfaces so that you cannot access the class directly in \"plugins\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1818462184/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1818474612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4692#issuecomment-1818474612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4692","id":1818474612,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5sY7h0","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-20T08:48:06Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T08:48:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"actually, I think `zeppelin-interpreter` should be kind of a lightweight API module, but I found packaging `zeppelin-interpreter-shaded` is extremely slow, and the shading process includes bunches of third-party jars, looks unreasonable ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1818474612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1818502773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4692#issuecomment-1818502773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4692","id":1818502773,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5sZCZ1","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-20T09:06:44Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T09:06:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"zeppelin-interpreter contains, among other things, the code to execute a Zeppelin interpreter remotely.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of Zeppelin is also included here.

Could you please check if it's ok or not?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elbakramer/zeppelin/actions/runs/7013954933\r\n\r\n![스크린샷 2023-12-07 오후 6 01 01](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/assets/12024377/862b1324-b370-4419-b51a-f608842650ac)\r\n\r\nWhat I've found about the hang is that, it seems like the `getBindedInterpreter()` method works like the get-or-create manner and it unintentionally creates a new interpreter instance upon `jobAbort()` if none exists. And that unexpected new interpreter makes all tests hang. My first guess about that method was like get-or-null manner but turned out to be wrong.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent that creation, I've added some checks before actually calling the method:\r\n\r\n- do nothing if the `Job` is aborted already\r\n- only call `getBindedInterpreter()` if\r\n  - the target for the abort is considered to exist already\r\n  - and current `this.interpreter` member is `null` (and should bind to the existing one in order to cancel that)\r\n\r\nI couldn't think of a direct way to check the existence of the interpreter instance. So it just indirectly checks whether if the job is currently running or not, assuming that there would be an interpreter instance if the job is in a running state.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1845005257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1845011925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4693#issuecomment-1845011925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4693","id":1845011925,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5t-KXV","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-07T09:42:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-07T09:42:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for checking and fixing it.
