For instance, I can do \r\n```http://localhost:15984/testdbblah?engine=blahgen```\r\nand that will work just fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/301992963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/301998674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/525#issuecomment-301998674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/525","id":301998674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTk5ODY3NA==","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T06:32:20Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T06:32:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 as well","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/301998674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/302040139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/496#issuecomment-302040139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/496","id":302040139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjA0MDEzOQ==","user":{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T09:41:55Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T09:41:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tonysun83 each storage engine should have a different file extension.

Adding URL strings to replication URLs seems like it'd not work so hot. Can you check what documents have been added? My guess is that the URL string is screwing things up and the replicator ends up posting random data that gets a UUID since the target database would interpret everything after the ? as a query parameter. Once its created any post would probably be interpreted as a request to create a new document. And that's not PSE specific. A similar test on not-PSE would be to try and specify a Q or N parameter in the target URL.

Thanks for the link. I'm not 100% certain what `State.line_length` is, but I'm assuming it's the character length of all of the functions and data combined.\r\n\r\nIf that's true, this heuristic seems like it would trigger on literally every output if you had enough views in the design doc. Please check my logic:\r\n\r\nGive a design doc 2k views, each with a reduce that is just `return values[0]`. Have all values just be `0`.\r\n\r\n`reduce_line == \"[\" + \"0,\" * 2047 + \"0]\"` which is 4097 characters long.\r\n\r\nIf all of the keys are unique, and we've got group=exact, then `input_length =  State.line_length - code_size` should be $HUGE - $HUGE leaving something about 4k in length as the input.\r\n\r\nSo `reduce_length` is 4097, and `input_length` is about the same, and it triggers every time.\r\n\r\nNow I realize this is a pathological setup (2k views, etc.) but I think that it points to a weakness in the approach. What if the heuristic were implemented this way (I've removed the error checking for brevity):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor(var i = 0; i < reduceFuns.length; i++) {\r\n    reductions[i] = reduceFuns[i](keys, values, rereduce);\r\n    reduction_len = JSON.stringify(reductions[i]).length\r\n    values_len = JSON.stringify(values).length\r\n    if(values.length > 3 && reduction_len > values_len / Math.sqrt(values.length)) {\r\n        // error out here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI realize the re approach wastes the output of the `JSON.stringify` calls, but A) I don't know if that's relevant to performance, and B) it could probably be fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/304426100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/304432993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/544#issuecomment-304432993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/544","id":304432993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDQzMjk5Mw==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-27T06:51:41Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T06:52:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That indeed will slow down view building for ddocs that have multiple views significantly, though I'd have to run numbers to prove it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that a) 99% of views with reduces use built-ins, and b) increasingly CouchDB users are encouraged to separate views into multiple ddocs anyway, and c) in the 3.x timeframe we're hoping to replace SpiderMoney with a newer JS engine, running directly inside Erlang so I'm not sure there's a lot of appetite to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nI'll leave the ticket open...just setting your expectations correctly that no one is going to burn a lot of cycles profiling this code just to generate a slightly improved error message here for <1% of our user base.\r\n\r\nTagging @nickva since he last touched this code, in case he wants to comment further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/304432993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/304453857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/544#issuecomment-304453857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/544","id":304453857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDQ1Mzg1Nw==","user":{"login":"elistevens","id":138016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens","html_url":"https://github.com/elistevens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elistevens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-27T14:08:40Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T14:08:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's a fair take on it.

I'll submit a separate PR that fixes this. Once that change was implemented, and I could set `max_objects` to `0`, I ran the test in a loop 500 times and got not a single failure.\r\n\r\nOur options are:\r\n1. Change the `ddoc_cache` flush on updating a ddoc to be synchronous, not asynchronous, at least in the pathological case of a single node server. However, I am betting some Cloudant stakeholders will not want this (/cc @davisp @rnewson @nickva)\r\n2. Improve our test harness to completely disable the `ddoc_cache` for this test, then use that option when running the test. This means augmenting `dev/run` and the JS harness so that we can specify `vm.args` files. Alternately, setup `ddoc_cache` with the appropriate `config:get` calls instead of using `application:get_env`.\r\n3. Discard the single test under review (`test/javascript/tests/show_documents.js` lines 280-296) To me this is sweeping the issue under the rug, though if we are permanently changing the semantics here, it is marginally acceptable.\r\n4. Drop ETag support for _shows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/305707270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
