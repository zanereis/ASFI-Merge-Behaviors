@mistercrunch while it's always good to have behaviours documented, in this case the timeout behaviour https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/docs/faq.rst#why-are-my-queries-timing-out , I would like to rephrase my concern via a couple of questions, hoping that this will clarify either the limitation that you addressed via the client-side timeout, either my goal in normalizing the behaviour across the board and not have a special client-side timeout.\r\n\r\n1. If I do not run superset behind a proxy, thus hypothetically no way to get a 504 response, but having data retrieval happening in more than 45 seconds, the client-side timeout will still kick in, not allowing the users to get queries that might have ended in 50 seconds, just 5 seconds after the timeout. Is this correct (=intended) behaviour?\r\n\r\n2. If I do run behind a proxy, which has a gateway timeout set to 10 seconds, the current behaviour is still to show 504 Gateway Time-out, instead of the \"warning message\". Is this correct (=intended) behaviour?\r\n\r\n3. Why is it that you cannot handle the 504 Gateway Time-out in a generic fashion, without having a client-side timeout?\r\n\r\n4. As it is now, the current behaviour introduced a warning message, which hides a perfectly fine HTTP error message (I believe other HTTP errors are still displayed), with a magic constant, that can only be configured by monkey-patching code.

From that perspective, the message itself is even more confusing and hedging with \"Perhaps\" doesn't help one bit. Just to be clear, that timeout will occur also if the backend already sent 200 OK, and partial headers/body but didn't yet signal the end of the HTTP message. Heck, it can even be that the browser pool of connections is filled and that the request doesn't even get sent from the queue - see definition of jquery.ajax' timeout.\r\n\r\nBut what is worse is that all of a sudden, superset instances become trapped by a magic 50s timeout. If indeed, @mistercrunch or someone else wanted/wants a client-side timeout instead of a world-wide known spinner that almost anyone knows it's either slow network or file too large or too much processing, then why not have it optional ? You show a friendly error message on all 504 errors, and optionally on a client-side timeout IFF the admin or maybe individual users in the future opt-in.\r\n\r\nFWIW 1.
