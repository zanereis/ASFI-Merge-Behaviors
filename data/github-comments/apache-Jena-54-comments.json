In the 5.1.0 logs, the error is on a read operation and the exception is happening after the query response has been sent so I don't think that 5.2.0 would be causing any visible dropped queries in the client. Is this the case?\r\n\r\nIn the log sample from 5.1.0, there isn't any overlapping operations, query or update. The log shows that all queries and updates execute in sequence with no overlaps of operations. The last update was 15 HTTP requests back.\r\n\r\nIs the client software making calls from just one client thread/process or from several?\r\nWhat library is the client software running to send SPARQL requests?\r\n\r\nAs updates are showing as happening, there isn't some old update starting before the log sample still hanging around.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think data has been dropped.\r\n\r\nIf that analysis is right, It is beginning to look like a thread-variable-consistency problem with the read-path. Jetty is probably using multiple threads causing true parallelism in the system, which is fine. In 5.2.0, the internal state is likely to be self-correcting, overwritten by a later read operation but that is speculation on my part.\r\n\r\nI may be able to reproduce something now. Caveat - if the above is the cause, it's all about exact timings and is going to be sensitive to the hardware and environment. \r\n\r\nIf you have cleaned up the config.ttl file, could you put the current one you are using on the issue so I have exactly the same as you?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2456565771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2459351092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2826#issuecomment-2459351092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2826","id":2459351092,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6Slrg0","user":{"login":"JervenBolleman","id":986133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjEzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/986133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman","html_url":"https://github.com/JervenBolleman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JervenBolleman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-06T10:36:21Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T10:36:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[ClinVarVariationRelease_00-latest_1.ttl.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17645683/ClinVarVariationRelease_00-latest_1.ttl.zip)\r\nA small example turtle file from the wild that has a \"\\r\" in a literal where it should not be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2459351092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2459867647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2821#issuecomment-2459867647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2821","id":2459867647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6Snpn_","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-06T14:14:27Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T14:14:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As a sidenote, neither QueryProcessor nor UpdateExec currently provide an `abort()` method, which might be a useful thing to add -

So I don't think this is a Jena6 matter and deleting and slimming down the code can happen as \"internal\" improvements.\r\n\r\nIt has been valuable to have all the details of datatypes implemented in an efficient manner. Jena forked off the Xerces codebase when it switched to using the JDK parser, or user choice of XML parser, and then Jena stopped shipping a Xerces jar and ICU4J (which is huge). `ext.xerces` is not connected to any XML processing including RDF/XML parsing. Presumably why `NamespaceContext` isn't used.\r\n\r\nThere is a use of `ext.xerces.impl.xpath.regex` in ARQ. It gives exact implementation of `REGEX` in SPARQL ([XPath/XQuery Functions and Operators regular expressions](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-3/#regex-syntax)).\r\nThe JDK regex subsystem is very close but not exact (there is a regex flag not provided) - JDK regex is used by default.\r\n\r\nI've opened the task #2833 to extract the regex engine for SPARQL/ARQ's use.\r\n\r\nThe only use in the datatypes area of `xpath.regex` I can find is in `XSSimpleTypeDecl` to support pattern facets. Such custom XSD datatypes are (probably!) not needed.

Is this the case?\r\n\r\nNo, I haven't observed any dropped queries.\r\nI was just curious about possible implications if this error were \"silently ignored\" now with the safeguard (https://github.com/apache/jena/commit/192f02e31f28b234e6944f323b697dce8f9cb929) introduced in 5.2.0.\r\nPerhaps the underlying problem (if there is one) is even completely solved in 5.2.0 and the safeguard isn't even being hit anymore, but I don't have a way of knowing that without some extra logging or breakpoint there.\r\nSo, just to be clear, in 5.2.0 it seems to work fine without error and, as far as I can tell from looking at it superficially, the data is also OK.\r\n\r\n> Is the client software making calls from just one client thread/process or from several?\r\n\r\nAll the calls/requests are done sequentially.\r\n\r\n> What library is the client software running to send SPARQL requests?\r\n\r\nWe're using our own tooling for this (https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-api, https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-tools). The SPARQL requests are done as HTTP GET/POST requests (e.g. https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-api/blob/main/webapi/src/main/scala/org/knora/webapi/store/triplestore/impl/TriplestoreServiceLive.scala#L147-L154).\r\n\r\n> If you have cleaned up the config.ttl file, could you put the current one you are using on the issue so I have exactly the same as you?\r\n\r\nI have not yet changed it, so it's still the same as the one I posted initially.\r\n\r\n> I haven't been able to recreate this with current Jena. PR https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2829 tidies up an inconsistent code pattern in jena-text but even manually single-stepping multiple threads through the execution didn't show the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks! I'll give it a try and set a breakpoint or add some logging to check whether the safeguard is still being hit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I won't be able to do any further tests though until probably the beginning of next week.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2467438273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/2467510481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2836#issuecomment-2467510481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2836","id":2467510481,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec6TEzjR","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T08:21:41Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T08:21:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dependabot
