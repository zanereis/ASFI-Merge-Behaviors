is a super valuable PR, just wanted to bring it up again and also give some feedback on it:\r\n\r\nI rebased this locally off of main today and built it, it works except in certain odd circumstances.\r\nFor instance, here's the following query being run:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString query = \"SELECT dname, MULTISET(\" +\r\n               \"  SELECT ename, MULTISET(\" +\r\n               \"    SELECT 1 FROM (VALUES (10), (20), (30), (40)) AS T(d_no) WHERE t.d_no IN (10, 20)\" +\r\n               \"  ) FROM emp AS e WHERE deptno = dept.deptno\" +\r\n               \") FROM dept\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26604994/181857856-96024c0d-5cd1-404a-8e52-ff3a7afab8fe.png)\r\n\r\nIt also worked with:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nString query2 = \"select\\n\" +\r\n                \"    \\\"first_name\\\",\\n\" +\r\n                \"    multiset(\\n\" +\r\n                \"        select \\\"store_name\\\", multiset(\\n\" +\r\n                \"            select \\\"fname\\\"\\n\" +\r\n                \"            from \\\"customer\\\"\\n\" +\r\n                \"            where \\\"customer\\\".\\\"customer_region_id\\\" <> 0 \\n\" +\r\n                \"        ) \\n\" +\r\n                \"        from \\\"store\\\"\\n\" +\r\n                \"        where \\\"store_id\\\" = \\\"employee\\\".\\\"store_id\\\"\\n\" +\r\n                \"    )\\n\" +\r\n                \"from \\\"employee\\\"\\n\" +\r\n                \"limit 2\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed though is that if the multiset returns an empty relation in a correlated subquery, you get an error about `$cor0` variable being null.\r\n\r\nTo trigger this, you can change the `where customer.customer_region_id` clause to be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nwhere \"customer\".\"customer_region_id\" = \"store\".\"region_id\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning that will give you:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCorrelation variable $cor0 should be defined\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Correlation variable $cor0 should be defined\r\n\tat org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.EnumerableRelImplementor.getCorrelVariableGetter(EnumerableRelImplementor.java:472)\r\n\tat

there is one more error which is less understandable to me, you can produce this one by modifying the `emps deps` query to:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString query = \"SELECT dname, MULTISET(\" +\r\n               \"  SELECT ename, MULTISET(\" +\r\n               \"    SELECT * FROM dept AS d WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno\" +\r\n               \"  ) FROM emp AS e WHERE deptno = dept.deptno\" +\r\n               \") FROM dept\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Error while executing SQL: Index 7 out of bounds for length 3\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 7 out

org.apache.calcite.sql2rel.RelFieldTrimmer.trimFields(RelFieldTrimmer.java:1282)\r\n\t... 66 more\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would offer to fix these and push this PR through to finished, but I still don't really have a clue about how Calcite works under the hood and that fancy relational algebra stuff =/\r\n\r\nHope this info is useful at least!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1200013442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1200439061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2606#issuecomment-1200439061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2606","id":1200439061,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5HjT8V","user":{"login":"beyond1920","id":1525333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920","html_url":"https://github.com/beyond1920","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-31T14:44:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T14:44:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
