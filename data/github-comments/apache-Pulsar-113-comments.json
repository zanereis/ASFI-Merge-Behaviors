PR is fine but I have a larger concern about how we a treating SchemaInfo.data.  In the API/SPI its a byte[] but in other places like GetSchemaResponse, we are converting it to a String.  This seems inappropriate and can cause confusion and bugs.  Currently, I think all SchemaInfo.data for schemas that use this is actually a String stored as bytes which shouldn't break things but I still think its bad practice assume the byte[] is convertible to a String.  Either we change the SchemaInfo.data to a String or we stop making assumptions in other places that we can converted to a String. Perhaps @sijie  @codelipenghui can also comment on this","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/494205666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/494213891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4318#issuecomment-494213891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4318","id":494213891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDIxMzg5MQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T02:18:06Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T02:19:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am not in favor of using `String` for storing schema data. because String requires correct charsets to encode and decode. So I would suggest keeping `byte[]` for storing schema data.\r\n\r\nGetSchemaResponse made a bad assumption on converting `byte[]` to `string`. Ideally it should be encoded using base64 because json doesn't support `byte[]` well. It is a legacy BC issue that we have to face. \r\n\r\nthat said, I don't think it is a good idea to use `GetSchemaResponse` directly. We should still convert the `GetSchemaResponse` to SchemaInfo. We should also consider fixing`GetSchemaResponse` to carry `byte[]` in base64 encoded format.\r\n\r\nWe can have a util class on displaying `SchemaInfo` in a correct format.\r\n\r\n- For struct schema (avro, json, protobuf), we are using avro schema definition on defining the schema structure. So we can convert the `byte[]` back to the json string and display the json string in a pretty format.\r\n\r\n- For non-struct schema, we should just use base64 for displaying schema data. \r\n\r\nIn summary, my opinion is:\r\n\r\n- it is a display issue. We should just fix the display issue rather than changing the return result.\r\n- GetSchemaResponse is buggy. We should consider improving or fixing it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/494213891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/494216925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4315#issuecomment-494216925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4315","id":494216925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDIxNjkyNQ==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T02:34:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T02:34:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jennifer88huang I copied the document to google doc, and updated according to your suggestion.

If we look at the user's entire system, pulsar is the important part, serving real-time streaming data. If it becomes unwritable, this is also data loss for the user.\r\n\r\nThe core of the problem is how the user should handle when the backlog has exceeded the threshold, delete old data or reject new data. For streaming data platforms, i think rejecting new data is basically unacceptable. Users can use the retention mechanism to confirm how long they retain data. \r\n\r\nFor the backlog, this is for a subscriber. There will be one subscriber's backlog cause all new data to be rejected. \r\n\r\nIf the default configuration is inclined to not lost data. reject new data should also be considered.\r\n\r\nIf do not consider resource limitations, not limit the backlog by default can match both two .
