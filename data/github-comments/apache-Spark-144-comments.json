but once that is available, spinning until some minimum threshold of executors is available should be done in user code and then start computations.\n\nOfcourse, if there is interest, this could be abstracted out for common use in contrib.\n\nCurrently, for our jobs, we have an arbitrary sleep introduced which is based on expectation of cluster load.\n\nOne unstated impact of this, which is not mentioned in the PR description, is that default parallelism is determined (in yarn mode atleast) by the number of available executors.\nSo the number of reducers used can be very low resulting for the first (few) jobs -

I understand, the application cannot control how many executors to launch (at least with the standalone mode). So I suppose it's difficult for the user to determine when he/she gets \"enough\" executors.\n\nAnother possible way to solve this issue is that when the TaskScheduler finds new executors/hosts in the resource offer, it can inform the TaskSetManager to re-compute the pending lists. TaskSetManager currently handles event like \"executor lost\", maybe it should also handle \"executor added\"?\n\nI have another concern about pendingTasksWithNoPrefs in TaskSetManager. This list now contains two kinds of tasks: tasks that truly have no preferred locations, and tasks whose preferred locations are not available. Tasks in this list are considered as PROCESS_LOCAL, which means they take precedence over tasks in NODE_LOCAL and RACK_LOCAL lists. Therefore in some scenario (the allowed locality is PROCESS_LOCAL), TaskSetManager may prefer tasks whose desired location is unavailable, to tasks that can run with some locality. Not sure if this behavior is intended?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44356508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44359841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/886#issuecomment-44359841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/886","id":44359841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzU5ODQx","user":{"login":"manishamde","id":1067223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjcyMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1067223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde","html_url":"https://github.com/manishamde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T02:41:17Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T02:41:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srowen It's good to know about the use-case for cardinality in the order of tens.\n\nThe categorical feature ordering using the average value of the target variable works well for both binary classification and regression (section 9.2.4 of Elements of Statistical Learning) and it's already implemented in MLlib decision tree. \n\nThis PR handles the scenario where the 'ordering' assumption does not hold true for the multiclass classification.

Also, the number of splits in the 'check for all' strategy will always be lower than the bin size.\n\nWe will have to use a heuristic if we support more than 10 categorical values. I am fine with using entropy (as @srowen suggested) -- a reference will be great if we can find one. \n\nIt's always difficult to find a reference for practical issues since they are harder to publish.

PySpark could add a fixed amount, and users might want to add more if they're allocating direct byte buffers.  Some compression codecs allocate direct byte buffers, so if we want to get fancy, we could take that in to account.\n\nI'm opposed to removing the 384 altogether.  Having had to explain 2 bajillion times that two MR configs need to be updated every time one wants to increase task memory, I've really appreciated that Spark handles this automatically.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44366899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44367561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/893#issuecomment-44367561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/893","id":44367561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzY3NTYx","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T05:37:44Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T05:37:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rxin Thanks!\nBut notice that current `CountDistinctFunction` uses `HashSet` to count and its `size` is limited in `Int` range, so the problem @ash211 said still exists in `CountDistinct`.\nIt might be another issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44367561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/44367661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/826#issuecomment-44367661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/826","id":44367661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzY3NjYx","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-28T05:39:48Z","updated_at":"2014-05-28T05:39:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey - thanks for this fix.
