Previous serialization of the request/response objects depended on serializing the struct representation directly into a `ByteBuffer`. Because `FetchResponse` needs to write to the channel directly (to support \"zero copy\"), I modified these objects to instead provide their own `Send` objects, which allowed me to override the default send behavior. I also implemented a custom `Records` schema type to make the usage a little nicer.\n\nTo interoperate with the server-side `MessageSet` objects, I added a method to convert to the `Records` representation. Internally, the server still uses `MessageSet`, but it converts to `Records` prior to serialization, which allowed me to get rid of `MessageSet.writeTo`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/256471153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/256489531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2066#issuecomment-256489531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2066","id":256489531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjQ4OTUzMQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T21:58:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T21:58:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

I am thinking if we should have a better configuration compatibility check in the configurations. Currently we have a `Recommender` in the ConfigDef, but that seems not sufficient because it only gives a set of valid values of a configuration based on the value of some other configuration. In many cases we only want to verify wether the values user provided for different configurations make sense or not. So we just need something like a compatibility validator. We can probably do that in another patch.

`foreach`, and then later in my topology when I wanted to call any other functions that are not `xxValues` I need to call `entries` to get the KStream again, this syntax is a bit different from Java syntax where if you call `values` you are effectively \"projecting\" only the values in the future operations, and cannot go back; even if I am OK with that, I still need to be careful about operators that is not a one-to-one mapping (e.g. `flatMap`) where in this case the before-projectiong `KStream` is actually inheriting the same key for each of the output when you transform back via `entries`.\n\nSo personally I'd prefer to keep the programming model enforcing users to think about these corner issues themselves, i.e. to make the API simple-to-reason though maybe less
