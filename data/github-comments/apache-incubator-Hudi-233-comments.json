hi @gnailJC Thanks for the question, now `timestamp as of` only supports `table` operations, not `view` related operations yet. If there is a business scenario requirement, we can implement it, and mention a jira.\r\n\r\nthanks for your reply! @XuQianJin-Stars I need to create a view based on hudi table data on a special old instant to query the old data.\r\nso I try two way to get it.\r\n1. use `create view xx select * from hudi_tbl timestamp as of xxxx`, and it's not support yet we know.\r\n2. so i try the second way, like \r\n`CREATE external TABLE tbl_snapshot_v20220512164415876\r\nusing hudi\r\noptions (\r\n    as.of.instant=20220513103255808\r\n) LOCATION 'xxxx;`\r\ncreate a table first, and create a view based on this table.\r\nbut the `as.of.instant` is not work, it always query the latest snapshot, why?\r\n\r\nand now I try use inc query:\r\n`\r\nCREATE external TABLE  tbl_inc_v20220512170625756\r\nusing hudi\r\noptions (\r\n    hoodie.datasource.query.type='incremental',\r\n    hoodie.datasource.read.begin.instanttime=0,\r\n    hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime=20220512170625756\r\n) LOCATION 'xxx';\r\n`\r\nand the `hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime` is work! so why the `as.of.instant` can't  but the ` hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime` can work?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1127387241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1127421030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5588#issuecomment-1127421030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5588","id":1127421030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5DMxRm","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-16T09:09:38Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T09:09:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tests
