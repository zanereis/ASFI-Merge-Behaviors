I thought about this before, but the implications from removing the partition assignment check were not very clear to me. I think there are basically three cases to consider:\n1. The current generation is still active.\n2. There is a rebalance in progress.\n3. A rebalance was previously completed (and the member was kicked out).\n\nFor (1) and (2), this change appears to work fine. The coordinator should accept the commits and we will have a chance to rebalance the next time poll() is invoked. However, for (3), I'm not sure we'll recover correctly since the commits will always return either UNKNOWN_CONSUMER or ILLEGAL_GENERATION, which are both designated retriable. The loop will spin forever since it no longer has a way to refresh the generation. \n\nOne of the problems is that the current \"retriable\" notion is pretty limited. In fact, those errors are only retriable in the context of a JoinGroup. For everything else, they are not retriable. My suggestion would probably be to make them non-retriable, and then to add special checks in the join group loop to check for them. This would mean that the illegal generation errors in commitSync would get propagated to the user, which is probably a lot better than trying to force through the old commit on a new generation. What do you think?\n\nAlso, I agree that use of illegal generation is a little confusing. I would rather reserve that error for when the generation is officially superseded. Instead of using illegal generation in the heartbeat response to indicate a need to rebalance, maybe we can have a REJOIN_NEEDED error or something like that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142078573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142079107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/220#issuecomment-142079107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/220","id":142079107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjA3OTEwNw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T19:04:48Z","updated_at":"2015-09-21T19:04:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142079107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142079878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/195#issuecomment-142079878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/195","id":142079878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjA3OTg3OA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T19:06:50Z","updated_at":"2015-09-21T19:06:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr

Thanks for the explanation. Case (3) is actually a failure case, the consumer has already been kicked out of the group. Letting a commit offset trigger a rebalance and proceed might cause some issue. For example:\n1. Consumer 1 is consuming from 100 from partition 1. Consumer 2 is consuming from 100 from partition 2.\n2. Consumer 2 somehow was kicked out of the group\n3. Consumer 1 now consumes from offset 200 from partion1 and 200 from partion2.\n4. Consumer 2 commits offset 100.\n5. In this case if we let consumer 2 proceed the offset of partition 2 will rewind.\n\nPersonally I prefer to have the rebalance triggered by IllegalGenerationID only happen in heartbeat. In other cases, that is actually an error user needs to be aware of, perhaps throwing an exception is better than swallowing the error.\n\nCompletely agree with the ambiguity of IllegalGenerationIdException.

This shouldn't be done now because, firstly, we don't have AdminClient, secondly, if something is wrong with this patch we will leave people no way to create/alter/delete topics - the old tool will be

Funny, I was also wondering earlier today if the generation was still needed. To actually get that error instead of UNKNOWN_CONSUMER, the client implementation would have to successfully join the group, but fail to update its own generation. Perhaps that might be possible if the implementation timed out the JoinGroup request before receiving the response and then continued consuming anyway? Seems like a rather far-fetched case to dedicate a whole concept to. The generation might be more useful if clients provided their own consumerId, but we just use uuids, so the chance of collision is basically zero.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142442435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/142451352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/222#issuecomment-142451352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/222","id":142451352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjQ1MTM1Mg==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-22T23:24:32Z","updated_at":"2015-09-22T23:24:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After thinking a little more, the generation seems more useful when group state is persisted in zookeeper. I think it tries to handle an edge case where the coordinator fails immediately after writing the group state. When the new coordinator takes over, it initially has no idea whether all members in the last group actually received the assignment or not. After it receives the heartbeats from the consumers, however, it can can tell by comparing the generation with the one stored in zookeeper.
