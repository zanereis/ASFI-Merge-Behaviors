in our thrift we tried to suggest that endpoint is used for querying along with service name https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/thrift/zipkinCore.thrift#L297\n\nWhile Annotation.host and BinaryAnnotation.host fields are marked \"optional\", that's only a side effect of the original thrift. The description states that they are used both for query and also dependency links.\n\nMy guess is \"host\" (aka endpoint) was originally marked optional as it was lazy applied right before reporting the span out of process.\nhttps://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/develop/finagle-zipkin-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/zipkin/core/Span.scala#L61\n\nIn practice, it is sent with all instrumentation I've seen except Jaeger (which is either an oversight or an intentional incompatibility). That's because there can be multiple hosts in the same span. How do you know which was responsible for that annotation?\n\nSo, if you are querying by serviceName, you'll need to report spans with endpoint set. If this is about query by annotation when serviceName a query parameter, I know that isn't fully supported. We'd want a separate issue for that.\n\nThis issue seems to show api queries with serviceName present, so the action to take is to fix the incompatibility in jaeger. If the incompatibility is intentional, you could get out by adjusting the ZipkinSender to backfill missing endpoint.host prior to encoding. That way, folks using Zipkin can work regardless of the policy in jaeger's core code.\n\nhttps://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-java/blob/master/jaeger-zipkin/src/main/java/com/uber/jaeger/senders/zipkin/ZipkinSender.java#L97\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/253380590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/253381340","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1339#issuecomment-253381340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1339","id":253381340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzM4MTM0MA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T00:56:03Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T00:56:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@yurishkuro @vprithvi fyi\n\nthe adjustment to jaeger would be similar to finagle.. backfill missing endpoints prior to send.

for raising this. It would be interesting to understand if such a thing would be possible to do.\n\nLet's keep in mind that assuming that whitespace is network delay can be problematic. I made some comments on your issue about improving how the UI renders spans such that network timing can be more obvious https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-ui/issues/16\n\nAlso, analyzing the quality of traces isn't the job of the UI code. Ex, we don't buy a new TV because the news reports have bad signal.. maybe we just change the channel :)\n\nI'd suggest that analysis (and correction) should be an offline or stream processing job, similar to how it was at Twitter back when hadoop jobs were used for quality concern. Such a thing would be awesome, no doubt, but better fodder for a separate repo, as the concern is vast and primarily focuses on instrumentation.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is open about their pipeline or analysis code, so I don't have a lot of examples of similar things.

Let's say the entire trace took 10ms and span1 took 1ms, span2 took 2ms and span3 took 3ms. In the trace view, it would be nice to show an additional line of text like: \"Total span duration is 60%(6ms) of trace duration (10ms)\"  to summarize the data better.\n\nThis kind of message is useful because the rest 40% is either a missing span or overhead not captured by the network requests and needs further investigation. We typically have ~120 spans in a request and we assume that 75% of the time is spent on the network and the rest is processing overhead. Currently, our users manually calculate these latency numbers every time. \n\nIf the community feels that this is a valuable feature for everyone, I will add it to the

This will create 2 tokens for trace ids who are 128-bit and one if 64-bit. This allows existing tools which only support 64-bit ids (like SpanStore) to work, without limiting future tools from doing exact match on 128-bit. The cost is 2x the trace id tokens in sites who are 100% 128-bit.

work:\n\nzipkin-reporter has a micro(ish)benchmark which tests the throughput of senders like Kafka (not directly to a zipkin server, but could be rejigged to) \n\nEx. https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/zipkin/reporter/HttpSenderBenchmarks.java\n\nThe sender itself is used by many instrumentation projects (like brave, spring etc), but it was also made to facilitate benchmarking a real setup. The idea was to use something like [jbender](https://github.com/pinterest/jbender) and hook it up to a reporter and a generator. It would need a plugin to monitor backup etc.\n\nThere was also an idea to use [spigo](https://github.com/adrianco/spigo) to simulate loads. This stopped working at some point and also needs help to route through our [go library as opposed to creating dump files](https://github.com/adrianco/spigo/issues/67).\n\nAnother idea was to use storage-specific benchmarks, such as Rally for elasticsearch #1354 or stress tool for cassandra. While not flow tests, these could help isolate storage performance concerns (like indexing)\n\nWe've also had a number of ad-hoc tests where people make python scripts to test kafka.

The manual denormalisation of the span name list to a separate table no longer exists, instead it is implicitly denormalised via a materialized view to the `trace_by_service` table.\n\nThe UI calls `store.getSpanNames(serviceName)` for a given serviceName and this does the cql query: `SELECT span_name FROM trace_by_service where service_name = '<service_name>' LIMIT 100;`\n\nThe materialized view doesn't actually need to store blank span_names (the origin table trace_by_service_span does though).

For example, instead of literally sending `2016-01-01, 2016-01-02 ..  2016-04-01, 2016-04-02`, we could send  `2016-01-*, 2016-01-*, 2016-03-*, 2016-04-01, 2016-04-02`. In the example given, of spans this year up to april 2nd, it would reduce the date expressions sent from over a hundred to 5. I'll open an issue for this\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/257224528/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/257239315","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1330#issuecomment-257239315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1330","id":257239315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzIzOTMxNQ==","user":{"login":"sroze","id":804625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDYyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/804625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze","html_url":"https://github.com/sroze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sroze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T08:37:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T08:37:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I used to advocate the many-repository architecture but I'm not anymore, as the dependencies are mostly dev dependencies and the users can pick what they want without installing 10 different packages.
