Initially, I am imagining that this won't support any kind of grouping; rather, we could initially support authenticating **individual users** against known oauth identity providers, such as github and google.\r\n\r\nOne of the tricky points here, especially viz. an open source project such as OpenWhisk, would be in supporting the secrets:\r\n\r\n1. For each identity provider, the maintainer of a production OpenWhisk installation would need to allocate a (id,secret) pair. This we can address via documentation. In an ideal world, we could offer scripting support for this, but perhaps we can start with documentation.\r\n\r\n2. The more complex issue is the **support for continuous integration**.  In particular, how can we support Travis tests against PRs? Do we allocate a set of test **(id,secret)** pairs, and store them in the Travis key store? Does this violate the open source nature of OpenWhisk, to have secrets such as this? And what about localhost testing?\r\n\r\nOr, do we make a set of (id,secret) pairs public, stating forcefully that one must not depend on these for production installations?\r\n\r\nFinally, to test the full login path, from wsk client through the server-side backend (and back), we would *also* need to have a set of user login credentials, so that the test client can log on to the identity providers. This raises mostly the same issues as with the (id,secret) pair, perhaps with some additional concerns; e.g. fine, we can make an (id,secret) pair public, for testing purposes, but surely we can't make a github or google login credential public...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268116154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268138088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1666#issuecomment-268138088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1666","id":268138088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODEzODA4OA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T02:34:10Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T02:34:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cherry

Additionally, there is the configuration nightmare of refreshing an access token, where the action also needs the introspection/refresh endpoint for the OP. That seems an area where the solution needs to reside outside the action code.\r\n\r\nFor #B, conceptually that is just an addition to the existing \"Authorization\" header in the invocation of the action via endpoints, though it does entail costly provisions at the OpenWhisk installation level (manage client id/secrets) . \r\n\r\nI am not immediately interested in #B, though I can see how people thinking of monetizing the access to their actions have a legitimate need for separate sets of credentials per customer. They definitely would not want to pay for CPU time in building the authorization layer inside their action code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268384596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268388728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1640#issuecomment-268388728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1640","id":268388728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODM4ODcyOA==","user":{"login":"psuter","id":245547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter","html_url":"https://github.com/psuter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T23:24:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T23:24:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged as 43a8d2f904b02249f86cb79b77be490e2e1cea30","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268388728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268388799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1641#issuecomment-268388799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1641","id":268388799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODM4ODc5OQ==","user":{"login":"psuter","id":245547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter","html_url":"https://github.com/psuter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T23:24:33Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T23:24:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged as 424fc75387763a4c5831e9764027fc2d172551ff","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268388799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/268503195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1672#issuecomment-268503195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1672","id":268503195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODUwMzE5NQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T11:44:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T11:44:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agree - this is a duplicate of https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/issues/373.

from another issue opened by me:\r\n\r\n## Problem statement\r\n\r\nCurrently we support a fixed number of runtimes in OpenWhisk \"natively\". That means a user can upload an artifact specific to the language (i.e. a code snipped) and we will treat it as needed by that language (compile it, run it).\r\n\r\nWhile this is all good, the approach doesn't scale from a CI/CD point of view. We're currently hitting the 50 minute mark in Travis repeatedly and even with that off the table, our build times will just increase over time as we add new runtimes. Building the different runtimes, especially Swift currently, has a big impact on our overall build time. It also impacts first-time contributors as the time to \"just deploy the system locally\" increases.\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe could add a plugin system for runtimes and only ship OpenWhisk with a default runtime (Node.js for example). We benefit from this in multiple ways:\r\n1. Build and testtime for just the _core_ system decreases. As we only test what's common for every language. I think it makes sense to define at least one language as being the default though, to facilitate end-to-end testing and have a better test-coverage for that core system.\r\n2. It's easier for contributors to add new runtimes, as they likely don't have to touch the core components.\r\n## Thoughts on design\r\n\r\nTo implement this we could make runtimes part of the configuration.
