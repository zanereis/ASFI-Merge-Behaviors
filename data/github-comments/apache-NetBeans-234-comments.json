The `antlr4` [lexer] grammar works correctly for correct files, but can't handle a file with a missing `}`, for example. For `antlr4` grammars to work correctly with the antlr editor bridge, the grammars must contemplate an \"error\" token and not just return `null` on incorrect files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2609520775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2609638233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8142#issuecomment-2609638233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8142","id":2609638233,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6bi-tZ","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-23T12:04:18Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T12:04:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW,

Changes:\r\n1) Split the PR into two commits, one for the most trivial changes, and one\r\n   for the slightly more complex changes that had some review comments. \r\n2) Change `loadImageIcon(path, false)` to `ImageUtilities.loadIcon(path)` where possible\r\n   (the latter utility method was added in https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8114 ). (In both commits.)\r\n3) Simplify the mergeImages cases by using the new ImageUtilities.mergeIcons method\r\n   (also from https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8114). (Second commit only.)\r\n4) Some other revisions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nFor those who reviewed a previous version of this PR, the changes that might need another look are in the second commit. The first commit was just edited mechanically from the patch file itself, to switch loadImageIcon to loadIcon and remove the \", false\" second argument which is the default for loadIcon anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2613272856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
