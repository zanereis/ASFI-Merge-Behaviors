State support in core storm<br/>\n    +Storm core has abstractions for bolts to save and retrieve the state of its operations. There is a default in-memory<br/>\n    +based state implementation and also a Redis backed implementation that provides state persistence.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## State management<br/>\n    +Bolts that requires its state to be managed and persisted by the framework should implement the `IStatefulBolt` interface or<br/>\n    +extend the `BaseStatefulBolt` and implement `void initState(T state)` method. The `initState` method is invoked by the framework<br/>\n    +during the bolt initialization with the previously saved state of the bolt. This is invoked after prepare but before the bolt starts<br/>\n    +processing any tuples.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Currently the only kind of `State` implementation that is supported is `KeyValueState` which provides key-value mapping.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +For example a word count bolt could use the key value state abstraction for the word counts as follows.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +1. Extend the BaseStatefulBolt and type parameterize it with KeyValueState which would store the mapping of word to count.<br/>\n    +2. The bolt gets initialized with its previously saved state in the init method. This will contain the word counts<br/>\n    +last committed by the framework during the previous run.<br/>\n    +3. In the execute method, update the word count.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    + ```java<br/>\n    + public class WordCountBolt extends BaseStatefulBolt<KeyValueState<String, Long>> {<br/>\n    + private KeyValueState<String, Long> wordCounts;<br/>\n    + ...<br/>\n    +     @Override<br/>\n    +     public void initState(KeyValueState<String, Long> state) </p>\n{\n    +       wordCounts = state;\n    +     }\n<p>    +     @Override<br/>\n    +     public void execute(Tuple tuple, BasicOutputCollector collector) </p>\n{\n    +       String word = tuple.getString(0);\n    +       Integer count = wordCounts.get(word, 0);\n    +       count++;\n    +       wordCounts.put(word, count);\n    +       collector.emit(new Values(word, count));\n    +     }\n<p>    + ...<br/>\n    + }<br/>\n    + ```<br/>\n    +4. The framework periodically checkpoints the state of the bolt (default every second). The frequency<br/>\n    +can be changed by setting the storm config `topology.state.checkpoint.interval.ms`<br/>\n    +5. For state persistence, use a state provider that supports persistence by setting the `topology.state.provider` in the<br/>\n    +storm config. E.g. for using Redis based key-value state implementation set `topology.state.provider: org.apache.storm.redis.state.RedisKeyValueStateProvider`<br/>\n    +in storm.yaml. The provider implementation jar should be in the class path, which in this case means putting the `storm-redis-*.jar`<br/>\n    +in the extlib directory.<br/>\n    +6. The state provider properties can be overridden by setting `topology.state.provider.config`. For Redis state this is a<br/>\n    +json config with the following properties.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    + ```<br/>\n    + {<br/>\n    +   \"keyClass\": \"Optional fully qualified class name of the Key type.\",<br/>\n    +   \"valueClass\": \"Optional fully qualified class name of the Value type.\",<br/>\n    +   \"keySerializerClass\": \"Optional Key serializer implementation class.\",<br/>\n    +   \"valueSerializerClass\": \"Optional Value Serializer implementation class.\",<br/>\n    +   \"jedisPoolConfig\": </p>\n{\n    +     \"host\": \"localhost\",\n    +     \"port\": 6379,\n    +     \"timeout\": 2000,\n    +     \"database\": 0,\n    +     \"password\": \"xyz\"\n    +     }\n<p>    + }<br/>\n    + ```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Checkpoint mechanism<br/>\n    +Checkpoint is triggered by an internal checkpoint spout at the specified `topology.state.checkpoint.interval.ms`. If there is<br/>\n    +at-least one `IStatefulBolt` in the topology, the checkpoint spout is automatically added by the topology builder . For stateful topologies,<br/>\n    +the topology builder wraps the `IStatefulBolt` in a `StatefulBoltExecutor` which handles the state commits on receiving the checkpoint tuples.<br/>\n    +The non stateful bolts are wrapped in a `CheckpointTupleForwarder` which just forwards the checkpoint tuples so that the checkpoint tuples<br/>\n    +can flow through the topology DAG. The checkpoint tuples flow through a separate internal stream namely `$checkpoint`. The topology builder<br/>\n    +wires the checkpoint stream across the whole topology with the checkpoint spout at the root.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +      default default       default<br/>\n    +<span class=\"error\">&#91;spout1&#93;</span>   ---------------> <span class=\"error\">&#91;statefulbolt1&#93;</span> ----------> <span class=\"error\">&#91;bolt1&#93;</span> --------------> <span class=\"error\">&#91;statefulbolt2&#93;</span><br/>\n    +  | ----------> --------------><br/>\n    +  |   ($chpt)       ($chpt)<br/>\n    +  |<br/>\n    +<span class=\"error\">&#91;$checkpointspout&#93;</span> _______| ($chpt)<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +At checkpoint intervals the checkpoint tuples are emitted by the checkpoint spout. On receiving a checkpoint tuple, the state of the bolt<br/>\n    +is saved and then the checkpoint tuple is forwarded to the next component. Each bolt waits for the checkpoint to arrive on all its input<br/>\n    +streams before it saves its state so that the state represents a consistent state across the topology. Once the checkpoint spout receives<br/>\n    +ACK from all the bolts, the state commit is complete and the transaction is recorded as committed by the checkpoint spout.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The state commit works like a three phase commit protocol with a prepare and commit phase so that the state across the topology is saved<br/>\n    +in a consistent and atomic manner.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Recovery<br/>\n    +The recovery phase is triggered when the topology is started for the first time. If the previous transaction was not successfully<br/>\n    +prepared, a `rollback` message is sent across the topology so that if a bolt has some prepared transactions it can be discarded.<br/>\n    +If the previous transaction was prepared successfully but not committed, a `commit` message is sent across the topology so that<br/>\n    +the prepared transactions can be committed. After these steps are complete, the bolts are initialized with the state.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The recovery is also triggered if one of the bolts fails to acknowledge the checkpoint message or say a worker crashed in<br/>\n    +the middle. Thus when the worker is restarted by the supervisor, the checkpoint mechanism makes sure that the bolt gets<br/>\n    +initialized with its previous state and the checkpointing continues from the point where it left off.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Guarantee<br/>\n    +Storm relies on the acking mechanism to replay tuples in case of failures. It is possible that the state is committed<br/>\n    +but the worker crashes before acking the tuples. In this case the tuples are replayed causing duplicate state updates.<br/>\n    +Also currently the StatefulBoltExecutor continues to process the tuples from a stream after it has received a checkpoint<br/>\n    +tuple on one stream while waiting for checkpoint to arrive on other input streams for saving the state. This can also cause<br/>\n    +duplicate state updates during recovery.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The state abstraction does not eliminate duplicate evaluations and currently provides only at-least once guarantee.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### IStateful bolt hooks<br/>\n    +IStatefult bolt interface provides hook methods where in the stateful bolts could implement some custom actions.<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    IStatefult -> IStateful</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612692340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612692343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5251#issuecomment-2612692343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5251","id":2612692343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2OTIzNDM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-05T00:13:16Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:40:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/984#discussion_r48799430\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/984#discussion_r48799430</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: docs/documentation/State-checkpointing.md &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,147 @@<br/>\n    +# State support in core storm<br/>\n    +Storm core has abstractions for bolts to save and retrieve the state of its operations.

For Redis state this is a<br/>\n    +json config with the following properties.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    + ```<br/>\n    + {<br/>\n    +   \"keyClass\": \"Optional fully qualified class name of the Key type.\",<br/>\n    +   \"valueClass\": \"Optional fully qualified class name of the Value type.\",<br/>\n    +   \"keySerializerClass\": \"Optional Key serializer implementation class.\",<br/>\n    +   \"valueSerializerClass\": \"Optional Value Serializer implementation class.\",<br/>\n    +   \"jedisPoolConfig\": </p>\n{\n    +     \"host\": \"localhost\",\n    +     \"port\": 6379,\n    +     \"timeout\": 2000,\n    +     \"database\": 0,\n    +     \"password\": \"xyz\"\n    +     }\n<p>    + }<br/>\n    + ```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Checkpoint mechanism<br/>\n    +Checkpoint is triggered by an internal checkpoint spout at the specified `topology.state.checkpoint.interval.ms`. If there is<br/>\n    +at-least one `IStatefulBolt` in the topology, the checkpoint spout is automatically added by the topology builder . For stateful topologies,<br/>\n    +the topology builder wraps the `IStatefulBolt` in a `StatefulBoltExecutor` which handles the state commits on receiving the checkpoint tuples.<br/>\n    +The non stateful bolts are wrapped in a `CheckpointTupleForwarder` which just forwards the checkpoint tuples so that the checkpoint tuples<br/>\n    +can flow through the topology DAG. The checkpoint tuples flow through a separate internal stream namely `$checkpoint`. The topology builder<br/>\n    +wires the checkpoint stream across the whole topology with the checkpoint spout at the root.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +      default default       default<br/>\n    +<span class=\"error\">&#91;spout1&#93;</span>   ---------------> <span class=\"error\">&#91;statefulbolt1&#93;</span> ----------> <span class=\"error\">&#91;bolt1&#93;</span> --------------> <span class=\"error\">&#91;statefulbolt2&#93;</span><br/>\n    +  | ----------> --------------><br/>\n    +  |   ($chpt)       ($chpt)<br/>\n    +  |<br/>\n    +<span class=\"error\">&#91;$checkpointspout&#93;</span> _______| ($chpt)<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +At checkpoint intervals the checkpoint tuples are emitted by the checkpoint spout. On receiving a checkpoint tuple, the state of the bolt<br/>\n    +is saved and then the checkpoint tuple is forwarded to the next component. Each bolt waits for the checkpoint to arrive on all its input<br/>\n    +streams before it saves its state so that the state represents a consistent state across the topology. Once the checkpoint spout receives<br/>\n    +ACK from all the bolts, the state commit is complete and the transaction is recorded as committed by the checkpoint spout.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The state commit works like a three phase commit protocol with a prepare and commit phase so that the state across the topology is saved<br/>\n    +in a consistent and atomic manner.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Recovery<br/>\n    +The recovery phase is triggered when the topology is started for the first time. If the previous transaction was not successfully<br/>\n    +prepared, a `rollback` message is sent across the topology so that if a bolt has some prepared transactions it can be discarded.<br/>\n    +If the previous transaction was prepared successfully but not committed, a `commit` message is sent across the topology so that<br/>\n    +the prepared transactions can be committed. After these steps are complete, the bolts are initialized with the state.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The recovery is also triggered if one of the bolts fails to acknowledge the checkpoint message or say a worker crashed in<br/>\n    +the middle. Thus when the worker is restarted by the supervisor, the checkpoint mechanism makes sure that the bolt gets<br/>\n    +initialized with its previous state and the checkpointing continues from the point where it left off.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### Guarantee<br/>\n    +Storm relies on the acking mechanism to replay tuples in case of failures. It is possible that the state is committed<br/>\n    +but the worker crashes before acking the tuples. In this case the tuples are replayed causing duplicate state updates.<br/>\n    +Also currently the StatefulBoltExecutor continues to process the tuples from a stream after it has received a checkpoint<br/>\n    +tuple on one stream while waiting for checkpoint to arrive on other input streams for saving the state. This can also cause<br/>\n    +duplicate state updates during recovery.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The state abstraction does not eliminate duplicate evaluations and currently provides only at-least once guarantee.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### IStateful bolt hooks<br/>\n    +IStatefult bolt interface provides hook methods where in the stateful bolts could implement some custom actions.<br/>\n    +```java<br/>\n    +    /**<br/>\n    +     * This is a hook for the component to perform some actions just before the<br/>\n    +     * framework commits its state.<br/>\n    +     */<br/>\n    +    void preCommit(long txid);<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +    /**<br/>\n    +     * This is a hook for the component to perform some actions just before the<br/>\n    +     * framework prepares its state.<br/>\n    +     */<br/>\n    +    void prePrepare(long txid);<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +    /**<br/>\n    +     * This is a hook for the component to perform some actions just before the<br/>\n    +     * framework rolls back the prepared state.<br/>\n    +     */<br/>\n    +    void preRollback();<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +This is optional and stateful bolts are not expected to provide any implementation. This is provided so that other<br/>\n    +system level components can be built on top of the stateful abstractions where we might want to take some actions before the<br/>\n    +stateful bolt's state is prepared, committed or rolled back.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Providing custom state implementations<br/>\n    +Currently the only kind of `State` implementation supported is `KeyValueState` which provides key-value mapping.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Custom state implementations should provide implementations for the methods defined in the `backtype.storm.State` interface.<br/>\n    +These are the `void prepareCommit(long txid)`, `void commit(long txid)`, `rollback()` methods. `commit()` method is optional<br/>\n    +and is useful if the bolt manages the state on its own. This is currently used only by the internal system bolts,<br/>\n    +for e.g. the CheckpointSpout to save its state.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +`KeyValueState` implementation should also implement the methods defined in the `backtype.storm.state.KeyValueState` interface.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +### State provider<br/>\n    +The framework instantiates the state via the corresponding `StateProvider` implementation. A custom state should also provide<br/>\n    +a `StateProvider` implementation which can load and return the state based on the namespace. Each state belongs to a unique namespace.<br/>\n    +The namespace is typically unique per task so that each task can have its own state. The StateProvider and the corresponding<br/>\n    +State implementation should be available in the class path of the storm (by placing them in the extlib directory).<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff
