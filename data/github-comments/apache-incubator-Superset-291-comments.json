get_example_database()\r\n>>> sqla_table = example_db.get_table(\"energy_usage\")\r\n>>> col = next(iter(sqla_table.columns))\r\n>>> col\r\nColumn('source', VARCHAR(collation='utf8_unicode_ci', length=255), table=<energy_usage>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand thus I'm a little perplexed as to why we need `column_datatype_to_string` as surely this collation and character encoding code could (and possibly should) be removed at the column level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/599817900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/599874425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8302#issuecomment-599874425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8302","id":599874425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTg3NDQyNQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T04:42:50Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T04:42:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

Pandas is doing some funky things here in `pivot_table`. While clearly `np.isnan(np.sum(np.nan)) == True` `df.pivot_table({...}, aggfunc=np.sum)` of a column that has only `None` returns 0.\r\n\r\nAnyhow. This here works, I picked `np.min` as no aggregates apply (already at the right grain) and with `np.min` a `None` leads to `nan`, which works well in the end (same as before the original PR). I tested this same unit test on before this PR and it fails (as expected, with the `0` value in place of the `None/nan/NULL`), and tested on before the a commit prior to the PR that created the problem  `753aeb482991f0dd3f36373f6d248ce277c67949` and this unit test passes. This gives pretty high confidence that `None` / `NULL` will be treated the same as before.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/599885216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/599887303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9314#issuecomment-599887303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9314","id":599887303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTg4NzMwMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T05:38:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T05:38:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9314?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#9314](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9314?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/f1370c5e324d7817b0fda92079178440c0832081&el=desc) will **not change** coverage by `%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9314/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=KsB0fHcx6l)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9314?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #9314   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   59.08%   59.08%           \n=======================================\n  Files         374      374           \n  Lines       12205    12205           \n  Branches     2989     2989           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7211     7211           \n  Misses       4815     4815           \n  Partials      179      179           \n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9314?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9314?src=pr&el=footer).

So I guess it comes down to removing the additional info to avoid having to make a metadata migration and keeping the type column slightly lighter in the table editor, or just making it wider and providing the users more context of the column types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/600216451/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/600225813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9318#issuecomment-600225813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9318","id":600225813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDIyNTgxMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-17T18:21:53Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T18:21:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9318?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#9318](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9318?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/f1370c5e324d7817b0fda92079178440c0832081?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9318/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9318?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #9318   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   59.08%   59.08%           \n=======================================\n  Files         374      374           \n  Lines       12205    12205           \n  Branches     2989     2989           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7211     7211           \n  Misses       4815     4815           \n  Partials      179      179\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9318?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9318?src=pr&el=footer).

Adding dynamic import on the entire plugin level may not save much bundle size.\r\n\r\nEach `ChartPlugin` has 5 parts \r\n* `metadata` - very small js object\r\n* `buildQuery` - could be big or small, **support dynamic import**\r\n* `Chart` - could be big or small, **support dynamic import**\r\n* `transformProps` - could be big or small, **support dynamic import**\r\n* `controlPanel` - small js object.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default class LineChartPlugin extends ChartPlugin {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super({\r\n      // metadata does not use dynamic import since it is so small.\r\n      metadata: createMetadata(),\r\n      // this plugin uses dynamic import for the Chart part and will only load it when it is used.\r\n      loadChart: () => import('./LineChart'),\r\n      // this plugin uses dynamic import for the transformProps and will only load it when it is used.      loadTransformProps: () => import('./transformProps'),\r\n      // this plugin uses dynamic import for the buildQuery part and will only load it when it is used. \r\n      loadBuildQuery: () => import('./buildQuery'),\r\n      // this is the plain object we want to move from incubator-superset\r\n      controlPanel: {...},\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also flexible for opt-out. If the part is so small. \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport default class BarChartPlugin extends ChartPlugin {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    super({\r\n      // metadata does not use dynamic import since it is so small.\r\n      metadata: createMetadata(),\r\n      // this plugin does not use dynamic import for the Chart, \r\n      // which could be because it is small and does not require additional dependencies.\r\n      Chart: BarChart,\r\n      // this plugin does not use dynamic import for the transformProps function\r\n      // which could be because it is small and does not require additional dependencies.\r\n      transformProps,\r\n      // this plugin does not use dynamic import for the buildQuery function\r\n      // which could be because it is small and does not require additional dependencies.\r\n      buildQuery,\r\n      // this is the plain object we want to move from incubator-superset\r\n      controlPanel: {...},\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2) The current architecture requires plugin registration to be synchronous.\r\n\r\nWhat happen during the `.register()` call is each plugin call the 5 singleton to tell that a visualization with this `key` exists.\r\n\r\nfrom [ChartPlugin.ts](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-chart/src/models/ChartPlugin.ts)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  register() {\r\n    const { key = isRequired('config.key') } = this.config;\r\n    getChartMetadataRegistry().registerValue(key, this.metadata);\r\n    getChartControlPanelRegistry().registerValue(key, this.controlPanel);\r\n    // notice that these register loader functions, not the actual code\r\n    getChartComponentRegistry().registerLoader(key, this.loadChart);\r\n    getChartTransformPropsRegistry().registerLoader(key, this.loadTransformProps);\r\n    if (this.loadBuildQuery) {\r\n      getChartBuildQueryRegistry().registerLoader(key, this.loadBuildQuery);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these registration happens during the **setup** phase of the app (see all the files under `setup` directory). All of these operations are executed **before any of the application (react, ui) code is called**. \r\n\r\nNow in the application code, there are a few places that utilizes these registries to figure out what it should do based on the `vizType`. \r\n\r\n* `SuperChart` uses these singleton registries to load the corresponding chart code.\r\n* `VizTypeControl.jsx` get the list of all vis types registered to the singleton to figure out what visualization to show in the dialog box.\r\n* The code for deciding whether to call legacy api or `/api/v1/query` will need to look up `metadata` from the `ChartMetadataRegistry` \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst metadata = getChartMetadataRegistry().get(vizType);\r\nif (metadata.useLegacyApi) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNone of this will work correctly if the plugin registrations are asynchronous, because the code mentioned above may be called before the dynamic import in this PR returns and enter the `then` clause.\r\n\r\nExample broken behavior will be \r\n* Some charts are broken because the app does not know the `vizType` (yet).\r\n* Some of the visualization are displayed in the dialog box, some are not.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1659771/77017848-cc022880-6938-11ea-999c-de1ebb45e8b4.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/600912882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/600919833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9187#issuecomment-600919833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9187","id":600919833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMDkxOTgzMw==","user":{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T00:14:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T00:19:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kristw Thanks for your thoughts on this\r\n\r\n> Generating MainPreset.js from the configuration file could be another solution as well.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially what I'm trying to take a step toward.

I'm really hoping we can make it much easier to work with plugins quickly.\r\n\r\nI've been wondering whether it could make sense to bring back some of the core plugins to the main repo too. The long tail and the community-contributed ones could live in other repos, but having the core in the main repo/package may help. PRing on two repos, publishing packages and bumping versions is tricky, and that's on top of the `npm link` stuff.\r\n\r\nIt's been many times that I want to work in a plugin and either really struggle or completely fail at it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/600990769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/601032105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9282#issuecomment-601032105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9282","id":601032105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTAzMjEwNQ==","user":{"login":"mgulaydin","id":60543307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQzMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60543307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin","html_url":"https://github.com/mgulaydin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgulaydin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T07:39:17Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T07:39:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hello

Thank you for this work, I look forward to it being in master and using it day to day. \r\n\r\nOne question (perhaps a bit of a tangent): Do we still need to point to NVD3's `/lib` directory in `MainPreset.js`? It now seems to work fine without that (loading from `@superset-ui/legacy-preset-chart-nvd3` directly), and editing stuff in the `/src` folder now works with this PR, which is _awesome!_. If that all seems as safe as it appears, the comments about this in `MainPreset.js` could also be deleted.\r\n\r\nRegarding your hot loading limitation, I did see some symptoms of it, but suspect it's just that D3 doesn't redraw on hot-reload unless something triggers in the the D3's data, triggering it lifecycle to run. For example, I tested an edit to the Big Number component, turning the _actual_ number to \"hello\" and it appears the hot-loading didn't run, but when you mouseover the chart, D3 is triggered to update. When doing a similar test with Treemap, there are no interactions that seem to \"kick\" D3 into action, so the change doesn't appear, and you need to refresh. I didn't see any cases where editing/saving `Chart.jsx` made any difference, for what it's worth.\r\n\r\nCopying some of your helpful instructions/comments from the Summary into `Contributing.md` would be helpful for future devs. \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for this, it's great work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/601415777/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/601416157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8638#issuecomment-601416157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8638","id":601416157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTQxNjE1Nw==","user":{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T21:04:48Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T21:04:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favor of https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9326","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/601416157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/601418587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9326#issuecomment-601418587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9326","id":601418587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTQxODU4Nw==","user":{"login":"ktmud","id":335541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud","html_url":"https://github.com/ktmud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktmud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T21:10:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T21:10:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for testing, @rusackas !
