The function was only designed to be evaluated at planning time with the interpreter, not with the full code compilation model in the project operator. While not ideal, the expected error that should be hit if this function is used in a select list is here in the FragmentContext when we go to populate the injected PartitionExplorer. https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/ops/FragmentContext.java#L458\n\nHas there been work to make partition pruning run the full code generation based expression evaluation? I would consider anyone hitting code generation issues with this function to be misusing it, I agree with fixing this poor error, but anyone executing this function outside of partition pruning is going to be running a very expensive operation for each record in their dataset and I can't think of a use case for it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/162696095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/162699376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/293#issuecomment-162699376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/293","id":162699376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjY5OTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"hnfgns","id":3476250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzYyNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3476250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns","html_url":"https://github.com/hnfgns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hnfgns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T23:02:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T23:02:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, I am aware of the thrown warning.
