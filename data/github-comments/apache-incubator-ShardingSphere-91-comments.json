SQL(can't executed) is equals with the No.5(executed correctly), the I wanna ask why and how to support range query in sharding strategyÔºü\r\n\r\nAside from performance considerations, we can find the most effective way to directly support this feature by broadcasting the whole Range query to all sharding db/tablesÔºåjust like  ‚Äò<>‚Äô operator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we can let it work well and

need to discuss this pull request:\r\n1. For standard sharding strategy, user need config precise algorithm (for =, IN) and range algorithm (for BETWEEN AND, <, >,  >=, <=). If range algorithm absent, the SQL contains BETWEEN should query all data nodes. That is correct, because user know they do not config range algorithm explicitly;\r\n2. For inline sharding strategy, user only can config precise algorithm via inline expression, and cannot config range algorithm. So throw exception when SQL contains BETWEEN may better than query all data nodes. If query all data nodes instead of explicit exception, user may missing the potential performance issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/573419900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/573430784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/3945#issuecomment-573430784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3945","id":573430784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQzMDc4NA==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-12T16:15:12Z","updated_at":"2020-01-12T16:15:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I found this error is puzzle for me in this case in past 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThere is a sharding table named 'test' with 4 actual tables with sharding key is 'id' column, then we will try proxy with:\r\n- 1.select * from test\r\n- 2.select * from test where id=102\r\n- 3.select * from test where id>102\r\n- 4.select * from test where id>102 and id<104\r\n- 5.select * from test where id<>102\r\n- 6.select * from test where id!=102\r\n- 7.select * from test where id between 102 and 104\r\n- 8.select * from test where id in (102, 104)\r\n- 9.select * from test where id not in (102, 104)\r\n- 10.select * from test where id>102 or id<102\r\n\r\nExecuting these No. 3\\4\\7\\10 SQL will occur the same exceptionÔºö\r\n```\r\n[2020-01-12 14:01:13] [C1000][10002] 2Unknown exception: [Inline strategy cannot support range sharding.]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I read `incubator-shardingsphere/sharding-core/sharding-core-common/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/core/strategy/route/inline/InlineShardingStrategy.java`, we can learn InlineShardingStrategy isn't support Range query: \r\n```\r\nPreconditions.checkState(shardingValue instanceof ListRouteValue, \"Inline strategy cannot support range sharding.\");
