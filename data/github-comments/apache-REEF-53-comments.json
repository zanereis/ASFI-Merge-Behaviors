Following are possible solutions I've thought:\n1. Avoid using REEF's Codec and define our own codec which throws Exceptions. This is simple, but we have another interface with same function, which REEF already has two (one in `o.a.r.io.serialization`, and the other in `o.a.r.wake.remote`).\n2. Make users throw an Exception which extends RuntimeException(e.g., `SerializationException`), and handle the specific exception when (de-)serializing fails. For this, users should throw the specific exception.\n3. Modify Codec to throw Exceptions explicitly. But this brings some changes in `reef.io` part, so I think it'd be good to discuss via `dev` mailing list first.\n\n@bgchun @afchung How do you think?

Sorry for late response.\n\n@tcNickolas , we should think in terms of the dependencies among REEF layers, too. As you know, `Tang` and `Wake` are conceptually very solid and well designed lower layers of `REEF`. Although the use of `REEFVersion` is just limited in test suites, that will make another dependency in `Tang` module. Actually, `org.apache.reef.util.REEFVersion` is in `reef-common` and `reef-common` has `Tang` dependency up to now.\n\nI prefer to keep the current architectural module design and dependency.

Sorry for the confusion!\n\nI have two questions:\n- I think it's great to let users know input/function list for retrying if aggregation has failed. But wouldn't it be expensive to keep all the information, especially when input is very large? Of course, using large input for a single Tasklet does not fit Vortex well.\n- We don't have the corresponding method in `VortexFuture` for Tasklet, right? I think it will be useful as well, but I'm not sure that calling `onSuccess` with the info is the best choice in both case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/171943361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/171991885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/768#issuecomment-171991885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/768","id":171991885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTk5MTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-15T15:30:28Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T15:30:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yunseong To simplify our error reporting for failed Tasklets on aggregation, I can think of a few other ways, but none of them are really great:\n1. Only allow a single type of `VortexFunction`: Currently we allow aggregating different types of `VortexFunctions`. By allowing only a single type of `VortexFunction`, we only need to report the input of the failed `VortexFunction` to the user instead of an input-function pair. However, this also limits the type of work that the user can do.\n2. Return the index of the failed input within the list of input-functions that the user supplies OR allow users to provide unique IDs for their input-function pair: This wouldn't really be helpful either, since the user will likely still need to keep the input-function pair locally to translate from index to input.\n3. Allow the user to configure how to report the failed Tasklet: 3 levels -- no report (or fail, though this is not ideal), report input on failure, and report input-function pair on failure. If we want to go with this, I'll still need to think about how to code it up, but this gives users more control over what can be done.\n\nAlso, I'm a bit unclear about the second point of your question. Could you please clarify?\n\nFinally, would you happen to know how mapreduce handles this situation? Perhaps we can gain some insight there. My understanding is that it only reports the task failure after the MR job is finished on the dashboard, but I could be wrong. Let me know what you think.

I totally agree with your idea to provide a way for users to handle the failed operations. And I think the current approach in this PR, seems best between the others described above.\n\nFor my second question, I'm sorry that I did not elaborate enough.\n\nI was wondering the case of single function, not aggregation. When a single Taklet has failed, users can't know what was the input/function, but are notified by `onFailure(Throwable)` in [VortexFuture](https://github.com/apache/reef/blob/master/lang/java/reef-applications/reef-vortex/src/main/java/org/apache/reef/vortex/api/VortexFuture.java) (Please correct me if I missed something). So my question was, if we want to provide such information about the failed aggregation, wouldn't it be natural to have the same logic for the single function?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/172163721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
