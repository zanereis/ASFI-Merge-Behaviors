I don't know how it works with athenz. But with TLS, if someone compromises the proxy, all they need is to know the name of a role, and they'll be able to impersonate it. Similarly, if the proxy is still active, they can just listen to who is connecting and accumulate role names. This is, of course ,because TLS doesn't use authData. Perhaps this isn't the case with athenz.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/440031812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/440032723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2986#issuecomment-440032723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2986","id":440032723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDAzMjcyMw==","user":{"login":"jai1","id":8659452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8659452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1","html_url":"https://github.com/jai1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T20:34:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T20:34:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> In the case of TLS, there's no auth data \r\nYou can have auth data with TLS too, in fact we have an implementation where we use athenz as auth data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/440032723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/440033186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2986#issuecomment-440033186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2986","id":440033186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDAzMzE4Ng==","user":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T20:36:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T20:36:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> You can have auth data with TLS too, in fact we have an implementation where we use athenz as auth data.\r\n\r\nWith TLS auth?

also want to address subscription-ownership usecase where pulsar enforces subscription access (consume, ack, admin-api) by only subscription-owner. One of the solution to configure sub-permission at namespace level implemented at #2981\r\nhowever, it still doesn't enforce unless admin explicitly grants sub-permission to set of principals at namespace level. \r\n\r\nAlternate solution to store subscription's principal-role at topic level in the topic-stat (`managed-cursor`) and whichever principal connects first to this sub will be the owner the subscription. So, whenever any principal connects to broker to access cursor, broker authorize connected principal against the role stored into cursor's stat (`managed-cursor`). \r\nAlso whenever, a subscriber application wants to change the subscription-owner there will be two options:\r\n1. create separate subscription for newly changed role and drop old subscription\r\n2. provide admin-api to change authorized role at `managed-cursor` , broker updates it and disconnect the existing connected consumers.\r\n\r\nEnforcing subscription-ownership authorization can be configured at namespace policies by adding flag : `enableSubAuthorization`. Broker stores \"role-name\" and performs \"sub-authorization\" only if flag is enabled for the namespace so, by default this feature will be disabled and can be enabled when user requires sub-authorization across different sub in the topic.\r\nSo, it will be super-set of #2981 and #899 so, we don't need #2981 with this feature.\r\n\r\n@merlimat @massakam any

> One of the primary goals of the custom binary protocol we came up with, was to have the client establish a \"session\" (either producer/consumer), attached to a topic, perform authentication and then let it publish/receive messages as fast as possible, with flow control to guard the rail.\r\nEg: we don't want to perform auth at every message, or to specify the topic name each time (which in many cases can be as long as the data itself).\r\nSo, mixing the \"session\" with RPC seems a bit complicated. Also guaranteeing ordering would be challenging as there would be no relation for different publish requests on the same topic.\r\n\r\ngRPC can establish a session for bidirectional streaming ! So IMO it could totally be used as the base protocol for Pulsar. The definition would look something like\r\n```protobuf\r\nservice Pulsar {\r\n    rpc exchange(stream BaseCommand) returns (stream BaseCommand);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInstead of passing auth info via `CommandConnect`, you would pass them as gRPC's `Metadata` fields (similar to HTTP headers).\r\nNote that this reuses the PulsarApi.proto, so a lot of code would be unchanged I think.\r\nYou would probably still need drivers because some functionalities require cooperation between the client and the server. But these drivers would be easier to write.\r\ngRPC also has auth mecanisms built-in that could maybe be reused and has built-in flow control.\r\n\r\nThat said I have started the work on a gRPC proxy. Consumption and production are working. I need to clean it up then I'll do a PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/440381769/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/440384538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/271#issuecomment-440384538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/271","id":440384538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDM4NDUzOA==","user":{"login":"cbornet","id":11633333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjMzMzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11633333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet","html_url":"https://github.com/cbornet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T18:37:32Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T18:37:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And
