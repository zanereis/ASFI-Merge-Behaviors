This may lead to a potential problem, which is, the underlaying connection can be closed by connection manager (see connection monitor). If this happens, this will lead to invocation failure since the resteasy client maintained in the map doesn't have lifcecycle management.\r\n\r\nShould we simply create Resteasy client every time and then drop it?

When the stream is read by an earlier class, the value of the field will be set to the default value because no value is available in the stream. However, this default value may adversely impair the ability of the earlier version to fulfill its contract.\r\n> Moving classes up or down the hierarchy – This cannot be allowed since the data in the stream appears in the wrong sequence.\r\n> Changing a non-static field to static or a non-transient field to transient – When relying on default serialization, this change is equivalent to deleting a field from the class. This version of the class will not write that data to the stream, so it will not be available to be read by earlier versions of the class. As when deleting a field, the field of the earlier version will be initialized to the default value, which can cause the class to fail in unexpected ways.\r\n> Changing the declared type of a primitive field – Each version of the class writes the data with its declared type. Earlier versions of the class attempting to read the field will fail because the type of the data in the stream does not match the type of the field.\r\n> Changing the writeObject or readObject method so that it no longer writes or reads the default field data or changing it so that it attempts to write it or read it when the previous version did not. The default field data must consistently either appear or not appear in the stream.\r\n> Changing a class from Serializable to Externalizable or vice-versa is an incompatible change since the stream will contain data that is incompatible with the implementation of the available class.\r\n> Changing a class from a non-enum type to an enum type or vice versa since the stream will contain data that is incompatible with the implementation of the available class.\r\n> Removing either Serializable or Externalizable is an incompatible change since when written it will no longer supply the fields needed by older versions of the class.\r\n> Adding the writeReplace or readResolve method to a class is incompatible if the behavior would produce an object that is incompatible with any older version of the class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/515374551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/515374765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4675#issuecomment-515374765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4675","id":515374765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTM3NDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"qixiaobo","id":2881751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODE3NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2881751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo","html_url":"https://github.com/qixiaobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qixiaobo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T09:14:34Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T09:14:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So

為此我調試了 dubbo 2.6.6 底層代碼, 由於對  dubbo 的同訊架構不熟, 我只能從我調試的代碼看出, consumer 的確有收到 provider 斷開, 但是 consumer 收到通知的是 HeaderExchangeChannel 這個類, 而我看了git 上修正的 file, 關鍵的修正是在 HeaderExchangeHandler 類中的 disconnected

\r\n你好。\r\n\r\n首先确认一个问题，就是你的provider的关闭方式是什么样的，我猜测你可能并不是正常关闭provider，而是使用kill -9这种方式关闭（或者其他的方式关闭，导致TCP通道并不是通过四次挥手来正常关闭的）。\r\n\r\n如果你是通过正常方式关闭provider的TCP通道的，则consumer端的触发过程应该是：\r\n`TCP关闭 -> Netty中的channelInactive -> Dubbo里的HeaderExchangeHandler#disconnected`\r\n\r\n此时，正如我的PR中修复的那样，所有的事情按照预期的方式发生。\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n反之，如果你是通过kill -9或者provider端直接断网等更加暴力的方式关闭，则provider并不会向consumer端发送fin报文。在这种情况下，对于TCP通道来说，consumer端会仍然认为provider端的进程是存活的、能够处理请求的。\r\n\r\n那为什么会触发HeaderExchangeChannel的close方法呢？\r\n我认为，应该是dubbo自身的服务发现机制触发的。即provider下线，zk上provider相应数据被删除，zk再通知consumer端，consumer端收到通知后，变更provider列表，此时发现该provider下线，这时候会主动关闭这条TCP通道，关闭的时候会调用HeaderExchangeChannel的close。\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/515881935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/515884505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/4555#issuecomment-515884505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4555","id":515884505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTg4NDUwNQ==","user":{"login":"jimiyi","id":13248985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ4OTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13248985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi","html_url":"https://github.com/jimiyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimiyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T07:49:42Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T07:49:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"url里面获取key为\"dubbo\"的值，2.8.4就是dubbox，2.0.2就是Apache
