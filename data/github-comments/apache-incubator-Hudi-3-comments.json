Feel free to pick the first subset of this list, to get started. \r\n\r\n**Goal:** \r\nUltimately, \r\n - Subsume most functionality of `HoodieWriteClient` for saving a dataframe back into a hoodie dataset, including all two storage types (COPY_ON_WRITE, MERGE_ON_READ) \r\n - Subsume most functionality of `HoodieReadClient` for running queries on a Hoodie dataset - including all three views (ReadOptimized, RealTime, IncrementalView)\r\n\r\nFor starters, \r\nMay be just support COPY_ON_WRITE & ReadOptimized/IncrementalView. \r\nA good test would be that \r\n - the `HoodieDeltaStreamer` will be able to use this to write data (all the things that are configurable like key extractors, schema providers etc... can be provided as options to datasource)\r\n- dataset can be queried incrementally (currently done by `HiveIncrementalPuller` or `HoodieReadClient::readSince`, `HoodieReadClient::readCommit` methods) or normally via the datasource like `HoodieReadClient::read(paths)`. \r\n\r\n**Writing** \r\n\r\n- Main thing here is to support modes for : upsert, insert, bulkInsert & if/how the saveModes map to these.. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#save-modes \r\n- User is able to specify a `key-generator-class` to control, record key and partition path as in DeltaStreamer\r\n- Internall payload will just be something (say HoodieRowPayload) that converts Row to GenericRecord, so we can probably fix this. May be for first cut, all we do is blindly replace the existing value with the provided record and we can leave this part pluggable where, by extending the HoodieRowPayload (all of this again stems from HoodieDeltaStreamer) \r\n- Schema is in the dataframe, so we need not worry about that. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Reading** \r\n- We can simply wrap the parquet source with additional filtering like in `HoodieReadClient::read` for normal queries.  (This already gives a DataSet/DataFrame)\r\n- Tricky things are how we support incremental queries and how to specify commit time for this. A powerful way is to have special columns right in the query like  \r\n  ```\r\n  select * from table where a = 1 // this does a normal query \r\n  select * from table where _mode = incremental and _commit_time_start = \"20171020120102\" // this is a incremental query\r\n  ```\r\nDon't know if this makes sense or doable. Something to ponder. Of course easier thing is to specify the mode & commit time as options for the `spark.read....` \r\n\r\n- Need to find a way to support `read(RDD<HoodieKey> keys`, kind of like a point look up query.. but may be better to leave it out also and support only like the `HoodieReadClient` \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce we have a basic datasource, we will integrate support for hive sync and merge-on-read and  and a structured streaming sink (in that order). Fun stuff
