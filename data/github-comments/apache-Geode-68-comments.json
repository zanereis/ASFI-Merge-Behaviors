Size of indexResults is defined by INDEX_THRESHOLD_SIZE. A new test case(_testLimitIsAppliedOnlyOnQueryResults_ in QueryWithRangeIndexDUnitTest.java) is added to verify it. \r\nNot sure what to do with failing tests, as they have assertions to check if limitAppliedAtIndex, and it will not apply as it checks INDEX_THRESHOLD_SIZE for limit at index.\r\nAlso, this can be fixed by the first proposal with fetching INDEX_THRESHOLD_SIZE every time the index is queried, but think that it is not the best solution as it will not take INDEX_THRESHOLD_SIZE into a count if it is not specified in the server startup command. This can lead to not collecting results in indexResults and the result of the query can be wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso, the PR name should be something like: _GEODE-9632: Add option to apply INDEX_THRESHOLD_SIZE on index results_, as it will not overwrite RESULT_LIMIT for printing results, just for collection of index results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/963041221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/963418088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6909#issuecomment-963418088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6909","id":963418088,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV845bJfo","user":{"login":"mivanac","id":48509724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac","html_url":"https://github.com/mivanac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T17:59:03Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T17:59:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @kirklund, @BenjaminPerryRoss, @boglesby, @jchen21, @nabarunnag and @gesterzhou, could you review this PR.\r\nThanks,\r\nMario","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/963418088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/963603124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7089#issuecomment-963603124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7089","id":963603124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV845b2q0","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T21:45:39Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T21:45:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 6 alerts** when merging 47d3e73d6342b4d862ba8e7da500e9f3c76fb9ca into eea10019d65f68b9ab1303762f568844e1755bbd -

From the net:\r\n> \r\n> On Windows, having to delete twice is somewhat to be expected. Gradle watches project directories on Windows and Mac. On Windows, you can't delete a directory which is being watched. Gradle stops watching the directory when nothing is left to watch in the directory. So if you delete all the contents of a directory, then Gradle will stop watching it. It takes some time though for that to happen. Trying to delete the directory twice is an option which should work.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried this, but I don't think Gradle's behavior is an issue for these particular tests. The compiler created a temporary, and Java creates those outside of the project directory. So Gradle wouldn't be watching those directories.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/981841544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/981966626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7060#issuecomment-981966626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7060","id":981966626,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV846h58i","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-29T19:56:46Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T19:56:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

You didn't \"make InterestType and DataPolicy enums\". I think you should correct this in the description of GEODE-9851. My understanding is you are basically changing how these existing classes are used internally in geode by using an instance of the class instead of its ordinal value. But I didn't see any introduction of Java Enum instances.\r\n\r\nGood point.\r\n`InterestType` was converted to an `enum` [here](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7103/files#diff-2dc76d4b46e63d7bdcd6debc3978915ee77d063a109d68c7e23a0ed3f9c58d47R23). The public version of this effectively same \"enum\" is unchanged to avoid API and ABI issues.\r\n`DataPolicy` is public and couldn't be safely changed to an `enum` without breaking ABI, though I am still testing this issue. The API can largely be preserved upon conversion to an `enum`. In the mean time I have deprecated the methods that would be replaced by `enum` generated methods in the future, say Geode 2.0 where we can break the ABI. \r\n\r\nI will work on the description for a better commit message.

Overall looks like a good direction! Here are some general comments and tips:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Prefer interfaces over abstract methods.\r\n> \r\n>     2. Standardize on one library instead of mixing them (such as AssertJ for assertions).\r\n> \r\n>     3. Is there a better word than \"txgrouping\" for module name and packages?\r\n> \r\n>     4. Declare variables and APIs with interfaces rather than implementations.\r\n> \r\n>     5. Always look for an interface to use instead of an implementation (such as InternalCache instead of GemFireCacheImpl) in both tests and product code.\r\n> \r\n>     6. Always minimize the scope of anything (class, method, variable, constant).\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments.\r\nRegarding the name, I do not have one that I really like. Other alternatives could be: txeventsgrouping, grouptxevents, txaware,...\r\nIf you like any of these or have any other proposal, please, let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/984299269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/984747290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7083#issuecomment-984747290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7083","id":984747290,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV846sg0a","user":{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-02T15:43:08Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T15:44:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @albertogpz we need to extract out the TX batching specific elements form the `GatewaySenderEventImpl` object. I replaced it with a implementation defined [metadata](https://github.com/pivotal-jbarrett/geode/blob/wip/wan-spi/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/wan/GatewaySenderEventImpl.java#L183) object.

This gets set on the event object when constructed via an override on [`AbstractGatewaySenderEventProcessor`](https://github.com/pivotal-jbarrett/geode/blob/wip/wan-spi/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/wan/AbstractGatewaySenderEventProcessor.java#L1310).

Just for my edification, will there be a similar issue in run2 in UpdateLocatorListTask, where it calls updateLocatorList with the response but we never check the hasResults field and it simply starts accessing the members and calling methods on it.\r\n\r\nI don't believe so. If we get a response with no results, then the consequence will be that we'll just mark all our old known locators as bad and not add any new ones (because the response doesn't contain any). This behaviour is unaffected by the changes in this PR, and hasn't caused problems up till now, so I have to assume that it's okay.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/989172355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/989180219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7172#issuecomment-989180219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7172","id":989180219,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV8469bE7","user":{"login":"Kris-10-0","id":24559178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU5MTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24559178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0","html_url":"https://github.com/Kris-10-0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kris-10-0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T20:43:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T20:43:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Had to force update to get the latest commits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/989180219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/989329878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7176#issuecomment-989329878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7176","id":989329878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV8469_nW","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T00:10:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T00:11:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The upgrade test failure is a known failure.
