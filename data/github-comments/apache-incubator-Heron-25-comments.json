is my review of this PR. Please bear with me.\n\n#### README.md\n\nFirst of all, your [README.md](https://github.com/prabhuinbarajan/heron-1/blob/ec5fbfe959aae67dc3f171099aefeb5c887a292c/heron/cli/src/python/README.md) makes little sense to me. What do you mean by \"pattern\"? I can barely understand what you mean by \"precedence\"? Do you mean \"order\"? What is \"To run/Test\"? What is `cp.heronrc.sample $HOME/.heronrc`? Do you mean `cp .heronrc.sample $HOME/.heronrc`?\n\n#### Code\n\nPlease fix indentation. We enforce Python indentation level to be 2. There are simply too many parts of your code that need to be fixed, and I don't have time to add specific comment and suggestion to each of them.\n\n#### Test\n\nPlease add test under `heron/cli/test/python`. Running test manually is not a viable approach in such a large project.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235340380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235353098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1158#issuecomment-235353098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1158","id":235353098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTM1MzA5OA==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T18:03:03Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T18:03:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`SchedulerMain.runScheduler()` also has overlapping code with `SubmitterMain.submitTopology` (for object initialization).\n\nWhat dead code are you referring to in `heron-executor.py`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235353098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235355454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1119#issuecomment-235355454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1119","id":235355454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTM1NTQ1NA==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T18:10:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T18:15:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since you group config by \"precedence\", I think it would be better to put each piece of comment on a separate line and stop supporting trailing comment.
