This suggestion is more about infrastructure so that we're not required to keep track of individual log files and how they were produced. We need this to decide whether or not we can skip a task based on existing results.\r\n\r\n@comaniac @kevinthesun I've updated the PR to include more concretely the ideas being discussed. I think an auto-tuning 'job' is distinct from a task as I am using it to refer to a series of tasks tuned sequentially (eg. tuning a network would be a 'job'). A JSON file containing all of the jobs is produced which contains information such as the start/finish time of the job, target/platform parameters and importantly the optimal configs for each task in the job. In principle this would allow you to 'revert' an auto-tuning job from the config library if you discovered you'd done something invalid during a job (I've done this a few times...) Keeping the entire history of a job can be controlled by a flag.\r\n\r\nI'm hacking one of the tutorial scripts to use the config library mechanism instead, `tune_with_config_library.py`. For convenience, here's the current tuning loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef tune_kernels(tasks,\r\n                 config_library,\r\n                 measure_option,\r\n                 tuner='gridsearch',\r\n                 early_stopping=None,\r\n                 log_filename='tuning.log'):\r\n\r\n    with config_library.tune(target):\r\n        for i, tsk in enumerate(tasks):\r\n            prefix = \"[Task %2d/%2d] \" % (i+1, len(tasks))\r\n\r\n            # converting conv2d tasks to conv2d_NCHWc tasks\r\n            op_name = tsk.workload[0]\r\n            if op_name == 'conv2d':\r\n                func_create = 'topi_x86_conv2d_NCHWc'\r\n            elif op_name == 'depthwise_conv2d_nchw':\r\n                func_create = 'topi_x86_depthwise_conv2d_NCHWc_from_nchw'\r\n            else:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"Tuning {} is not supported on x86\".format(op_name))\r\n\r\n            task = autotvm.task.create(func_create, args=tsk.args,\r\n                                       target=target, template_key='direct')\r\n            task.workload = tsk.workload\r\n\r\n            # create tuner\r\n            if tuner == 'xgb' or tuner == 'xgb-rank':\r\n                tuner_obj = XGBTuner(task, loss_type='rank')\r\n            elif tuner == 'ga':\r\n                tuner_obj = GATuner(task, pop_size=50)\r\n            elif tuner == 'random':\r\n                tuner_obj = RandomTuner(task)\r\n            elif tuner == 'gridsearch':\r\n                tuner_obj = GridSearchTuner(task)\r\n            else:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid tuner: \" + tuner)\r\n\r\n            # do tuning\r\n            n_trial=10\r\n            tuner_obj.tune(\r\n                n_trial=n_trial,\r\n                early_stopping=early_stopping,\r\n                measure_option=measure_option,\r\n                config_library=config_library,\r\n                callbacks=[autotvm.callback.progress_bar(n_trial, prefix=prefix)],\r\n            )\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546962151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546991587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4210#issuecomment-546991587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4210","id":546991587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Njk5MTU4Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T15:09:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T15:15:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"could due to different treatment on boundary values(0.5?)

I agree with the `job` part but not others.\r\n`config_library` still doesn't look like a \"library\". It's more like a job manager according to your proposal. The use case `config_library.tune()` is also weird, because we already use `tuner.tune` for each task. In my personal opinion, something like `job_manager.session()` would be more reasonable.\r\n\r\n* I didn't see the features you claimed neither in the PR or the example. Specifically, how to control if I want to record all configs or just the best one? how to resume a job? I don't think the current PR will skip any well-tuned job when resuming. I would suggest making that example more concrete and realistic first before the implementation so that we can all refer to it. I also think it's fine to create a separate tutorial for this feature. In summary, here are the points I wish to see in the tutorial:\r\n\r\n* How to create a config library and what's the controllable options.\r\n* How a config library resumes a job.\r\n* How to specify the log file mode (all or the best).\r\n* How to apply the log file generated by the config library to the rest building process.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/547252660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/547255031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4063#issuecomment-547255031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4063","id":547255031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI1NTAzMQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T04:50:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T04:50:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For 0.5 the tvm/node/node comes from 3rdparty/HalideIR submodule","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/547255031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/547280257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1756#issuecomment-547280257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1756","id":547280257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI4MDI1Nw==","user":{"login":"snowolfhawk","id":54352592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzUyNTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54352592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk","html_url":"https://github.com/snowolfhawk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snowolfhawk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T06:44:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T06:44:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"why this PR was not merged?

@comaniac. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if people can discuss a bit more in terms of API choices. I think we achieved the proposed goals. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, here are some \"complains\" I have by quickly looking into the API:\r\n\r\n- select.py was a bit confusing(it reminds me of select API of socket networking, but it is not?)\r\n   - It is more like a annotation API that annotates the tasks, can we treat it as a pass over the set of tasks(if that is what we want \r\n- The depend field in the autotvm should be documented, and we need to think about a better name (Seems the current specified behavior is to stop tuning x) and make use of dependent data\r\n\r\nI do not have time too think too deep into this. but perhaps others can do a review and discuss the possible candidates?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/548005028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/548031417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4223#issuecomment-548031417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4223","id":548031417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODAzMTQxNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T17:46:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T17:46:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"fixes

We were occupied by refactoring our implementation to combine with #4052. Thanks a lot for your proposal. Generating PTX or even SASS assembly is really an interesting topic and we may have some investigations and discussions on this later. As to the TensorCore CodeGen, I think maybe the data structure is not the only pain point. The root is in the programming model of TensorCore, in which the threads inside a warp are no longer individual threads and some high level information such as matrix_a/b, row/col_major, strides of a buffer, is required in low level operations.
