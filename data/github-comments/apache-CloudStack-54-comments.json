The graceful period is the problem. The calculation of this period is relaying (see https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/4.5.2/engine/orchestration/src/com/cloud/vm/VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl.java#L114) on the field `update_time` in table `vm_instance`. But if I look at the value  it seems it doesn't get updated. So the grace period has most likely always passed. \n\nI tried to do a workaround doing the following, I ran an update sql for every 5 seconds which updated the `update_time` for my router r-342 which I was migrating around esx cluster nodes:\n\n```\n mysql -e 'update cloud.vm_instance set update_time=NOW() where id=342;'\n```\n\nAnd the router didn't get rebooted:\n\n```\n2015-09-24 11:47:07,685 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-218:ctx-5849bd19) VM state report. host: 25, vm id: 342, power state: PowerOn\n2015-09-24 11:47:07,696 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-218:ctx-5849bd19) VM state report is updated. host: 25, vm id: 342, power state: PowerOn\n2015-09-24 11:48:06,462 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-55:ctx-84cd4323) VM state report. host: 19, vm id: 342, power state: PowerOn\n2015-09-24 11:48:06,471 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-55:ctx-84cd4323) VM state report is updated. host: 19, vm id: 342, power state: PowerOn\n2015-09-24 11:48:06,493 WARN  [o.a.c.alerts] (DirectAgentCronJob-55:ctx-84cd4323)  alertType:: 9 // dataCenterId:: 1 // podId:: 1 // clusterId:: null // message:: Router has been migrated out of band: r-342-VM\n2015-09-24 11:49:06,539 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-29:ctx-2a57d676) Detected missing VM. host: 19, vm id: 342, power state: PowerReportMissing, last state update: 1443095344000\n2015-09-24 11:49:06,539 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-29:ctx-2a57d676) vm id: 342 - time since last state update(-7197461ms) has not passed graceful period yet\n2015-09-24 11:49:07,719 DEBUG [c.c.v.VirtualMachinePowerStateSyncImpl] (DirectAgentCronJob-444:ctx-fdd4c055) VM state report. host: 20, vm id: 342, power state: PowerOn\n```\n\nWhich means this patch is not fix the root cause. To me the root cause is that `update_time` is not updated or the gracePeriod calculation is wrong.\n\nAny thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/142882541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/142899514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/829#issuecomment-142899514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/829","id":142899514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjg5OTUxNA==","user":{"login":"anshul1886","id":1712815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTI4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1712815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886","html_url":"https://github.com/anshul1886","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anshul1886/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T11:11:03Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T11:12:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"From code it seems to be getting updated and DB also suggests that.

For this I have added a logrotate script and a Patch file for 6.0.2 which is the same as for xenserver 6.0 with an extra entry for logrotate script. same entry is added in patch file for 6.2 and 6.5. In earlier version, you can find logrotate in /etc/cron.hourly. In later versions it was not available which broke the log rotate functionality.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/143478261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/143480210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/889#issuecomment-143480210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/889","id":143480210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzQ4MDIxMA==","user":{"login":"K0zka","id":3160079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjAwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3160079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka","html_url":"https://github.com/K0zka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/K0zka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-26T19:12:21Z","updated_at":"2015-09-26T19:12:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/143480210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
