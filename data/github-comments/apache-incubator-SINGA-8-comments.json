I am working on it. There may be three issues that need to think about: \r\n(i) maybe difficult to include graph module (please see resnet_module.py to see the different between layer model and module model). In this case, we may consider retain resnet_module.py, cnn_module.py, mlp_module.py indpendently, or to make another run.py function specially for graph.\r\n(ii) don't know how to show this example in the doc dist-train.md. So maybe in the doc we can still use doc_dist_train.py for
