What's driving this?\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nWhile it may not be necessary to provide confidentiality of the truststore, \"validation that the JKS is the JKS that the user expects\" is the very definition of integrity. Passphrases on java keystores (including truststores) provide both confidentiality and integrity. So the log message is incorrect: it *is* providing security value, by enforcing the use of integrity beyond file system permissions.\r\n\r\nWhile we don't necessarily need to enforce the use of integrity measures by requiring a passphrase (we could leave that to the user), I think it's better that we do... it encourages good security practices, and ensures that they must take active measures to select less integrity (by choosing a weak and well-known password like \"changeit\"). If we do what you propose, the default posture for the user will be shifted from one of having integrity and needing to take steps to reduce integrity, to one of not having integrity and needing to take action to provide integrity.

However, I think we should check if *any* item is non-empty, and if if any is non-empty, then assume we do want HTTPS, and then check that we have everything else we need and fail if we don't rather than fall back to insecure HTTP.\r\n\r\nIf we change that logic a bit, then it might make sense to consider the passphrases optional (but I'd still recommend to set them).\r\n\r\nAnother problem I noticed... I'm not sure we're checking for CLIENT_AUTH... we should be able to set that to lock down the monitor to only trusted users. Maybe I just didn't see it... I thought it was there, but I could be wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/420787712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/420791792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/646#issuecomment-420791792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/646","id":420791792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc5MTc5Mg==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T20:46:16Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T20:46:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> While it may not be necessary to provide confidentiality of the truststore, \"validation that the JKS is the JKS that the user expects\" is the very definition of integrity.\r\n\r\nYes, thanks for re-defining integrity for me ;).
