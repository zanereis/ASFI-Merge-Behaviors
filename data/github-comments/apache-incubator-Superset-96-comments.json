know it. Thanks for the link. A bit on overkill for my need to stage \"async queries\" for dashboards. I understand that this staging may be better addressed by a separate tool. So let's leave it at that.\r\nWhat about the possibility to refresh slices in the background, to have the fastest response time for interactive users ?\r\nThe use case I see would be to optionally add a cron expression to tables, to define a schedule at which tables are either changed or should trigger a refresh of caches. A worker would then simply transverse all the slices dependent on table, invoking them with force=True to refresh cache.\r\n\r\nTo some extent we could see this as extending the concept of async

cache warmup seems reasonable, and this recent PR seems like it does most of the work in that direction:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/3575\r\n\r\nThough typically in case of batch-populated tables you'd want to trigger the cache warmup after the batch job is done. That's we have a SupersetCacheWarmupOperator in Airflow at Airbnb. After the pipeline has loaded the table, we can warmup the Superset cache.\r\n\r\nI see the use case for scheduling data transfers, but that makes Superset becomes much more of a piece of infrastructure that needs to be monitored, capped and that can be abused in intricate ways. Being on-call for Superset I'd rather people use a tool designed for that purpose. I'd be ok with it if it can be turned on and off globally. Also you'd have to have ways to limit the size of the data/query to keep the workers

adding `sm.get_session.close()` to the bottom of `superset/__init__.py` fixes it.\r\n\r\nI have also experienced this bug. I think it happens because:\r\n\r\n* `superset/__init__.py` calls\r\n* `ConnectorRegistry.register_sources(module_datasource_map)` and that in turn does\r\n* `__import__(module_name, fromlist=class_names)` and that ends up calling\r\n* `flask_appbuilder.base.add_view()` which eventually calls\r\n* `sm.add_permissions_menu()` which calls\r\n* `find_permission_view_menu()` which does\r\n* `return self.get_session.query(self.permissionview_model).filter_by(permission=permission, view_menu=view_menu).first()`\r\n\r\nThe final call is executing a query against the database, and because of the Python dbapi transaction semantics we now have an open, idle transaction which blocks the `CREATE TABLE`. That happens because the table has a foreign key to `ab_user` and so creating the constraint on the database requires `AccessExclusiveLock` on `ab_user`, and the transaction can't get that if there is another open transaction somewhere that has selected it somehow.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear what the best place to fix it is.\r\n* you could file a bug against Flask-Appbuilder and propose that `add_view` should always leave the database without an open transaction - i.e. you call `self.sm.get_session.close()` at the bottom of `add_view` before `return baseview`\r\n* you could try and fix it in `appbuilder.security.manager` by closing the session before returning the found permission/view - but that will be invasive and you would need to apply it to all the `find_` methods and it might break other things if we are calling `find` midway through a transaction to create a new menu or whatever\r\n* you could fix it in `superset/__init__.py` by calling `sm.get_session.close` at the bottom of the file - that seems safe as we can be sure we shouldn't have any transactions in flight at that point\r\n* you might also be able to make it work by getting the migration command to use the same session as the security manager","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/334115725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/334119468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3559#issuecomment-334119468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3559","id":334119468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDExOTQ2OA==","user":{"login":"sdia-zz","id":2188624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODg2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2188624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/sdia-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdia-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-04T10:53:44Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T10:53:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Done
