`/opt/solr-10.0.0-SNAPSHOT` - Jetty is trying to hit the canonical URL - the permissions are on the symlink `/opt/solr` for `jetty.home`. This is easily fixable in Docker - set `SOLR_SERVER_DIR` to `/opt/solr-10.0.0-SNAPSHOT/server` (replace `10.0.0-SNAPSHOT` w/ version) instead of `/opt/solr`\r\n\r\nI am testing a fix locally on

A few quick questions for you:\r\n\r\n1. I noticed you left the `./gradlew check` box unchecked on the checklist in the PR description.  Running `check` isn't strictly required, as most committers will run it themselves before merging code.  But it does help give your reviewer a bit of extra confidence as it signals: \"Hey, the code quality checks and tests and all that passed for me, so this should be ready to review\".  So if you're willing, feel free to give that a try when you get a few minutes and let me know how it went.\r\n2. End-user-visible changes in Solr usually get mentioned in a \"change-log\" file that lives at `solr/CHANGES.txt`.  This file exists both to give users an idea of what might've changed release-to-release, but also as a way to give credit and recognition to all the contributors like you who helped.  If you get a few minutes, could you document this change by adding a bullet point under the \"Improvements\" section for the 9.2.0 release?  Alternately, if you don't have time or aren't sure what to write, I'm happy to draft that myself if you can tell me what name you'd like to be credited under.  (Some people use their full name, some people use a pseudonym or username, etc.)\r\n3. Lastly, since we're changing a Solr API we should probably update the documentation anywhere it might be mentioned.  Solr's main documentation, the \"Solr Reference Guide\" lives alongside the code in this repo at `solr/solr-ref-guide`.  It can be built using the command `./gradlew buildLocalSite` - more detail on this in the README [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/solr/solr-ref-guide/README.adoc).  The one place in particular that I know needs updated is the section [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/solr/solr-ref-guide/modules/deployment-guide/pages/cluster-node-management.adoc#clusterstatus-cluster-status).

I noticed you left the `./gradlew check` box unchecked on the checklist in the PR description.  Running `check` isn't strictly required, as most committers will run it themselves before merging code.  But it does help give your reviewer a bit of extra confidence as it signals: \"Hey, the code quality checks and tests and all that passed for me, so this should be ready to review\".  So if you're willing, feel free to give that a try when you get a few minutes and let me know how it went.\r\n\r\nThere was one failed test. JWT security issues. I'm rerunning the check to note the details of the error. Where is the test log located? To avoid rerunning the check.\r\n\r\n> 2\\. End-user-visible changes in Solr usually get mentioned in a \"change-log\" file that lives at `solr/CHANGES.txt`.  This file exists both to give users an idea of what might've changed release-to-release, but also as a way to give credit and recognition to all the contributors like you who helped.  If you get a few minutes, could you document this change by adding a bullet point under the \"Improvements\" section for the 9.2.0 release?  Alternately, if you don't have time or aren't sure what to write, I'm happy to draft that myself if you can tell me what name you'd like to be credited under.  (Some people use their full name, some people use a pseudonym or username, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have documented the changes.\r\n\r\n> 3\\. Lastly, since we're changing a Solr API we should probably update the documentation anywhere it might be mentioned.  Solr's main documentation, the \"Solr Reference Guide\" lives alongside the code in this repo at `solr/solr-ref-guide`.  It can be built using the command `./gradlew buildLocalSite` - more detail on this in the README [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/solr/solr-ref-guide/README.adoc).
