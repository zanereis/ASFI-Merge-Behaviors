Though this is untouched by these changes here, except for using a newer version of mshadow. It seems that this problem is caused by a recent change on 4/4 (PR 227) which sets kMaxGridNum in tensor_gpu-inl.cuh to MaxInt. The current MxNet master version includes a prior version of mshadow so is not affected by this change. \r\nMy code has to use the more recent mshadow. And in roi-pooling (and one other operator), kMaxGridnum is used in this expression:\r\ndim3 dimGrid(kMaxGridNum, (gridSize + kMaxGridNum - 1) / kMaxGridNum);\r\nwhich will may to integer overflows. Also dimGrid will be passed to CheckLaunchParam and this will anyway fail then as it expects the first dimension to be smaller than 2^16. \r\nWill try to fix this.\r\nAny other suggestion?  I put comments about this into PR 227 in mshadow. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/293415352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/293426028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5691#issuecomment-293426028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5691","id":293426028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzQyNjAyOA==","user":{"login":"mcxkarakoc","id":16512209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTEyMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16512209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc","html_url":"https://github.com/mcxkarakoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcxkarakoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-11T23:09:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T23:09:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@eric-haibin-lin Without printing, each batch takes about 700ms.

I don't see how the current localisation network can be _wrong_ since it basically gives the same results as lenet for vanilla mnist. \r\n\r\nIf you want to use STNs with cluttered MNIST, then sure, you'll probably need/want another type of localisation network. \r\n\r\nHowever that doesn't change the fact that the current lenet-stn example code is a bit broken because (1) there are no command line arguments to set the add_stn parameter to True (2) if add_stn is set to True there is no get_loc function to create a localisation network and you'll get an error.\r\n\r\nIf having a STN in vanilla MNIST seems overkill because it doesn't give any apparent performance advantages and you want to remove the example altogether and add another example with cluttered MNIST that's ok, but I think that the example is useful because it shows how to add a STN layer with a simple model and
