Tested locally for v1/v2 format. Also added support for updating the default value for v1/v2 format (v3 does not support index removal as of now).\n\nAdded a new class schemaEvolutionHandler that does bulk of the work. \n**Implementation details**\n- looks at schema from ZK and segment metadata. \n- computes the action required on a per column basis NEW_DIMENSION, UPDATE_DIMENSION etc\n- creates the new columns in a temp directory\n- computes the new metadata based on columns added\n- once all files are generated in temp directory, we update the original segment\n- returns the new segmentMetadata\n\n**TESTING**\nI did some manual testing where I ran schemaEvolutionHandler on a segment and started the server. Verified that we are able to retrieve the newly added column.\n\nTBD\n- write a unit test case to capture all data types (i manually tested for STRING dimension, we need tests for all data types for dimensions and metrics)\n-  write an integration test to create a segment with 5 columns and upload the schema with 5 + additional columns (1 for each data type and dimension/metric combination) and then start the server\n- refresh test case - similar to previous test case but we change the schema after server has started and loaded the segment. We need to either use refresh message or change the segment state to OFFLINE and back to ONLINE to force reload.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/230175128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/231821882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/161#issuecomment-231821882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/161","id":231821882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTgyMTg4Mg==","user":{"login":"atumbde","id":2695139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTUxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2695139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde","html_url":"https://github.com/atumbde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atumbde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T18:27:15Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T18:27:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We will need to restart servers if the schema changes.

For e.g. with refresh message based, we can control how many segments are getting re-loaded at once across cluster,table etc. With http we have to re-implement throttling. For long running tasks, we need to handle faults - what if controller goes down, what if server goes down or not responding etc. Helix provides us all these features already. \n\nIf the end goal is for user to know the result, then we can have a call to controller that waits until schema updates are processed before responding. Note that Helix message can also have status updates, current implementation of message handler in pinot does not use that feature.\n\nOther option is to have nodes automatically watch for schema updates and trigger segment refresh. It makes sense to do this once we have this feature well tested in production.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/231899953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/231907349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/161#issuecomment-231907349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/161","id":231907349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTkwNzM0OQ==","user":{"login":"antumbde","id":1058374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde","html_url":"https://github.com/antumbde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T00:44:36Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T00:44:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding http vs helix discussion : my main point is for operator to know\n1. success vs failure\n2.
