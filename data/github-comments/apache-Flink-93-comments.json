I tried to test your implementation and have found few things to do before merging this.\n\nFirst, It is about test cases. I think we should add a test case for KNN with quad-tree rather than modifying a test case without quad-tree. Also we need some test cases with non-executable configuration such as KNN with quad-tree and non-compatible distance metric. A method to create a test case with exceptions is described in scalatest documentation (**Intercepted exceptions** section in  http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_assertions).\n\nSecond, package definitions of `QuadTree` and `QuadTreeSuite` are not matched with directory structure.\n\nFinally, I think we need to add more detail description with some mathematical background of KNN and quad-tree (including link of your slides and papers which you referred to) to the documentation. Also we need examples and  description of parameters with default value.\n\nAbout rebasing, if you set `apache/flink` as remote `apache`, you can apply commands I suggested with renaming `upstream` to `apache`. You don't need to worry during rebasing. I also have copied branch of your `FLINK-1745` branch in my local machine. If you have some problems with rebasing, I'll rebase on `apache/master`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193580086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/193595361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1553#issuecomment-193595361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1553","id":193595361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzU5NTM2MQ==","user":{"login":"ramkrish86","id":3690658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTA2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3690658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86","html_url":"https://github.com/ramkrish86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T04:09:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T04:17:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske \nI was looking into the comments and the refactoring I can avoid by creating a new patch altogether.

These are used by for example the sorter, to get their memory segments from the memory manager. It would be simple to create them in the batch operators such that they don't immediately release to the mem manager, but only after the operator is disposed.
