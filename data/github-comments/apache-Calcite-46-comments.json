So, we can keep the current states that disable avatica's travis job that uses calcite master or merge this PR and re-open the avatica's travis job in  CALCITE-4880. \r\n\r\nAnyway, Feel free to close this PR as we can tracing this issue in CALCITE-4880 according to the result of the [discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/zyrftnms4p31lsvm93x1cynhnjnccbq7). // I also left a personal point of view in the discussion thread :)\r\n\r\n- If the result of the discussion is that the two modules are released uniformly, the problem of interdependence is not involved\r\n\r\n- If the result of the discussion is to maintain the independent release of the two modules and retain the early check of project compatibility, there may also be an opportunity to enhance the function of QUIDEM project, such as enhancing the ability of [ErrorCommand](https://github.com/julianhyde/quidem/blob/e4af1479471dae44c186aee4021dabde83d3532f/src/main/java/net/hydromatic/quidem/Quidem.java#L1175) to check the results, such as adding `ANYOF` semantic support, etc. then do some improvement on the `Bad library` test in [schema.iq](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/f1db79fb876ac9ba3c405283e99bb0438e4e97be/server/src/test/resources/sql/schema.iq#L67) .\r\n\r\nThen，I suggest that we can discuss it in JIRA. or mailing list discussion thread. \r\n\r\nThanks all for pay attention to this PR. @vlsi @NobiGo @julianhyde \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJincheng

However, it doesn't seem like a good approach since it is a misleading change. Having getDef() throw and marking the subinterfaces as functional means you have a suggested interface that doesn't actually work in the reflective provider. The change here avoids causing that unexpected/misleading behavior. As I said, if you want to get rid of the method moving forward, I'm fully supportive of doing
