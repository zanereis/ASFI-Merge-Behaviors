Do you mean by subcalssing the `CoreAdminHandler` and populate it explicitly?\r\n\r\nYes, subclassing and explicit populating in the subclass would be one way e.g. in `solrconfig.xml` simply this then:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<requestHandler name=\"/admin\" class=\"com.ijioio.solr.CoreAdminHandler\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if people can subclass then they can implement in whatever way suits them and they might want their class to be configurable e.g. like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<requestHandler name=\"/admin\" class=\"com.ijioio.solr.ConfigurableCoreAdminHandler\">\r\n    <str name=\"foo\">com.ijioio.solr.action.FooAction</str>\r\n    <str name=\"bar\">com.ijioio.solr.action.BarAction</str>\r\n</requestHandler>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd following that thought further, if we think that configurable custom use is better than non-configurable use then we could have the in-built `CoreAdminHandler` support configuration e.g. something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<requestHandler name=\"/admin\" class=\"org.apache.solr.handler.admin.CoreAdminHandler\">\r\n  <lst name=\"customActions\">\r\n    <str name=\"foo\">com.ijioio.solr.action.FooAction</str>\r\n    <str name=\"bar\">com.ijioio.solr.action.BarAction</str>\r\n  </lst>\r\n</requestHandler>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1184226533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1184231570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/931#issuecomment-1184231570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/931","id":1184231570,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5GlfCS","user":{"login":"cpoerschke","id":6458642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6458642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke","html_url":"https://github.com/cpoerschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T09:45:13Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T09:45:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually based on https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/releases/solr/9.0.0/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/handler/admin/CoreAdminHandler.java#L121-L127 it seems that a configurable `CoreAdminHandler` would not work.\r\n\r\nNot yet checked if `<requestHandler name=\"/admin\" class=\"com.ijioio.solr.CoreAdminHandler\"/>` is possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1184231570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1184410660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/931#issuecomment-1184410660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/931","id":1184410660,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5GmKwk","user":{"login":"ijioio","id":62468619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDY4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62468619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio","html_url":"https://github.com/ijioio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijioio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T12:51:26Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T13:31:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Not yet checked if `<requestHandler name=\"/admin\" class=\"com.ijioio.solr.CoreAdminHandler\"/>` is possible.\r\n\r\nIt is not, you can't redefine admin handler via `solrconfig.xml`. It is a special global handler of instance scale, not handler of core scale, so only one common instance is possible, it it expected to be redefined via `solr.xml`.\r\n\r\nIt is created only once during `load()` call of `CoreContianer` and can be overriden by defining `adminHandler` value in `solr.xml`:\r\n\r\n`org.apache.solr.core.CoreContainer`\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void load() {\r\n  ...\r\n    coreAdminHandler =\r\n        createHandler(CORES_HANDLER_PATH, cfg.getCoreAdminHandlerClass(), CoreAdminHandler.class);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`org.apache.solr.core.SolrXmlConfig`\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  private static NodeConfig fillSolrSection(\r\n      NodeConfig.NodeConfigBuilder builder, NamedList<Object> nl) {\r\n\r\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : nl) {\r\n      String name = entry.getKey();\r\n      if (entry.getValue() == null) continue;\r\n      String value = entry.getValue().toString();\r\n      switch (name) {\r\n        case \"adminHandler\":\r\n          builder.setCoreAdminHandlerClass(value);\r\n          break;\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return builder.build();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you try to define it on core level, via path mapping, it will end up calling init() and will fail.\r\n\r\n`org.apache.solr.handler.admin.CoreAdminHandler`\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public final void init(NamedList<?> args) {\r\n    throw new SolrException(\r\n        SolrException.ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR,\r\n        \"CoreAdminHandler should not be configured in solrconf.xml\\n\"\r\n            + \"it is a special Handler configured directly by the RequestDispatcher\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why I think redefining a set of actions via `solr.xml` looks more clean than redefining `CoreAdminHandler` (that in turn will explicitly collect actions) via the same `solr.xml`. This also solves the following problem: let's say, one developer create `CoreAdminHandler` with action `A`, and another developer create `CoreAdminHandler` with action `B`. If the user want to use both actions `A` and `B` user will get a problem, as user can override only one handler, i.e no handler \"chaining\" is supported.

From looking at the acos plot ( https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i2d=true&i=acos%5C%2840%29x%5C%2841%29 ) it's a 1 to 1 function, so well suited for comparison. I did a quick test which confirmed that the dot product is enough for comparison between values (which is all we need to do, as we cache the nvectors in the NVectorField). So we then have the following benchmark (with NVectorSortKey as this comparison and the fastest) :\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                   (num_points)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.NVectorSortKey              2000000  avgt    2   13.846          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.acosBM10                    2000000  avgt    2   45.620          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.acosBM17                    2000000  avgt    2   68.673          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.fastMathAcosBM              2000000  avgt    2  249.075          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.haversineBM                 2000000  avgt    2  289.814          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.mathAcosBM                  2000000  avgt    2  304.411          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.mathAsin                    2000000  avgt    2  323.126          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.sloppyAsin                  2000000  avgt    2   49.749          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.sloppyHaversinMeters        2000000  avgt    2  135.847          ms/op\r\nFastInvTrigBenchmark.sloppyHaversinSortKey       2000000  avgt    2   82.149          ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in Solr perhaps we can use NVectorSortKey for sort comparisons then.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1192560375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1192648270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/940#issuecomment-1192648270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/940","id":1192648270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5HFl5O","user":{"login":"madrob","id":1592330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTIzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob","html_url":"https://github.com/madrob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T14:44:57Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T14:44:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, I get it now.

I could sync this original branch with that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1201532930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1201673183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/585#issuecomment-1201673183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/585","id":1201673183,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5HoBPf","user":{"login":"markrmiller","id":448788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller","html_url":"https://github.com/markrmiller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T20:21:43Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T20:23:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don’t know that modifying jetty.xml is that common.
