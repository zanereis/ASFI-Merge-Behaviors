the GPU enabled R library (R version: 3.2.3) on Windows 7 today. Looks like it's working on the CPU but not on my GPU. The code seems to execute on the GPU (confirmed with GPU-Z), but error improvement stalls on the second round using example code (as above merged issue), and mx.nd.ones(c(2,3), mx.gpu()) generates a table of 0's not 1's.\n\nI'm using the latest files for everything, and the precompiled GPU package for R. I read in this thread: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/250, that indicates 'remove USE_CUDNN' to compile for Cuda Compute GPUs 2.1 (and lower). I'm using a 2.1 GPU. Could this be the problem? \n\nCould using an earlier 2015 release be a solution? Also might I have to compile my own GPU-enabled files without USE_CUDNN to fix this? I'm hoping I don't have to upgrade my computer to get his working as I'm only doing preliminary testing.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks, Gavin.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/192919248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/192927955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1592#issuecomment-192927955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1592","id":192927955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjkyNzk1NQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-06T16:36:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T16:36:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

I rebuilt it without cudnn.\nIt cost me my last hairs but in the end it was all quite doable.. :)\nThe 1st epoch gives exactly the same results between runs so I think I'm good.\n\nSo thanks again for
