It is the market leader in the hypervisor space, and NFS is one of the most popular storage protocols used with it.  Like the general hypervisor market, we have a large portion of our user community that relies on VMware with NFS.  Therefore, I will not remove my -1 from this PR until the necessary regression tests have been run.\n\nGenerally speaking, quality is the primary driver for merging PRs.  Selective test coverage (both in the number of tests run and diversity of environments tests are run against) is one of the largest quality issues we are currently working to address.  A test scenario being \"hard\" is not a valid reason to ignore it and move a PR forward.  Given that quality is the primary driver for the community, then PRs must wait to be adequately tested. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/248840184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/248840538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1642#issuecomment-248840538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1642","id":248840538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODg0MDUzOA==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-22T08:21:42Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T08:21:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mike-tutkowski I only see results for the new test suites for XenServer + Managed Storage.
