Search before asking\n\n-[X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.\n\n\n### Description\n\nI am currently trying out version 2.0, with 3 worker nodes, each worker thread number is set to 20, the total is limited to 60, and 2k+ tasks must be completed at 12:00-9:00 in the morning every day; in actual operation, it is in the running state The number of tasks far exceeds 60 (tasks of dependent types have been excluded), but due to the limited resources of the hadoop platform, the cluster actually limits 40 tasks. And because the current priority control is sorted according to the actual generation time of the task, instead of sorting according to the crontab time configured in the workflow where the task is located, we cannot control the priority of the batch task. For example, a running batch task that is configured to be triggered at 1:00 daily with the highest priority may not be generated until 3:00 due to waiting for the pre-dependent task, but a large number of ordinary tasks will be generated during 1:00-3:00 Priority running tasks, which causes high-priority tasks to wait a long time before running.\r\nso I hope:\r\n1 Ability to control the number of concurrent tasks actually running.\r\n2 Priority sorting logic: According to the priority and crontab time sorting of workflow/task configuration, there are two sorting schemes;\r\n    The first type, the set \"priority\" has the highest priority. Under the same crontab time, it is sorted according to the priority of the task;\r\n    The second is to sort according to crontab time first, the earlier the time, the higher the priority, and under the same crontab time, it is sorted according to the set \"priority\";\r\n\r\nI think that sorting by crontab time is better than the generation time of task instances (task instance number), because the configured crontab time is determined, and the generation time of task instances is uncertain.\r\nI don’t know if my logical understanding of the DS2 version above is correct. I look forward to replying and communicating. During our trial period, we were unable to complete the data warehouse task within the specified time window, and the completion time was 4 hours longer than our original scheduling system, under the condition that the hadoop cluster resources remain unchanged.\n\n### Use case\n\n_No response_\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n-[] Yes I am willing to
