The rabbit hole (pun intended) goes just a bit deeper than I originally expected.\r\n\r\n## Status quo\r\n\r\n### Current support\r\nOur current support assumes (or has the constraint) that what is passed to `RABBIT_ADDRESSES` is a comma-separated list of RabbitMQ `Address`es (host:port pairs). The intention here was to easily support clustered RabbitMQ servers without a TCP load balancer. However, this does not allow specifying scheme, which is a problem here when the scheme is `amqps` instead of `amqp`. In retrospect, the constraint on `RABBIT_ADDRESSES` may have not been the best choice.\r\n\r\n### Cloud providers\r\nDepending on how the connection properties are available from cloud providers, the viable solutions may change. It's a shame I didn't investigate this more before.\r\n@reshmik  @marcingrzejszczak\r\nCan you confirm what is available to you from the RabbitMQ cloud providers you are using? Is it just one URI string like the following (with one host only, I assume)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nampqs://user:pass@host[:port]/virtualHost\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr are the individual parts (username/password/host etc.) also provided as separate properties to some degree?\r\n\r\nI'll try to do my due diligence on this tomorrow so we can best support what most Zipkin users may end up using. I'm out of time to look this up today, though.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWithout a single property provided by the RabbitMQ Java client that can parse the [RabbitMQ URI spec](https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html) **for multiple hosts**, it's not easy to support both of these options. To be fair, the URI spec doesn't define multiple hosts as valid.\r\n\r\n## Quickest solution?\r\n\r\nThe flag for using TLS can be set separately, `ConnectionFactory#useSslProtocol`, if we want to expose that as a new property.\r\nHowever, note that this spits out the following error because peer validation is not being used without configuring the trust manager (see [Key Managers, Trust Managers and Stores](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html#trust-levels)). Though no one in the linked Spring Boot issue seemed to be asking for this part to be configurable.\r\n```\r\n2017-11-29 22:58:03.680  WARN 64970 --- [           main] c.r.client.TrustEverythingTrustManager   : This trust manager trusts every certificate, effectively disabling peer verification. This is convenient for local development but prone to man-in-the-middle attacks. Please see http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html#validating-cerficates to learn more about peer certificate validation.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a flag exposed for that as say `RABBIT_SSL_ENABLED`, used in combination with passing just the `host:port` to `RABBIT_ADDRESSES`, I believe things will work (warning log above withstanding).\r\n\r\nThis solution feels like it avoids fixing the limitations with our current configuration options, which may be fine if it works for the vast majority of users, but I fear it may not.\r\n\r\n## Parse all the URIs\r\n\r\nA more robust solution compared to above might be the following, which tries to define a version of the [RabbitMQ URI spec](https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html) that handles multiple hosts.\r\n\r\nI think ideally we would be able to take a string that optionally contains a scheme, username, password, virtual host, port, and requires at the least one host but has potentially multiple hosts. Then, being able to pass that to the RabbitMQ client and let it parse it would be a cherry on top. Until that happens, we'll have to parse it ourselves.\r\n\r\nThere are subjective decisions that need to be made for what is allowed in the string, though. We could take inspiration from the [MongoDB client's format](http://api.mongodb.com/java/current/com/mongodb/MongoClientURI.html).\r\n\r\n>The format of the URI is:\r\n>\r\n>   `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]`\r\n\r\nWhich would make ours something like:\r\n```\r\n[(amqps://|amqp://)][username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[hostN[:portN]]][/virtualHost]\r\n```\r\n* scheme is optionally specified as `amqps://` or `amqp://`; absence implies `amqp://`\r\n* `username` and `password` are optionally specified following the scheme; `guest`/`guest` are the default if absent\r\n* `host1` is required\r\n* `port2` is optionally specified; it is `5672` by default or when the scheme is `amqp`; when the scheme is `amqps` it defaults to `5671`\r\n* a comma-separated list of host:port can optionally follow `host1`\r\n* `/virtualHost` can be optionally specified at the end of the string, defaulting to `/` in its absence\r\n\r\nWe could also consider parsing [query parameters](https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-query-parameters.html) at the end. This could provide a way for users to pass the necessary files for full TLS configuration with a trust manager.\r\n\r\nReasonable (IMO) limitations the above implies are that all hosts would be connected to using the same scheme, authentication, and virtual host.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSorry for the length of the above. I'm glad to hear other solutions if anyone has them, or feedback on anything above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/347892145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/347907117","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1828#issuecomment-347907117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1828","id":347907117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzkwNzExNw==","user":{"login":"shakuzen","id":8924140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjQxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8924140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen","html_url":"https://github.com/shakuzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shakuzen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-29T16:02:31Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T16:18:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> does XXX_zh means traditional chinese while zh_CN means simplified chinese?\r\n\r\nFrom [jquery-i18n-properties](https://github.com/jquery-i18n-properties/jquery-i18n-properties/):\r\n> It loads and parses resource bundles (.properties) based on provided language and country codes (ISO-639 and ISO-3166) or language reported by browser.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the locale is supposed to be language code _ country code.

Please do that https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\r\n\r\nIf you are overloaded, there are generally a couple ways to address it. For example, you can send less load (by lowering the sample rate of the applications). You can also increase the count of connections to elasticsearch ES_MAX_REQUESTS defaults to 64: https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server#elasticsearch-storage. If you do this, update to the latest zipkin server as it can handle more load. If you then start to get errors from elasticsearch, you'll need to scale that accordingly.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.

There are modules and they are taking configurations and so on. If you start the `zipkin-server.jar` with `STORAGE_TYPE=influxdb` it will look for an influxdb running on localhost:8086.\r\n\r\nYou can start one using Docker:\r\n```\r\ndocker run -p 8086:8086 -i influxdb\r\n```\r\nThe storage module has queries to support:\r\n\r\n* writes\r\n* get spans/traces\r\n* get span/trace\r\n* dependencies\r\n\r\nIt should be almost everything there.
