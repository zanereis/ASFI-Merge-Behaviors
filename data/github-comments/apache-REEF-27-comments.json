Note that I have _not_ looked at any of the implementation details, but focussed on APIs only. Some global comments on that:\n- Please consider using the JCIP annotations to document the thread safety concerns of this code.\n- Please add JavaDoc to all `public` methods and classes. At the very least, add them to the methods in all `public` interfaces.\n- Please consider the package-level javadoc as an opportunity to give the user and reader of the code guidance as to what the packages are for, in addition to what they contain.\n- Tang can instantiate an object based on a `private` constructor. Hence, making constructors `private` affords you greater freedom for future code changes. Consider doing that for all constructors which have an `@Inject` annotation.\n- Some package-private classes have `public` constructors. That seems unnecessary.\n- The evaluator restart logic is dangerous. If you suffer from a bug where _every_ evaluator crashes upon launch, it will request new evaluators and launch them, just to see them fail. Consider adding a counter for the max number of failed evaluators.\n- Vortex relies on `Serializable` objects for the user code. This is very attractive from a usability perspective (exhibit A: Spark), but can also lead to enormous complications as those objects can refer to lots of local state (exhibit B: Spark's closure cleaner). For REEF, we erred on the side of making the latter impossible via Tang. I understand that this isn't the goal for Vortex. However, it would be good to have an idea of how to mitigate these issues before lots of code is written against the current API.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/126745910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/126781044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/327#issuecomment-126781044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/327","id":126781044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjc4MTA0NA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T18:46:10Z","updated_at":"2015-07-31T18:46:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[REEF-pull-request-windows3

I have done a pass. A couple of high level notes:\n1. Tang doesn't respect `private` on constructors. Hence, you can make them `private` if they are only ever to be invoked via Tang.\n2. Please add JavaDoc on all public methods, at least those defined in interfaces.\n3. Please add JavaDoc to all public classes, interfaces and enums.\n4. `DriverRestartManager` could be structured like a Driver, with the various event handlers as inner classes. Do you think that would be beneficial to the code structure?\n5. `DFSEvaluatorPreserver` needs some refactoring. The code doesn't make use of the fact that it is now allowed to maintain state between invocations of the `record...()` methods. For one, we could hang on to a `FileSystem` instance. Or, better yet, a `Writer` to record these messages. We would decide how to implement the writer (append or append-by-overwrite) once in the constructor of `DFSEvaluatorPreserver` instead of on every call to the `record...()` methods.\n\nAlso, this PR needs testing on actual YARN clusters before merging. Let's drive it to code-level consensus first, and then ask the mailing list for help with testing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/126833801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/126833830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/328#issuecomment-126833830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/328","id":126833830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjgzMzgzMA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T23:21:38Z","updated_at":"2015-07-31T23:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@beysims I'll do a pass.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/126833830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/126836257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/328#issuecomment-126836257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/328","id":126836257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjgzNjI1Nw==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-31T23:38:48Z","updated_at":"2015-07-31T23:38:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"During the build `lang/cs/Org.Apache.REEF.Client/Properties/Resources.resx` is modified.
