Now this PR has other unnecessary commits in it and the it looks not compiling well. Would you clean the commits?\r\n\r\nI don't use `merge` when updating the local brach with the latest master, instead I use `rebase`.\r\n\r\nIf I'd recover from this state, I may use following steps:\r\n1. Rename the current branch to different name, to clean-up the branch.\r\n    e.g. `git branch -m NIFI-3611-bk`\r\n\r\n2. Update the master branch to the latest. e.g.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ git checkout master\r\n    # the name 'upstream' may be different, it's pointing github.com/apache/nifi.git\r\n    $ git pull upstream master\r\n    ```\r\n3. Create new branch from the latest master.\r\n    e.g. `git checkout -b NIFI-3611`\r\n4. Port the 1st commit from the old branch.\r\n    e.g. `git cherry-pick 27d91507a00e095e212c1c96856806f53e868b82`\r\n\r\n    At this point, your new NIFI-3611 branch is synched with the latest master and has the 1st commit.\r\n\r\n5. Apply the changes you wanted to make at the last commit. I recommend applying changes manually instead of cherry-picking here. At this point, your branch has the updates to incorporate review comments.\r\n6. Push it to update this PR.\r\n    e.g. `git push -f origin NIFI-3611`\r\n    You need `-f` option to forcefully push the new commits\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/452943657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/453112046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2743#issuecomment-453112046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2743","id":453112046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzExMjA0Ng==","user":{"login":"zisisp","id":684407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/684407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp","html_url":"https://github.com/zisisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zisisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T14:21:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T14:21:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, what is the status of this? is it going to be merged?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/453112046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/453113733","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3133#issuecomment-453113733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3133","id":453113733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzExMzczMw==","user":{"login":"SavtechSolutions","id":20711595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzExNTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20711595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions","html_url":"https://github.com/SavtechSolutions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SavtechSolutions/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T14:26:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T14:26:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@colindean you might want to have another look at the DBCPServiceTest.testIdle(), as it's failing the whole build intermittently.

As we bring things into the system we're taking on license/notice/dependency/code management burden and for things which we dont have an easy path to test with it can be tough.  To me, this is a perfect example of an integration which is best held/supported/promoted by the vendor and the NiFi community could then link to it but not include it in our apache distro.

That is the first clue to me that this might make more sense as something the Influx team just puts on their website and supports.  They can tell their customers/users to grab the nar and throw it in their favorite nifi distro and away they go.  This reduces the burden for the nifi community to review/test it and gives Influx total control.\r\n\r\nThe other clue that things aren't quite right in this case is that the github account we see for a lot of this says 'Influx Engineering'. We really need to be careful about such things.

So glad you got a chance to take a look. So, the motivation behind the change was purely to improve navigational efficiency and response time for end users in quickly being able to identify and correct a started processor that somehow had an incorrect configuration; limiting the amount of flow files that can traverse through the misconfigured processor. In working with both novice and advanced users of NiFi for the last year, I've had consistent requests that there be a simple button that allows a user to directly stop a processor and automatically allow editing of the processor's properties. The current navigational route from viewing a started processor's details (read only)  to editing its properties in the configure processor modal was always reported as a bit cumbersome: (ie - user clicks to open the  processor details modal of a started processor and notices a properties change is necessary > user clicks to close the processor details modal > user right/left clicks to stop the processor > user clicks to open what looks like the same processor details modal dialog, but now allows them to edit the desired properties).  I tried to keep the changes as simple as possible when I sent the PR. In this change, the processor details modal should  only present the \"Stop & Configure\" button when its launched directly from the canvas interface to limit any conflicts with  where it is used on other interfaces (ie: Summary, etc etc). ... as well it will disable the button if the processor is in any state other then RUNNING or the user demonstrates insufficient permissions. If there are other concerns you have, please let me know what those are and I can work to get those addressed. My thanks again for taking a look!\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\n--alex\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/459339774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/459378372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3281#issuecomment-459378372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3281","id":459378372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTM3ODM3Mg==","user":{"login":"mosermw","id":10587698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTg3Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10587698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw","html_url":"https://github.com/mosermw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T15:07:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T15:10:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For what it's worth, I'm super in favor of user experience improvements like this.

I get super annoyed when I stop a long running processor that's currently using threads and I have to Refresh the canvas waiting for it to stop.

I'll sit tight for input from the others and next week I'll work to refactor to the consensus. I have a working branch right now that does have the polling logic within the terminate dialog under a  \"WAIT\" button (in lieu of the \"NO\" button) and provides feedback to the user on the modal as to how many threads remain active. I would say that being able to stop and terminate immediately is highly desired by some of the users I've discussed the feature with, but if you think that has deleterious effects elsewhere in the application, I can take the terminate logic out entirely if needed.

Then, as mentioned, provide the option to force the termination immediately (as it may be the only viable option).\r\n\r\nAlso thinking it'd be nice if the user chooses to wait it out, to close that dialog and allow them to continue to work in the app. After a certain amount of time, reopen the dialog to remind them we're still waiting and again provide the terminate option. \r\n\r\nThanks for your work on this @aeaversa . I will plan on testing this out later and provide more detailed feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/459786153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/459822707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3287#issuecomment-459822707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3287","id":459822707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTgyMjcwNw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T18:34:22Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T18:34:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, nice touch with removing the engine from the allowable values.

How about this... we present the processor configuration dialog, with its \"Apply\" button disabled, as soon as they hit the \"Stop & Configure\" button on the processor details dialog, thereby allowing the user to begin to view/change properties while the threads continue to closeout normally with a subtle feedback mechanism on the configuration dialog that displays the active thread count to the user as the processor is polled (i.e. \"Stopping..3 active threads remain\"). From there we can simply present a \"Terminate\" button to the bottom of the dialog, should the user want to elect to do so. Once the process reaches a zero thread count,  we can simply \"enable\" the Apply button and remove the \"Terminate\" button and the form would function as originally intended.
