@basvanbeek @adriancole I finish the draft of transfer(not debug yet). \r\n\r\nThe most important parts of these codes are about SegmentRef and Span's peer.\r\n- Span's

me use an example to demo the important parts.\r\n### FrontEnd -> BackEnd\r\n- Span of client in FrontEnd should have a peer, which includes ip(v4/v6/hostname)+port, representing BackEnd service endpoint. In sleuth example: `localhost:9000` in `Frontend#callBackend`\r\n- Span of server in BackEnd should have a ref, which includes:\r\n   - application, instance, service from root span of the whole trace, FrontEnd in this case\r\n   - application, instance, service from root span of parent segment, FrontEnd in this case too.\r\n   - peer in Span of client. In sleuth example: `localhost:9000` in `Frontend#callBackend`\r\n\r\nThe most important, I need Zipkin team to recheck, is about how I build peer from endpoint. I find in many cases, endpoint may miss.
