@kumm , a few comments:\r\n\r\n1. the map handling was intentional cause it doesn't target big numbers generally but only small ones (config). However we can enhance it a bit as you propose.\r\n2. the convertTo new handling is however a regression in term of performance and behavior since double numbers become bigdecimal so you need to adapt. Don't forget to revert the deletion you did in the test, it is more important to support double than BigDecimal.\r\n\r\nOverall I think the idea is good but ensure you use (in order) these types:\r\n\r\n1. int\r\n2. long\r\n3. double\r\n4. BigDecimal\r\n\r\ncause it is the way it is casted in practise and rarely with a type check before (kind of implicit contract in term of usage I'd say).\r\n\r\nCan you update this PR to support double please and add it back in the test?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/299789241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/comments/299956153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/johnzon/pull/7#issuecomment-299956153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/johnzon/issues/7","id":299956153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTk1NjE1Mw==","user":{"login":"kumm","id":254770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDc3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/254770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm","html_url":"https://github.com/kumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-08T18:48:09Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T18:48:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yes,

I suspect the second case is where you were considering relfection!!!

You have behaviour which changes when different jars are installed which creates an unreliable system.\r\n\r\nThe point of modern OSGi designs is to be able to see that the system will work before even assembling the runtime simply by having the resolver tell you so.
