In practice I'm not sure it is ever used this way.  The go code was likely modeled after the Java or C++ protocol code which still maintains the inputProtocol, outputProtocol, inputTransport, outputTransport semantics.  It looks like the constructors were simplified when go was added, so I see nothing wrong with this further simplification.  The appveyor issue with concurrency_test seems to be happening enough we should look into it again but it isn't related to these changes - that is a C++ concern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/511356879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/511369735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1831#issuecomment-511369735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1831","id":511369735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTM2OTczNQ==","user":{"login":"dcelasun","id":144373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun","html_url":"https://github.com/dcelasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcelasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T11:45:27Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T11:45:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the PR.

Yes auto forward tracing headers is a common use case, but there might be other headers that's inappropriate to forward.\r\n\r\nOther reasons I don't want to auto forward are:\r\n\r\n1. From https://golang.org/pkg/context/ you can see that as of go 1.12 there's no way to actually remove a value from a context object (a hack to workaround that is that instead of storing a string value, we store a struct with a string and a deleted flag so that when we need to remove a value we just update it with deleted flag set to true, or just treat empty strings as deleted, or something like that)\r\n2. We actually call the reading helper functions [`GetReadHeaderList`](https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift#GetReadHeaderList)/[`SetReadHeaderList`](https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/thrift/lib/go/thrift#SetReadHeaderList). If we want to do auto forward we would need to rename it into `GetHeaderList`/`SetHeaderList` (because there's only one list now), which is a breaking change (but maybe that's OK since that's not in a release yet)\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, it would not be too hard for users to forward all/some headers if they have some middleware setup. They just need to add an extra step like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nctx = thrift.SetWriteHeaderList(ctx, thrift.GetReadHeaderList(ctx))  // forward all\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar AutoForwardHeaders = []string{\r\n  \"Trace\",\r\n  \"others\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nctx = thrift.SetWriteHeaderList(ctx, AutoForwardHeaders)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, an idea is that we add a field and a function `TSimpleServer`, to setup the header list that auto forwards, and call `SetWriteHeaderList` where we currently inject the read headers into `ctx` right now. So users only need to setup that once before serving and it will work for all requests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/522075400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/522088699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1845#issuecomment-522088699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1845","id":522088699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjA4ODY5OQ==","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T17:29:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T17:29:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">Alternatively, an idea is that we add a field and a function TSimpleServer, to setup the header list that auto forwards, and call SetWriteHeaderList where we currently inject the read headers into ctx right now.
