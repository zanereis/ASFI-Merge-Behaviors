removes the old copyright notices from the license messages. In addition, many files were missing Apache licenses, so they have been added. Additionally, replaced OCO Source Materials notices with Apache licenses where they were found.\n\nTests completed successfully [here](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-OnDemand/27/).\n\n@lresende @dusenberrymw One thing I am a bit confused about is that some files (such as AParserWrapper.java) at the end of the GitHub \"Files Changed\" view show up with \"No changes\" messages even though it is showing that the files have changed. If you click the View button for the file, you see that the file contains the correct information with the correct license. If I check my local history on my machine, I see that for a file such as AParserWrapper.java, the old license message with the copyright has been replaced with the new license message without the copyright. So I'm not sure why the \"No changes\" messages appear. Maybe it's an artifact of changing so many files?\n\nAn additional point to be aware of is that updating the licenses was more difficult that I originally expected because files in the project have a mix of Unix-style (LF) and Windows-style (CR+LF) linefeeds. The linefeeds in the project should probably be standardized to Unix-style to prevent such difficulties from occurring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/162031177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/162047246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/8#issuecomment-162047246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/8","id":162047246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjA0NzI0Ng==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T18:40:56Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T18:40:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great, I'll merge this in.

Your updates look good. However I'm having a little bit of a difficulty. The second commit in the PR contains several updated files but the dml-language-reference.md was not up-to-date before the updates. I would cherrypick the second commit except for the needed dml-language-reference.md which is in the third commit which has 59 files that have already been previously committed. I'm having a little problem doing a diff comparison between my local master and the PR version of dml-language-reference.md (git diff pr-18^..master -- docs/dml-language-reference.md) (Possibly because of the multiple parents of commit 3?).\n\nI hate to ask, but would it be possible to do a new pull request with your updates ((1) delete language reference html file and (2) update other 6 files based off the latest master)?\n\nAlso, I noticed you are working on your master branch. Perhaps creating another branch to work on (one branch per pull request) would be a little bit safer and easier than working directly on your master branch? That way you can create a branch based off of the latest code from master, commit your changes to the branch, push the branch to your GitHub, and file a PR for the changes on the branch without affecting your master branch at all. A benefit of this approach would be that you can always pull to your local master from GitHub SystemML and have the latest official code on your master branch. You can then make a branch off of master and commit code, and your commits don't affect your master branch, which is always clean.\n\n@lresende Luciano, our GitHub/git expert, do you have anything to add?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/164549894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/164558393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/21#issuecomment-164558393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/21","id":164558393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDU1ODM5Mw==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T21:02:01Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T21:02:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great job @gweidner !\n\nPR merged.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/164558393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/164565615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/20#issuecomment-164565615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/20","id":164565615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDU2NTYxNQ==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T21:29:55Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T21:29:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hello @oza .

SPARK_HOME and SYSTEMML_HOME. However, note that SPARK_HOME is not set by default when we install Spark. This is something the user has to do. You can keep that change, but please change DEFAULT_SPARK_HOME to something generic (e.g., _/usr/bin/spark-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-hadoop2.4_) and put a comment noting that users must override it by pointing to Spark installation on their cluster.\n\n2) Reg. Spark defaults like driver-memory, please keep them for now. This is because the values in spark-defaults.conf affects all users and cluster-wide applications.

Thanks for the PR.

Let us make that section as the one-stop for all possible ways of running SystemML -- standalone, Hadoop, Spark, JMLC, MLContext, etc. Each of this can be a subsection. We now have this information in various different places. Let us consolidate and make it flow better through this PR.

There is a lot of value to that idea. Perhaps I can do that as a separate PR since reorganizing seems like a separate unit of work.\n\nWith regards to the **DML and PyDML Programming Guide**, I created it for a complete beginner to start becoming familiar with the absolute basics of the language (data types, matrix indexing, control statements, etc) rather than being a guide for ML. It should probably be renamed to something like **Beginner's Guide to DML and PyDML** or **Language Basics** or something like that. I think you are right in that a **DML and PyDML Programming Guide** should detail practices such as writing efficient ML code that scales.

Version numbers can be extracted to a yml file for the documentation so that the version can be stored in a single place and it can be referenced from multiple locations. Ideally it would be nice if that version number in the yml file could be automatically generated based on the version number in the pom. Maven resource filtering might allow that to work. It would also be nice if the particular yml file/value being updated was gitignored so that it didn't need to be committed.

Please, try to add the related code to VariableCPInstruction.processInstruction (createvar). If the newly created matrix object is marked as update in-place, then allocate the matrix block similar to DataConverter.createDeepCopyExecutionContext. The parfor optimizer should only mark the hop for update in-place, the flag is then compiled into the instruction and during runtime you can create the special matrix object during createvar instructions. Note that you need to update Hop.clone() too, otherwise the update in-place flag is lost on deep copy of HOP DAGs during dynamic recompile. For debugging your change, please, double check that your update-in place flag is still existing on processing the related createvar instruction.
