`superset/config.py`, I see no reason why `DATA_DIR` needs to be created so early.\r\n\r\nNone of the uses inside the `config.py` file actually require that `DATA_DIR` exist before `config.py` itself finishes loading.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that it should be fairly safe to move its creation after the point where `superset_config` is imported.\r\n\r\nThe caveat is that any code inside `superset_config.py` should also either assume `DATA_DIR` will only exist after `superset_config.py` is finished loading or it should create `DATA_DIR` itself.\r\n\r\nWhile #3238 allows an environment variable to point `DATA_DIR` to a writable location, providing a workaround for this issue, I think it's still valuable to allow `superset_config.py` to override it so that setting an(other) environment variable is not required.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, I can create a

In other cases people want to aggregate data.  There's also the fact that with WebGL / Deck.GL we can actually afford to visualize hundreds of thousands of data points, and aggregation as necessary technically. The way the new Deck.GL visualizations work is that they don't aggregate unless you specify a metric. \r\n\r\nI'm unclear on how to handle this original mapbox visualization in the light of the recent work we've been doing using Deck.GL. The new scatterplot viz is much better than this one, but it doesn't support the dynamic clustering use case (where clusters are created on the fly as users zoom in /out). We may want to refactor that visualization to be more like the new ones. First thing to do would be to use the `spatial` control for lat/long which works with proper Druid spatial dims.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/354914262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/354920485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4142#issuecomment-354920485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4142","id":354920485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDkyMDQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-03T01:35:46Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T01:35:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The migration you are missing somehow is `INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade ca69c70ec99b -> a9c47e2c1547, add impersonate_user to dbs`.
