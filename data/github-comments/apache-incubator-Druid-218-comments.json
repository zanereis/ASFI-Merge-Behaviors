The script could potentially copy just the Guava files we know we need and do minimal modifications to them in order to get them to be in different packages.\r\n\r\nI think it's probably a good idea. We have so many problems caused by the combination of the Guava team's historical attitude towards backwards compatibility and the reluctance of the Hadoop community to upgrade to a non-ancient version of Guava. Recently the Guava team has had a more pragmatic attitude towards backwards compatibility (they have promised to support non-Beta APIs indefinitely). But sadly, this doesn't help us much, given that we still need to be compatible with versions from the older era.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/458613792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/458616539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6088#issuecomment-458616539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6088","id":458616539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODYxNjUzOQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T16:50:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T16:50:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @gianm How would this look from an interface point of view?

Time-ordering scan results will cause events to not be nicely grouped by segment...for that reason, I don't think it makes sense to use that format.\r\n\r\nThe 3 options I've thought of:\r\n\r\n1) Having a separate output format for time-ordered scans -> An example of such a format would be a collection of events where segmentId is a field of each event.  This isn't great because Scan would have two output formats\r\n\r\n2) Returning a ScanResultValue for each event -> This is pretty bad because there would be a ridiculous amount of extra overhead from the list of columns.  \r\n\r\n3) Changing the output format for _all_ Scan queries -> I think this is a no-go because it would be a breaking change for existing clients\r\n\r\nAre there any better alternatives?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/459170520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/459171525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6923#issuecomment-459171525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6923","id":459171525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTE3MTUyNQ==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-31T00:53:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T01:09:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It also has a tooltip.

Or even keep taskDuration the same, but shorten the intermediateHandoffPeriod. This is because running with mixed segmentGranularities in the same datasource, while supported, can be a headache. Shortening the other two configs just means handoff happens more often.\r\n\r\n> Read in a few places that windowPeriod is not needed for KIS, if I change the segment duration to 5 min and an event

promotion can have unexpected results.\r\n> \r\n> For instance, the binary representation of the integer 640 is 0b0000_0010_1000_0000, which can also be written with the array of (unsigned) bytes [2, 128]. However, since Java uses two's complement, the representation of the integer in signed bytes will be [2, -128] (because the byte 0b1000_0000 is promoted to the int 0b1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1000_0000). Consequently, trying to reconstruct the initial integer by shifting and adding the values of the bytes without taking care of the sign will not produce the expected result.\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/NUM52-J.+Be+aware+of+numeric+promotion+behavior","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/459274669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
