storages by adding `JDBCStorageConfig`, if specific storage needs new configurations, they can extend `JDBCStorageConfig`, example like `MySQLShardingStorageConfig`.\r\n- Remove mounting config files in `test/e2e-v2/script/shardingsphere-proxy/base-compose.yml`, this is general base docker-compose.yaml and the config files should be mounted in where it's used, like when testing mysql we should mount mysql config files in the mysql case folder, and mount postgresql config files in postgresql folder.\r\n- Remove configuratioin `h2.driver: ${SW_STORAGE_H2_DRIVER:org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource}`, this is not needed as the driver name can be inferred from the URL `jdbc:h2`, also use the same `properties` configuration style as other JDBC storages
