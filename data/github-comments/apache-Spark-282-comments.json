The code in this case would just try to remove 10 from `stageIdToData` several times, which is a bit redundant but harmless.\n\nMy first comment was that, with this change, if I request 5 elements to be trimmed, it will actually trim nothing. The first 5 elements of `stages` are all 10, and none can be removed because 10 is active. I would more readily expect that the behavior is to remove up to 5 elements that can be removed. 11 and 18 can be removed in this case. If you filter out active, _then_ take, you get this behavior.\n\nThe second potential issue is that, with this change, the method will return [11,18] as `stages` after 5 values have been trimmed, even though 10 is still active. Is that OK?

Spark continues to depend on Guava in order to compile, and so that consumers of Spark also see this dependency in their builds.\n\n(You can see the discussion with @vanzin about whether to alter how downstream consumers of the Maven build see the Guava dependency -- `provided` vs `compile` vs `optional` -- but this doesn't affect the assembly, and only affects whether Guava automatically becomes a part of the downstream consumer's classpath. I still have a minor issue with `provided`, but unless @pwendell has any opinion on this, consider me outvoted.)\n\nSo I think the proposal was already to continue showing a dependency on Guava, but, to alter the assembly to include only `Optional`, and shaded copies of all else. And maybe to tweak the dependency to hide it by default for downstream consumers.\n\nInlining the shaded JARs is all but like removing use of Guava, as far as the world is concerned. That certainly takes it out of the picture. The little snag is Optional. It will now inevitably collide with any other app that builds Guava in too. And downstream consumers can't manage away the conflict normally. It may either be a harmless warning or cause a real problem if Optional changes later. In general I don't like pushing the shading into the compile-time world. Remember the `hive-exec` awfulness? This would not be my first choice, versus:\n\nI think your second paragraph is basically the same thing proposed already, with one difference. Yes, the build still continues to say it depends on Guava. The concrete assembly is put together differently. I think you _can_ use Guava's Optional rather than embedding a source copy of it and compiling that. Right @vanzin? with some shading cleverness?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51602338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51602933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1854#issuecomment-51602933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1854","id":51602933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjAyOTMz","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T13:49:15Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T13:49:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@YanTangZhai Ah good point.

You get what Curator happens to depend on. Core already depends on ZK indirectly.\n\nHowever, I see no reason that Spark cares about ZK per se. Vendors can control the ZK versions downstream if it maters. So it's probably less confusing to just remove `zookeeper.version` too. Right now it's overridden in the MapR profile, as if it does something, when it doesn't.\n\nThe explicit dependency in Kafka tests can directly specify a version of, say, 3.4.5 for its own purpose.

You're publishing your project's artifact to maven central, which just happens to include the shaded classes. This is similar to how assembly jars are published (http://search.maven.org/#browse|-1363484021).\n\n(EDIT: yes, they's only a pom for the assembly, but if the pom's packaging type is \"jar\", you get the jar there. Well, you get the point.)\n\n#### The Optional class\n\nIt should be possible to use Guava's original Optional, without having to fork it. The only reason I forked it is to allow changing the version of Guava without affecting the Spark API. But that can be done on-demand if needed. I'd still package it in the spark-core jar, otherwise the guava dependency would need to have \"compile\" scope (see below).\n\n#### Compile vs. Provided\n\nMy main argument for using \"provided\" is to avoid leaking guava into the user's _compilation classpath_. Users depend on spark-core (e.g.), and if spark-core has a compile dependency on guava, guava will be available in the user's compilation classpath (regadless of whether spark-core is set up as compile or provided). If that dependency is provided (and thus not transitive), then it never shows up; if the user needs guava, he needs to explicitly depend on it.\n\nThis does have effects on packaging, though: for people using an existing spark assembly to run their apps, nothing changes. But if the user is creating his own uber-jar with spark and everything else in it, and running it in some custom environment, he'll need to explicitly package guava (even if his app doesn't use it). My belief is that the former case is the overwhelming majority, and the latter case means the user has to care about too many things already (e.g. choosing compatible versions of everything between his app and spark and hadoop et al) for this little thing to be a real concern.\n\n#### Shading at compile time\n\n@srowen let me know if I misunderstood, but do you mean creating a spark-core jar with the shaded guava classes in it? I actually started with that alternative, but it seems messy. Either you have all downstream projects reference the shaded classes (something that would be needed if going with the separate shaded jar approach), or you get into a weird place, where spark-core is referencing the shaded classes but all downstream projects are not. The assembly would fix everything (by shading again), but someone not using the assembly could get really weird errors.\n\nAlso, having duplicate class names in the classpath really confuses some IDEs that automatically add imports. More manual configuration for people to add...\n\n#### sbt shading plugin\n\nI think the code I wrote can be added to the sbt-assembly plugin (with some modifications). It probably is the best place for that, anyway, since I created it as a merge strategy for that plugin. But that's for later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51633944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51634078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1852#issuecomment-51634078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1852","id":51634078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjM0MDc4","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T17:41:06Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T17:41:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would be helpful if you could include a few sentences on why you think this change should be made in the description of the PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51634078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51634494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1817#issuecomment-51634494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1817","id":51634494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjM0NDk0","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T17:44:18Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T17:44:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does it make sense to merge this?

about updating the documentation.\n\nI don't know if application jars take precedence when you use SparkSubmit. On the executor side I think JVMs  are always launched using `spark-class` which means that they should use `compute-classpath.sh` -- Also my guess is that since logging is initialized very early on, it might be too late if the application's log4j.properties is added to the class loader when doing `addJar` or something like that.\n\n@aarondav @pwendell could probably throw more light on

It's just icky for downstream consumers. I think the non-assembly artifacts should be the 'pristine' raw ingredients and assemblies can be crazy remixes.\n\nI can see the argument for provided. It has the pros and cons you mention. It's a moot point for people that use Spark as `provided`, which is what they're supposed to do. So, meh. Just drop a comment in the POM to explain the scope.\n\nI had understood that the goal was to alter the Spark assembly in some way, such that with some certain footwork in the Hive on Spark build, the Hive on Spark assembly would work with the Spark assembly as deployed on people's clusters. That's mostly about getting Guava out of the way.\n\nI don't think this entails making anyone depend on a shaded anything in Maven. I think that's avoidable and undesirable. So I think we are all basically agreeing on that? So to be clear, Spark continues to express a dependency on Guava in its POM. It must. The shading affects deployed assemblies.\n\nThe only delta with what @pwendell suggests seems to be shading in Guava's Optional rather than keeping a source copy. But that seems fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51647806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51647837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1848#issuecomment-51647837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1848","id":51647837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjQ3ODM3","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T19:36:34Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T19:36:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA
