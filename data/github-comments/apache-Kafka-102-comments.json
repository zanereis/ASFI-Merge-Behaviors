As you can see, this was a hefty bit of work, but fortunately most of the transformations are straightforward. The main thing to focus on is the implementation of `LogValidator`, which contains the offset assignment and record validation logic that was previously contained in `ByteBufferMessageSet`. I've been pretty careful to preserve the optimizations that were present previously (e.g. in-place assignment where possible), but don't take my word for it.\n\nOne quick note on naming. I've renamed the `Records` object and subclasses to `LogBuffer`. So `MemoryRecords` is now `MemoryLogBuffer`. The reason for this change was that it felt unintuitive for an instance of `Records` to be an `Iterable<LogEntry>`, with the `LogEntry` instances being the actual container for the records. A `LogBuffer` instead represents a range of the log and provides access to the log entries contained in it. That seemed more intuitive to me, but let me know if you agree or if you have other suggestions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/260852086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/260854848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2140#issuecomment-260854848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2140","id":260854848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDg1NDg0OA==","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-16T05:02:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T05:02:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Slightly related, slightly tangential: is there a specific reason why we put the new broker-specific java classes under clients/ ?\n\nI'm talking about stuff like:\nFileRecords\nLeaderAndIsrRequest / LeaderAndIsrResponse\nStopReplicaRequest / StopReplicaResponse\nUpdateMetadataRequest / UpdateMetadataResponse\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/260854848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/260856355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2140#issuecomment-260856355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2140","id":260856355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDg1NjM1NQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-16T05:15:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T06:18:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@onurkaraman Yeah, I've wondered a bit about that also.

That is, `MemoryRecords` includes the offset (and record size in the underlying buffer) for each record while `Record` does not. It all becomes clearer when one realises that `MemoryRecords` (renamed to `MemoryLogBuffer` in the PR) actually contains `LogEntry` instances, each being a pair of `offset` and `Record`.\n\nOne thing to think about is whether this fits with the other `Record` classes we have and whether that matters (maybe it doesn't).

What do you think?\n\nBy the way, we'll squash automatically when we merge, so don't worry about that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261048237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261052298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2137#issuecomment-261052298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2137","id":261052298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTA1MjI5OA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-16T19:50:46Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T19:50:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks reasonable to me overall. cc @hachikuji \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261052298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261052876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2110#issuecomment-261052876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2110","id":261052876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTA1Mjg3Ng==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-16T19:52:45Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T19:52:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good catch, we should also handle InterruptException.

According to these docs, the metrics are exposed at the instance level: \"The following metrics are available on producer/consumer/connector instances\". KafkaStreams does not expose the metrics registry though, and I don't believe it exposes the underlying Producer and Consumer. I think I may be able to accomplish this by passing in a custom client supplier to the KafkaStreams constructor, and polling the underlying Producer/Consumer metric registries. It would be nice to just have the metrics registry exposed though for the KafkaStreams instance, but hopefully this will get resolved in 0.10.2.0 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3701).\n\nAnyways, I'm going to try passing in a custom client supplier (may just extend `DefaultKafkaClientSupplier` and see where that gets me), and may try extracting the metric values from the ProcessorContext (mentioned in the JIRA), but I'll post an answer to the SO post if I find a solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261235768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261349793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1836#issuecomment-261349793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1836","id":261349793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTM0OTc5Mw==","user":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T19:48:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T19:48:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma @junrao Thank you for the reviews.
