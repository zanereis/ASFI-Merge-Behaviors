@morningman I have considered this case.  Before colocate tables balancing, the backendsPerBucketSeq will update firstly and the backendsPerBucketSeq updating is fast. After backendsPerBucketSeq udpated, the new child table could use the new backendsPerBucketSeq, and when backendsPerBucketSeq is updating, the `createTablets` for creating new child table will block.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/430885921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/430886156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/245#issuecomment-430886156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/245","id":430886156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDg4NjE1Ng==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T06:06:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T06:06:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your job.\r\n\r\nI have some question.\r\n\r\nI think there is no need to  add \"colocate_with\" property when create parent table.
