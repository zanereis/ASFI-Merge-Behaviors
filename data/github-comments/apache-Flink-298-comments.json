Sorry for late reply, I did not get this PR's notification in my email until I check my Github's home page today.\r\n\r\nWhen introducing LZ4, I found current enum and configure through `ExecutionConfig` design have to introduce `snappy-java` and `LZ4-java` dependency into `flink-core`, which is actually not what I want. I prefer they just stay in `flink-runtime` module. I quite agree with your suggestion, and the only concern is that I might have to add `setStreamCompressionDecorator` both in `RocksDBStateBackend` and `AbstractFileStateBackend`.

I think overall the PR is almost complete, except for one case from our discussion that is not covered yet. With the PR, the user can configure the `ConfigurableOptionsFactory` with the flink-conf and the user can also set a completely different OptionsFactory in the code with `setOptions(...)`. However, the missing case is that the user is not yet able to configure a different `OptionsFactory` in the flink-conf, e.g. providing a class name that is then loaded. This would complete the set of configuration options. I have marked the part of the code where the change should be.

We set Flow control parameters, so that the API server knows how many messages we want to receive.\r\n2. We launch a async listener, which gets messages pushed from the API server (according to our flow control)\r\n3. The async listener forwards messages to a queue\r\n4. The Source is removing messages from the queue in its while() loop\r\n\r\nI propose to change the implementation to the following:\r\n1. We use the Synchronous Pull API: https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/pull#synchronous-pull \r\n2. The Source while() loop is pull-ing data from the API server\r\n\r\nBackpressure will be treated very naturally. \r\nFlink's `sourceContext.collect()` will not return if there's backpressure, thus we won't pull any new data from the API server (other parallel sources can pick up the data).\r\nUsers don't need to manually configure a good set of checkpointing / flow control config parameters.\r\nThe memory footprint is lower, as we don't have data in a in-memory queue. Similarly, this queue is adding latency, as records are waiting there.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/464740372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/464741634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7742#issuecomment-464741634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7742","id":464741634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDc0MTYzNA==","user":{"login":"leesf","id":10128888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTI4ODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10128888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf","html_url":"https://github.com/leesf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-18T14:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T14:00:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @zentol @dawidwys @GJL ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/464741634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/464742467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7716#issuecomment-464742467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7716","id":464742467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDc0MjQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-18T14:03:20Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T14:03:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @StefanRRichter.
