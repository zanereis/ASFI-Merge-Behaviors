Before the split, sending the active ack (including the result) was delayed until the action container logs have been processed - in general, until all processing has been completed on the action container that prevents a immediate warm re-use of the container.\r\n\r\nThe split into result and completion ack server following purposes:\r\n1. the result ack is sent once the activation result is available. When the controller receives the result ack, it can schedule the next action in a sequence or respond to blocking activations.\r\n2. the completion ack is sent once all action container processing has been completed and the container is ready again for warm re-use (or removal). When the controller receives the completion ack, it adjusts the free memory capacity of its shard on the invoker that sent the completion ack.\r\n\r\nWith the change you proposed / discussed above, you would speed up processing here?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/b0d48c87816f2e7c04ad9b9f9b4844a6e064047f/core/controller/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/controller/actions/PrimitiveActions.scala#L581-L594\r\n\r\nMy conclusion from a quick check is that we omit sending a result ack and only send the completion ack in error situations. Unfortunately, these are not only system errors but application and developer errors as well.

Resolving the promise with the former will return an action response such as \"request did not finish processing in time\" which isn't accurate.\r\n\r\n- For all 4 completions in question, the activation result is already present - because it's constructed immediately before sending the completion message. If it is carried in the message that's already sent, it would allow the controller to handle both the completion message and resolve the activation promise. This preserves the intended semantics when the active ack was split into two messages.\r\n\r\n- Note that in the absence of the active ack, if the secondary lookup mechanism is enabled, you get the constructed activation from its corresponding store so the bug manifests as a performance bug (waiting 10s of seconds for a result that should have been received sooner).\r\n\r\nThe split was incomplete and omits active acks for the error cases. We should either send two messages for the 4 out of the 5 cases (Completion and Active Ack), or combine both and send one message as I'm proposing for these cases since there is no additional waiting necessary as in the case where the result is ready but the resource not yet available to be reclaimed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/529425611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/529426536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4503#issuecomment-529426536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4503","id":529426536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTQyNjUzNg==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T11:26:21Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T11:26:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@duynguyen

to the list of pre-defined kinds and call `generateFallbackActivation()` with `Parameters(WhiskActivation.kindAnnotation, JsString(Exec.UNKNOWN))`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/d4d7ceb627573670f70993d4e31dcf2a6737c3f8/common/scala/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/entity/Exec.scala#L239-L243","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/529460436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/529563993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4564#issuecomment-529563993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4564","id":529563993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTU2Mzk5Mw==","user":{"login":"steffenrost","id":27352803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzUyODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27352803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost","html_url":"https://github.com/steffenrost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steffenrost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T16:38:40Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T16:38:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

So what about adding the action kind to the ActivationMessage when creating it?\r\n\r\nI think the current change is fine as is. In the two cases affected by the change in InvokerReactive. The first case: `get` failed in the second: `namespace` is blacklisted.\r\n\r\nWhat you're suggesting involves sending more information over the message bus. It's OK to do that but there is a cost to continuing to grown the activation message. Is it important enough to extend the ActivationMessage (serialization and deserialization costs) to cover two corner cases?\r\n\r\nI don't think there have been any recent plots to show performance costs to cross the message bus as a function of activation message - I'm curious to see those costs, since it's easy to add fields without knowing that the drawbacks might be. We've already done that several times without careful considerations iirc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/530438270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/530631327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4617#issuecomment-530631327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4617","id":530631327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDYzMTMyNw==","user":{"login":"jiangpengcheng","id":1858477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T01:51:07Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T01:51:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sven-lange-last Never mind, it's totally fine\r\n\r\nI also agree with @rabbah that add an extra field to `ActivationMessage` may introduce some costs which are not proportional to the gain","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/530631327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/530799929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4573#issuecomment-530799929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4573","id":530799929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDc5OTkyOQ==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T12:21:44Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T12:21:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think we should merge this automation.

Enable full-text search of activation(including logs)\r\n2. Better scalability\r\n3. Easy to manipulate data especially in terms of deleting old(unused) data with the index alias.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, @dubee had worked on `ElasticSearchActivaitonStore` some time back, but it was not completed for some reasons.\r\nI suspect there may be some historical reason to tie up with CouchDB?\r\n\r\nIf there is no other historical reason to persist CouchDB, I would like to bring up the `ElasticSearchActivationStore` again and we are willing to contribute it as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/532092188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/532154575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4627#issuecomment-532154575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4627","id":532154575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjE1NDU3NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-17T10:06:37Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T08:04:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

A concept that fully removes activation documents from CouchDB after a retention period is complex and consumes a lot of CPU on the database cluster. In addition, a large amount of activation documents consumes a lot of space. As a consequence, storing activations can get pretty expensive if you run a large-scale production environment.\r\n\r\nWhen going forward with the proposal of not storing activations for blocking + successful + \"not timed out on the front-end\" invocations, we need to check with clients whether their existing workloads break with such a change. Migration and evolution of the system is always the challenge of running a public production environment.\r\n\r\nWe had in mind to introduce a kind of activation store throttling - for example, only store a limited amount of activations per minute. This gives you a nice developer experience when starting with Openwhisk and for trying things out. But when running large production workloads, the workload owner would have to take care of storing action results - it's no more done by the platform.\r\n\r\nYour proposal with not storing blocking + successful + \"not timed out\" invocations has the big advantage that you will either receive activation results as result of your blocking activation or by explicitly asking for activation results. With activation store throttling, there are situations where the platform does not give you the activation result at all.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `ElasticSearchActivationStore` - we recently moved from an ELK based logging stack to LogDNA which bases on a different technology. That's why the `ElasticSearchActivationStore` is no more in focus for us. At the moment, we are storing activations to our databases as well as forwarding them to the client's LogDNA logging space.\r\n\r\nI think there are two valid strategies in this area: reducing the amount of activations as well as using better options for storing activations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/532203874/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/532206912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4627#issuecomment-532206912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4627","id":532206912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjIwNjkxMg==","user":{"login":"sven-lange-last","id":17647888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjQ3ODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17647888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last","html_url":"https://github.com/sven-lange-last","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven-lange-last/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-17T12:52:53Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T12:52:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dgrove-oss thanks a lot for reviewing and providing clarifications / improvements.

Since it was disabled by default, no one tried to use it. We had to urge heavy users to use the flag.\r\nSince the main problem is the scalability of the system, users are supposed not to consider the system issue.\r\nThey always wanted to see their results no matter of the environment(dev/production).\r\nEven though we enable the feature by default, we can not stop users disabling the flag(store activations) all the time.\r\n\r\nWe stored failed activations even though the flag is enabled for better debugging, but anyway users wanted to see their successful activation results sometimes. Not only the activation results but they also wanted to see metadata such as `initTime`, `waitTime`, etc. (I think if we want to reduce the size of activaitons, it could be one option to store metadata and just skip results.)\r\n\r\nSo we dropped `volatile` flag, stopped using `CouchDbActivationStore` and introduced `ElasticSearchActivationStore`.\r\n\r\nRegarding reducing the number of activations, I think there are also two aspects.\r\n1. Reducing the number of activations/second\r\n2. Reducing the number of stored activations.\r\n\r\nWith CouchDB, we observed issues in both cases.\r\n(Even with 10GB data, CouchDB sometimes started dragging.)\r\n\r\nRegarding number 1, I think even though we reduce the amount, there would be a limitation as the size of cluster grows. We anyway need to handle(store) some portion of activations and if the cluster scales, anyway this portion would be beyond the CouchDB can handle. I still agree that this would be a good option no matter which datastores are used, but anyway we need to secure some level of scalability at some point.\r\n\r\nRegarding number 2, most of the users query relatively recent activations.\r\nThey tend to query activations within 1 month ~ 3 months.\r\nIt would not be cost-effective to store all activation data during 1 year ~ 2 years.\r\nSo we decided to keep relatively \"recent\", but \"all\" activations.\r\n(I think many other OW operators already took a similar approach.)\r\n\r\nSo I think our datastore should have enough scalability to handle some level of requests/s and it should have the ability to take care of \"cold\" data which is rarely accessed.\r\nElasticSearch is a great option for this.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to log collection, I have been curious whether there \"is\" a case where one function generates 10MB logs. I am not sure it is realistic. As the granularity level of invocation is small in the serverless world, I think the size of the logs should be small as well. \r\n\r\nCurrently, logs are collected asynchronously aside from activation storing even though logs are also included in activation data. I think this is because the log size can be up to 10MB. \r\nIf we can limit the size of the maximum logs to relatively small one such as 1 MB or 512KB,(I think this is also quite big enough) we can just store logs with activations with one request.\r\n\r\nStoring logs with ELK is great but if we store them along with activations in ElasticSearch, it would give another value to users. Users can query data using logs in conjunction with metadata.\r\n(e.g: They might want to see logs whose `waitTime` is bigger than 1s.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/532503097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/532582932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4627#issuecomment-532582932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4627","id":532582932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjU4MjkzMg==","user":{"login":"falkzoll","id":20904021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTA0MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20904021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll","html_url":"https://github.com/falkzoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falkzoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T08:37:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T08:37:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 to document how to remove an existing runtime/kind in a controlled way from an already running openwhisk makes a lot of sense.
