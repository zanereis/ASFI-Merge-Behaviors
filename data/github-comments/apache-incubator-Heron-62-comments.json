However, in the use case you mentioned, the tag/category seems like external to heron and a topology. It is also possibly that a user would like to update topology's tag without restarting the topology. I can also imagine that the tag will be assigned by an operator who may not have the ability to update topology code. Hence, I think making the tag a `Config` may not address the requirement. \r\n\r\n@kramasamy ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/376988665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/377016133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2815#issuecomment-377016133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2815","id":377016133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzAxNjEzMw==","user":{"login":"cckellogg","id":240473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg","html_url":"https://github.com/cckellogg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cckellogg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T19:58:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T19:58:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ashvina any suggestions how to implement this feature?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/377016133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/377035623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2815#issuecomment-377035623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2815","id":377035623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzAzNTYyMw==","user":{"login":"ashvina","id":10034060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM0MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10034060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina","html_url":"https://github.com/ashvina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T21:03:03Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T21:03:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since this is a UI/explorer feature and no other heron component will ever use this data, how about adding an UI action/command to \"decorate\" topology with labels?

I believe openssl tries to be as backwards compatible as possible (https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/timeline/openssl/). 1.1.0 was released in 2016 which was the largest breaking change they've made and until then its been close to 100%. I think anyone running a version older than 1.1.0 will have bigger problems then not being able to run heron with ssl but assuming the methods that we're using are still in that version it *should* just work. \r\n\r\nI am working on getting this change into our production environment now so i will hopefully have some metrics to share with you soon regarding any performance impact, etc. I have tested this out extensively locally and confirmed that the data is transferred over ssl when a certificate key and path are supplied through
