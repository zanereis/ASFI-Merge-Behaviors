I believe that the root of the issue is that the t-digest takes the compression factor more seriously now than it did before. That means that there will typically be 27 ± 5 centroids in a digest with compression factor 50. In the failure that I analyzed, there were 42 data points across 23 centroids. The issue observed has several contributory factors:\r\n\r\na) the requirement that values differ by no more than 5 percent is very optimistic when one digest interpolates and the other doesn't. This will happen differently according to just which points get collected together and can easily differ, particularly right on the border between centroids of weight 1 and 2. It should be noted that substantially over 1% of all consecutive samples of groups of 40 uniformly distributed variates will be separated by more than 10% which means that interpolation is very likely to cause this error.\r\nb) the interpretation of compression parameter for 3.3 is more strict resulting in somewhat smaller digest than before.\r\nc) the compression value for the t-digest is smaller than typical (50 instead of 100 or 200).\r\nd) the quantile chosen interacted with the number of samples to force interpolation to almost as bad a result as possible.\r\n\r\nThe summary of this is that the t-digest appears to be functioning correctly and this test is a bit too aggressive. The likely best remedy is to increase the compression value used to 100. Increasing default compression for t-digests across the board should be considered as well.\r\n\r\n## Detailed analysis\r\nThe general situation is as shown in this figure:\r\n![Figure showing interpolation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdunning/t-digest/59fe45cd80b16b0082e50eddfce77e60daee1841/docs/interpolation-figure.png)\r\n\r\nThe code necessary to regenerate the figure can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tdunning/a10d79bc4cb3834cf2ecea96e70cb9f7#file-figure-r).\r\n\r\nThe dark line with small circles represents the exact empirical CDF as determined by the actual data. With the t-digest, we use the mid-point rule so the CDF at a value exactly equal to a sample is half-way between the values to the left and right of the sample. In this example, t-digest A merged the samples at 1530 and 1940 into a centroid at 1735 and the samples at 2166 and 2168 into a centroid at 2167. This causes interpolation when the value of quantile(0.12) is computed and the resulting value of 923.8 is shown by the left-most circled X. The correct value of the empirical distribution for this quantile is 1530. The interpolated value is far from this correct value because the quantile desired is so close to the transition from one sample to the next.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, t-digest B starts merging values slightly above this point so sample 1530 is still alone in a centroid. This means that digest B computes the precisely correct value of 1530 (represented by the right-most circled X). The threshold for the test is 5% of 10,000, however, so the test fails because the difference is 606.2.  The fact that these samples have such a large difference is a major contributor here; if this difference were less than 500, the interpolation could not cause this error. It is the combination of the bad luck of the large difference right at the transition to multi-sample centroids that causes this problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/863828785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/864158645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7069#issuecomment-864158645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7069","id":864158645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDE1ODY0NQ==","user":{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-18T16:42:03Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T16:42:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tdunning for the detailed analysis, much appreciated.\r\n\r\n@Jackie-Jiang could you revisit the test with suggestions from Ted?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/864158645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/864235351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7069#issuecomment-864235351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7069","id":864235351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDIzNTM1MQ==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-18T19:32:06Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T19:32:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tdunning Thanks for the explanation.\r\nIt there a formula to calculate the max error rate from the compression factor (or reversed) so that I can modify the test accordingly?

Errors in the sample space are notionally unbounded because the sample distribution can be stretched. In addition, t-digest is normally used when estimating tails of a distribution so the relative error `error(q) / max(q, 1-q)` is controlled rather than the absolute error. The result is that error near the median can be orders of magnitude larger than near the extremes.\r\n\r\nFor uniform distribution, errors in sample space are the same as errors in quantile (subject to scaling by the range).\r\n\r\nRegarding error scaling with respect to $q$, the figure below shows that for small values of `delta` errors scale roughly with `1/delta^2` and then transitions to scaling roughly with `1/sqrt(delta)` ([see this article on t-digest](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665963820300403) for more detailed information). The problem with this statement is that it doesn't really respond to your question because it is, again, focused on extreme `q`.\r\n\r\n![Scaling of error with compression factor delta](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/main/docs/error-vs-compression.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nErrors near the median for well-behaved distributions like the uniform distribution should be roughly like `2/delta` given that there should be about `delta/2` centroids (delta here is often called compression in the t-digest code). The actual results will be somewhat better than this to the extent that interpolation works. Here is a figure that shows max error of quantile(x) for selected values of x at various combinations of delta and number of samples. Note that these errors are relative to the exact empirical quantiles. Errors in consistency between different t-digests could, conceivably, be double these numbers. Also, if you looked at a high resolution scan of possible values of x, you would likely find bad cases right at the transition between 1 and 2 samples per centroid. \r\n\r\n![Errors as a function of delta and number of samples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdunning/t-digest/main/docs/max-error-uniform.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, `delta=100` has *lots* fewer outlier cases and is likely to be what you need. I note that this is the default value for most of your code. This particular test stands out a bit for using `delta = 50`.\r\n\r\nThis last figure is generated from the file `median-error.csv` produced by the `com.tdunning.tdigest.quality.CompareKllTest#testMedianErrorVersusScale` test in the main branch of t-digest. The code to produce the [figure can be found in this gist](https://gist.github.com/tdunning/78a4a8ee17b48d35cd7ec496b2f0d817).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/864294396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/864313697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7073#issuecomment-864313697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7073","id":864313697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDMxMzY5Nw==","user":{"login":"dongxiaoman","id":11821736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIxNzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11821736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman","html_url":"https://github.com/dongxiaoman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-18T23:11:45Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T23:11:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"testing branch now working.

I can see that 200,000 random numbers are generated and put pair-by-pair into t-digests that are somehow serialized and combined. Ultimately, the data seems to be grouped using two fields each with 100 values resulting in a total 10,000 digests each with an average of 20 data points in them. Beyond this outline, my understanding fades to nothing. Can you say what the different between the star-index path and non-star-index path is?\r\n\r\nWithout understanding the details, I think that it is a reasonable assumption to say that the difference between two digests with the same data but constructed differently will be limited by the difference between difference between either digest and the actual empirical distribution. The test, as designed, does not appear to be likely to put more than 45 data points in a single digest which means that any compression parameter greater than 100 will result in zero error because all 45 data points will be preserved.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the underlying intent of the test is a bit different from the execution, though, and you are interested in two things over a range of digest sizes:\r\n\r\n- that the star tree approach will not increase errors relative to the non star tree approach\r\n\r\n- that the t-digest will not introduce large errors in the first place for some definition of large\r\n\r\nI can say that pretty much all quantiles such that q <= 0.1 or q >= 0.9 will have really small errors with compression of 200 for as many samples as you might expect and still quite small errors with compression of 100. \r\n\r\nHere are some examples derived from 50 runs for different values of compression (delta). In general, the worst case is when there is a transition to two samples per centroid. Other than this, the accuracy for the median is generally worse than the accuracy for the tails (that is, of course, the point of the t-digest).\r\n\r\nIn general, for 100 samples or more, you can occasionally have errors of more than 2% with delta=50, and will rarely have errors over 1% with delta=100 or delta=200. I don't have handy data for n < 100, for delta=200, there should never be any errors for such small counts except possibly right at the median.\r\n\r\n![delta=50](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdunning/t-digest/main/docs/error-uniform-delta%3D50.png)\r\n\r\n![delta=100](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdunning/t-digest/main/docs/error-uniform-delta%3D100.png)\r\n\r\n![delta=200](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdunning/t-digest/main/docs/error-uniform-delta%3D200.png)\r\n\r\n![delta=500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdunning/t-digest/main/docs/error-uniform-delta%3D500.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/864807282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/865202990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7077#issuecomment-865202990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7077","id":865202990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTIwMjk5MA==","user":{"login":"MrNeocore","id":22521284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTIxMjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22521284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore","html_url":"https://github.com/MrNeocore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrNeocore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-21T17:09:27Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T17:09:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This behavior is due to the fact that `pinot.server.instance.reload.consumingSegment` was off (`false`)\r\nThe following PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/7078/files updated this default behavior :+1: \r\n\r\nClosing !\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/865202990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/865223114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7076#issuecomment-865223114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7076","id":865223114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTIyMzExNA==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-21T17:41:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T17:41:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tdunning Thanks for the explanation.\r\nYes we randomly generate 100,000 t-digest objects, each constructed from 2 random integers of range [0, 10,000).

@mcvsubbu \r\n\r\n> @kkrugler the call to remove aged deleted segments, is invoked from retention manager. If you never ever delete anything from any table in your cluster, you can (for now) disable RetentionManager. Alternatively, create a test table with a segment and delete it so that the parent dir is created on deletion. This will avoid your warnings and alerts.\r\n\r\nYes, I've manually created the directory, so the warnings and alerts are gone.\r\n\r\n> It seems to be that HadoopPinotFS is miscoded. The method isDirectory() is a boolean, and if it does not exist or is not a directory, it should return false. IMO the fix is in the underlying FS implementation.\r\n\r\nAgreed, as that would be more consistent with how Java's `File.isDirectory()` works. I've filed a [separate issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/7083) for that.\r\n\r\nThough even if this method worked as expected, and returned false, we'd get a warning in the logs every 5 minutes or so.\r\n\r\nWhich is why I agree with @Jackie-Jiang that we should try to auto-create the directory, as then the warning is for a real problem (something went wrong with the creation, or it was accidentally deleted).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/867175051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/867230360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7082#issuecomment-867230360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7082","id":867230360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzIzMDM2MA==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T23:51:32Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T23:51:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kkrugler you are right.

The segment format in Pinot is optimized to assist the query execution engine of Pinot. If the proposal is to bypass the query execution entirely, what value does the format itself provide to other engines? In other words, why would running Presto/Spark on the pinot format be better than running on ORC/Parquet?
