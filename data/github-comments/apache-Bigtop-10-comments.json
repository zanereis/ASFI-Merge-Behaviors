Then different ruby defines different versions of mintar. We need to adjust minitar version in logstash config corresponding to ruby. And there are many other packages that needs to be adjusted. \r\nIMHO, it's better to use the packages which logstash originally required and it's also efficient to use a ruby-2.4.0 to build logstash which was verifyied in almost all Distros and platforms.  Hope you will understand the reason of it, thanks again.\r\n\r\nThere are still some smoke tests issues in Arm64 about `flush_interval => 0`.

Thus BigtopMpack is expected to be a seperate component along with Ambari itself.\r\n3. BigtopMpack has compatibility issue across difference Ambari versions. It is expected to work on the same major version like 2.6.x.\r\n\r\nIf that understanding is correct, I agree with @mattAndruff to have BigtopMpack source split out from Ambari patch, then user can easily modify/build this and make contribution to it like bugfix and adding more services (so far I see BigtopMpack-1.0 supports zookeeper/hdfs/mapreduce only). Maybe to sit as a standalone component, say `bigtop-packages/src/common/bigtop-mpack`? We can also release rpm/deb packages which contains bgtp-ambari-mpack-x.x.x.x.tar.gz that end user can easily get and installed.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/635228180/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/635244965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/620#issuecomment-635244965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/620","id":635244965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTI0NDk2NQ==","user":{"login":"guyuqi","id":20575685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTc1Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20575685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi","html_url":"https://github.com/guyuqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T10:02:08Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T10:02:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@evans-ye Agree with your point that the basic packages should be installed in Bigtop_toolchain.\r\nI 'd like to put `gnupg2` into Bigtop_toolchain not in `do-component-build`.
