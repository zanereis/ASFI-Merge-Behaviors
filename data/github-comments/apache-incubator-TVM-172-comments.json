That's the intention of the `plevel` in strategy. If this schedule has a potential correctness issue, we could have the following 3 solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Suggest users enabling correctness checking when tuning (i.e., let AutoTVM check correctness for each schedule config), but this will also check the other task that does not have this issue, making the tuning time even longer.\r\n\r\n2. Add an optional when registering an AutoTVM task to enforce correctness checking, but this requires a change to not only the registration but AutoTVM mechanism.\r\n\r\n3. Comment out the schedule and let it back after the issue has been resolved. The problem is that we may never let it back if no one is dedicated to fix it...\r\n\r\n@icemelon9 do you have any suggestions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/603961524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/603995475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5131#issuecomment-603995475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5131","id":603995475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzk5NTQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"selo1412","id":62495665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk1NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62495665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412","html_url":"https://github.com/selo1412","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selo1412/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-25T18:02:00Z","updated_at":"2020-03-25T18:02:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@comaniac @icemelon9 \r\nI took \r\ntvm/tests/python/relay/test_pass_fast_math.py\r\ntvm/topi/tests/python/test_topi_math.py\r\nas reference to add unit test \r\ntvm/tests/python/relay/test_op_fast_math.py .\r\nand I found some error in topi/tests/python/ make the commit 5 cannot be built.\r\n\r\nIs there any suggestions for the above situation?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/603995475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/603999626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5148#issuecomment-603999626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5148","id":603999626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzk5OTYyNg==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-25T18:09:39Z","updated_at":"2020-03-25T18:09:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, let's comment out this implementation temporarily.

However I couldn't not agree completely on the reasonings shared by masahi. \r\n\r\nPlease find my response accordingly. \r\n\r\nI know the current support of ONNX, but is that not the case for many of the frontends already supported now?\r\n\r\nAlso if the CI slowness is the worry, then we should come up with a solution for that. We should not restrict to fewer frontends. \r\n\r\nAs I see, the numerous user of chainer framework will get benefitted by this frontends, even though they are encouraged to switch to other framework.\r\n\r\nAs the concern raised for development and maintenance, definitely I will take care of that through constant effort. Also one point, the maintenance effort is proportional to no of active user(as the requirement also increases with that).\r\n\r\nMy opinion is this frontend will attract more user towards TVM as it opens more space for experiments. Also it shows the strength of express abilities of TVM. \r\nBut having said that, I would not mind dropping this feature, if TVM members thinks it is unreasonable to add this frontends. Thanks!
