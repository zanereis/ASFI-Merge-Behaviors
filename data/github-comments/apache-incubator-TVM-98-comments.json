for your comments and open mind.\r\n\r\nMy approach to this PR is from a user of NNVM API coming from its usage in MXNet. I don't want to create an unnecessary object. I looked at this method and it should be static as it doesn't use any member variables to function, this for me is a basic rule of thumb of software engineering, that's pretty much all there is to this PR intention.\\\r\n\r\nIt avoids the creation of this additional object that is not needed. The gradient function is operating on Node and NodePtr, NodeEntry etc as you are well aware. So from a user perspective yes I would like this merged or factored out of this class if you think there's a better place to put this kind of functions, please make a suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf your request is that I also make ListInputNames or any other similar function static for consistency I'm fine with adding some additional work to keep everything consistent, as I think this would be a fair request.\r\n\r\nRegarding discussion, what I was alluding to is a more general and extended discussion about improving the nnvm graph semantics, for example the graph and nodes could be more generic and have attributes as template arguments (think of NodeAttributes). This would be better than we currently have, for example autograd is shoved into the \"info\" field which is of type \"any\", you end up losing type information. This is beyond the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how we should move forward, I obviously would like this PR to be merged otherwise I wouldn't have opened it. I'm open to have additional refactorings requested. If it's not merged I will create a symbol as before but I would prefer to avoid that, for me is just a small ramification of a larger refactor.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/488485974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/488507864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3108#issuecomment-488507864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3108","id":488507864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODUwNzg2NA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-02T00:04:52Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T00:08:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK let me try again to summarize the discussions here. I think the API style really has things to do with a different perspective of what defines the graph. \r\n\r\n- The original API's view says that the Symbol object itself defines the graph, and whenever you wanted to create ListInputs, create a temporary Symbol object to do so.\r\n- Your current view says that Graph itself should not be bound to Symbol, and vector<NodeEntry> should be sufficient to define a graph, and thus you want to add the static function.\r\n\r\nBoth ways are valid engineering points. I personally know very well when should use static method vs member functions. However, even given my pedantic view about the code and infra, I do believe this is a case that could have gone either way. \r\n\r\nOnly changing one API ListInputNodes, represent a breach of the consistency of the design -- because of parts of the API goes into one style while rest remains in another.\r\n\r\nGiven that the historical design has already made an opinionated view about what a symbolic graph should be, I would prefer to keep the API as it is. Creating a temporary object is fine, as one-liner and wouldn't breach anything in the code and it keeps the view of API consistent with the original design. It won't be a critical blocker for your changes.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand sometimes different developer has different points of views and I fully understand potential frustration you might have given your take of design(which was apparently quite clear). Please think a bit more again about the technical points here and see if it the other side of the argument also makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf I would have to make a recommendation.

I am specifically referring to the ListXYZ API in the Symbol, as all of them now are member functions and treat general List Input manipulation as a special operation to the data structure defined by the symbol.\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise, the additional copy won't become the bottleneck of your code given that there are already many vector and additional data structure created during PostOrder Visit. And creating the symbol will just be fine. The reason for doing so is to respect the original semantics of ListXYZ as they are bound to the Symbol. \r\n\r\nI think at the moment all the argument has been presented. I have read your refactored code(fully understand what you want and your arguments),  and have presented my recommendation :) This is certainly not perfect,  as everything is part of the tradeoff in software. Just like there are also additional trade-offs you make by using template vs type-erased any (which we could discuss once you brought up the RFC).\r\n\r\nI do hope that you can also take a look at the discussion thread and consider it for a while.

for the PR. One thing I want to note is that we want to focus on the good use-cases in index simplification. \r\n\r\n- Think about specific index simplification applications\r\n- Collectively use rewrite/canonical simplifier\r\n\r\nFor example, it is a bit unclear whether taking the gcd out from ```x * c1 + y * c2``` is helpful in a particular case(the canonical does it in another way). Similarly, most of the divisions we encounter in index simplification will rarely have a negative value in the right operand.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate about the second principle, given that canonical simplifier now inheritates rewrite simplifier, we might be able to use canonical for many cases that rewrite simplifier is not good at.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we can provide some justifications for the set of changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/490530732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/490531462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3119#issuecomment-490531462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3119","id":490531462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDUzMTQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T15:24:03Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T15:24:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@srkreddy1238

I'm currently trying to move my implementation of tensor expression autodiff to the new simplifiers instead of the obsolete Halide simplifier. Most of these changes are required for simplifying complex automatically generated expressions involving divisions. Most of the new rules are just slightly modified copies of the existing rules, just to cover more cases.\r\n\r\n> For example, it is a bit unclear whether taking the gcd out from `x * c1 + y * c2` is helpful in a particular case(the canonical does it in another way).\r\n\r\nIt is needed to simplify expressions like `2 * x + 4 * y <= 0`. I think I can move it to the LT case.\r\n\r\n> Similarly, most of the divisions we encounter in index simplification will rarely have a negative value in the right operand.\r\n\r\nI can remove the corresponding test cases and the rules specifically designed to cover the negative divisor case, since they are not really required by the autodiff. However I would keep them just in case.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> To elaborate about the second principle, given that canonical simplifier now inheritates rewrite simplifier, we might be able to use canonical for many cases that rewrite simplifier is not good at.\r\n\r\nThe rewrite simplifier has a clear design, so I would prefer fixing the rewrite simplifier rather than the canonical simplifier.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently there are CI errors which seem to be connected to the fact that the old Halide notion of division is still in use in some parts of TVM. I didn't expect it and have to think what to do with them.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/490568215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/490568632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3144#issuecomment-490568632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3144","id":490568632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDU2ODYzMg==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T17:03:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T17:03:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jroesch Sure.
