PR has significant memory pressure changes in the reducer and changes the default behavior.\n\nWith this PR the JVM now holds onto 2 incremental index objects and the persist objects at the same time (instead of 1 incremental index object and the persist objects). This is a notable increase in memory pressure and should not be enabled by default.\n\nTo get around such constraints, the executor service can default to the sameThreadExecutorService and use a blocking service with a set backpressure size as an option.\n\nSuch an option could be represented by \"io.druid.index.persist.background.count\" or similar, which defaults to 0. In the case of 0 the sameThreadExecutorService can be used, in the case of > 0 the executor service with a blocking queue could have its capacity set to the config value. In the case of < 0 is an error.\n\nThere are use cases where this can be very handy, but this PR needs some major JVM heap pressure benchmarks before such behavior can be turned on by default. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166940279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166941459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2146#issuecomment-166941459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2146","id":166941459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Njk0MTQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"navis","id":809395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/809395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis","html_url":"https://github.com/navis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-23T16:46:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-23T16:46:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks like same with #2140\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166941459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166942040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2133#issuecomment-166942040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2133","id":166942040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Njk0MjA0MA==","user":{"login":"navis","id":809395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/809395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis","html_url":"https://github.com/navis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-23T16:48:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-23T16:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"met #2128. running test again \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166942040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166947481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2152#issuecomment-166947481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2152","id":166947481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Njk0NzQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-23T17:15:11Z","updated_at":"2015-12-23T17:15:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This does 2 things.\n1.

I'm gonna try forking your branch and editing it up some to see if I'm smoking crack or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/167005294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/167011604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2153#issuecomment-167011604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2153","id":167011604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzAxMTYwNA==","user":{"login":"navis","id":809395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/809395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis","html_url":"https://github.com/navis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T00:04:41Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T00:04:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Passed once. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/167011604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/167012769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2155#issuecomment-167012769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2155","id":167012769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzAxMjc2OQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T00:19:40Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T00:19:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\nTests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 18.223 sec <<< FAILURE!

IndexMergerV9, changed some low level interfaces but totally compatible with the old way.\n_IndexMergerV9 has not been tested, just make the whole thing compiled and old tests passed_ \n\nSome explanation and thoughts here: \n1. Changes to ColumnPartSerde's interface is to separate the Serializer and Deserializer. So we can have multiple serializers, one of it has the same behavior with old ones. And another one is the new streaming version.\n2. All writers(time, dim, metrics) are backed by tmp files and copy to the final smoosh file directly.\n3. GenericColumnSerializer and its sub-classes are almost identical to MetricColumnSerializer, except the GenericColumnSerializer can write to a Channel(which is allocated from smoosher when building). The MetricColumnSerializer are used for build v8 index, and can be removed later.\n4. IndexedIntsWriter are responsible for writing dimension ids which now has 4 types of the formats, more details are here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-development/0CxhljSGeeo\n\nAnd here are some points I think should be discussed with your guys when writing the codes:\n~~1. about skippedDimensions in IndexMaker: dimensions with cardinality 0 are treated as skipped dimensions. But in current version of IncrementalIndex, even null dim value are converted to empty string and treated as a valid value, so I assume all the dimensions will be effective so there are no logic about skipped dimensions.~~\n~~2. about nullSet when building inverted index both in IndexMaker and converting v8 to v9, it checks all dimension's null rows and make sure Dictionary and BitmapIndex are having these null rows. As mentioned in 1, the null values are treated properly in IncrementalIndex, so I did not handle this situation also.~~\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/167055261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/167059604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2155#issuecomment-167059604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2155","id":167059604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzA1OTYwNA==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T07:16:42Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T07:16:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:
