In fact, we've been considering whether support `stack` on `'time'` or event `'value'` axis, since it is a bit complicated than supporting it on `'category'` axis.\r\n\r\n@100pah: will it be simpler to support only a special case and not the general case to stack 2 different series (which may have data-samples at different time-stamps)?\r\n\r\ne.g. when you have measurement data, you often need to display the min and max values of a series (instead of just e.g. the average) to avoid aliasing: e.g. in the screenshot below we have one such series (1) is the maximum and (2) is the minimum: so each of the samples have a time-stamp and they always have min and

The data points are depicted correctly, but sometimes the lines are drawn correctly and sometimes (especially after interacting with the radar, i.e. hovering, tooltip, toolbox), the lines vanish and do not return.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM STATEMENT && VERSION:\r\nI use version 4.2.0-rc.2 of echarts.\r\nI have several indicators in radar, only two of them contain numeric values for the selected features, the rest is null. After selecting my features in map, I see the radar chart as expected (lines only connect the numeric points):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11268338/60514664-3eaf7300-9cda-11e9-9c2d-65bed8e40ca8.png)\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I hover over any item to force the tooltip to show, or open diagram (or sometimes when adding another feature to radar), the lines connecting the data points of a certain feature with null values disappear.  Also the point color of the hovered item spreads to several data points, that actually do not belong to the feature entry (see by comparing both images)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11268338/60514810-8cc47680-9cda-11e9-9dc4-c2c15a1e4d9c.png)\r\n\r\nThe lines will not come back by hovering or anything, also the \"restore\" toolbox-tool does not bring them back.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the lines should not vanish, but stay as in the first image.\r\n\r\nI hope I provided enough information and would be glad about any comment on this issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nChristian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/507669973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/507805145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/9893#issuecomment-507805145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/9893","id":507805145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzgwNTE0NQ==","user":{"login":"leoliu1984","id":47359584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzU5NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984","html_url":"https://github.com/leoliu1984","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leoliu1984/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T19:02:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T19:02:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,
