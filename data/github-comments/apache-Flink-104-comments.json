PR #1958 is a bigger change but in good shape and should be mergable soon. I would like to merge #1958 before this one, so you will need to rebase once this has happened.

I think you can rebase your code on top of #1958. \n\nOne last comment with respect to style fixes. Unfortunately, we do not have a strict code style in place that is automatically enforced and contributors follow sometimes different styles. We try to keep style changes in PRs to a minimum. Some changes make absolutely sense, but other changes might be reverted by the next person going over the file. Also style changes can distract from important changes. There is no hard rule for what to change, but a good rule of thumb is to leave code as it is if in doubt. \n\nThanks, Fabian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/219172614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/219182774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1991#issuecomment-219182774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1991","id":219182774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTE4Mjc3NA==","user":{"login":"houcros","id":7317712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTc3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7317712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros","html_url":"https://github.com/houcros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houcros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T23:27:34Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T23:27:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Happy to help :) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/219182774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/219203934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1220#issuecomment-219203934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1220","id":219203934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTIwMzkzNA==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-14T06:29:41Z","updated_at":"2016-05-14T06:29:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I would like to merge this PR.
