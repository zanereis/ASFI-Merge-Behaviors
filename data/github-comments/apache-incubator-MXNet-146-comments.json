With only Random crop, random flip, and scale augmentations, I am able to achieve an error rate of 30.5%, which is lower than 30.9% in https://github.com/tornadomeet/ResNet. So the conclusion should be valid. Since the evaluation is quite computational expensive. I will continue to train the models when spare GPUs are available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/269739977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/269740577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4447#issuecomment-269740577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4447","id":269740577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTc0MDU3Nw==","user":{"login":"tornadomeet","id":5860892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjA4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5860892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet","html_url":"https://github.com/tornadomeet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-30T07:19:25Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T07:19:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@taoari ResNet-18 which i trained is very bad! maybe for large batch-size, please ref the implementationof Microsoft which using R in MXNet, which >1% better than mine. https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/11/15/imagenet-deep-neural-network-training-using-microsoft-r-server-and-azure-gpu-vms/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/269740577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/269741819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1835#issuecomment-269741819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1835","id":269741819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTc0MTgxOQ==","user":{"login":"junlizhang","id":23089642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDg5NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23089642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang","html_url":"https://github.com/junlizhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junlizhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-30T07:39:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T07:39:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I met the same nullptr error talked before and tried using gcc4.8.5/4.9.4/5.3.1 all of them do not give some help.

The point is that **augmentations beyond random crop, random flip, and scale actually hurt the performance**.\r\n\r\nIn the above figure, I have included the comparison results for scale/aspect ratio/color augmentations. To compare with more advanced techniques, including random rotation, random shear, etc. augmentations, I have included your results.  For a fair comparison, I am using your results at the 95-th epoch. For ResNet-50, only scale augmentation achieved 74.55%, while scale/aspect ratio/color/rotation/shear  augmentations achieved 74.20%. For ResNet-18, since I had a full training (including the cancellation of the augmentations after the 95-th epoch), only scale augmentation achieved an error rate of 30.5% (accuracy 69.5%), while scale/aspect ratio/color/rotation/shear  augmentations achieved an error rate of 30.9% (accuracy 69.1%). Hence, the conclusion that  **augmentations beyond random crop, random flip, and scale actually hurt the performance** is valid.\r\n\r\nFor the curve above, we can also conclude that aspect ratio augmentation and JPEG compression almost had no effects on the final results. While color augmentation does hurt the performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/269761490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/269765801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4427#issuecomment-269765801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4427","id":269765801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTc2NTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"back2yes","id":8847006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDcwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8847006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes","html_url":"https://github.com/back2yes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/back2yes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-30T12:21:30Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T12:25:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It's good to see the references back!

It is the derivative w.r.t the conditional statement. For simple cases like whether the time index has exceeded the sequence length (for variable-length sequence input), there is no problem. However, if the conditional statement is a function of the input, say f(input)>0, it might be better to collect some statistics to decide which output choice is preferred, so that the conditional statement part of the network, f(), can be trained and updated as well. Sometimes, it might also be possible to update both paths according to their posterior likelihood, say 70% vs 30% respectively, instead of a boolean junction update where the winning branch takes all.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, things can go really tricky at the conditional
