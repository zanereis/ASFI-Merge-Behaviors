The reason is simple: I failed to create a proper test environment for the project infrastructure to work properly. The tests worked OK on a local machine all the time.\r\n1. the tests run in a pristine environment, with empty Maven repository. Project info load uses offline mode, it did not download Micronaut build plugin that knows `native-image` packaging. As a result, the project was unloadable / broken and defaulted to `pom` packaging, which broke service registrations.\r\n2. I attempted to fix that by 'priming' the project - which downloads the dependencies to the local repository. In theory, that was fine - but the test fixture lacked `ActiveDocumentProvider`. This caused the priming build to fail during startup, but the fail was silent - exception was swallowed. Again, this was locally visible only when one cleared the `~/.m2/repository` area.\r\n3. And finally, the JVMDI classes were required for one of the Checkers plugged into NB maven infrastructure.
