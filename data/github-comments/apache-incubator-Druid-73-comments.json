I am trying to get results grouped by **hour of day**.\n\nThe example above based on the Wikipedia example data set may not be clear, because that data set only contains data for a single day. Consider this alternate example data set: \n\n```\n{\"timestamp\": \"2013-08-29T01:02:33Z\", \"page\": \"Gypsy Danger\", \"added\": 57, \"deleted\": 200, \"delta\": -143}\n{\"timestamp\": \"2013-08-29T12:32:45Z\", \"page\": \"Striker Eureka\", \"added\": 459, \"deleted\": 129, \"delta\": 330}\n{\"timestamp\": \"2013-08-30T01:11:21Z\", \"page\": \"Cherno Alpha\", \"added\": 123, \"deleted\": 12, \"delta\": 111}\n{\"timestamp\": \"2013-08-31T11:58:39Z\", \"page\": \"Crimson Typhoon\", \"added\": 905, \"deleted\": 5, \"delta\": 900}\n{\"timestamp\": \"2013-08-31T12:41:27Z\", \"page\": \"Coyote Tango\", \"added\": 1, \"deleted\": 10, \"delta\": -9}\n```\n\nI've altered the timestamps a bit. Now, if I do a query similar to the first one in my original example but omitting the \"continent\" dimension but using the time extraction function, I should get three buckets, for the following values of \"hod\":\n\n\"01\" (count = 2: \"Gypsy Danger\" and \"Cherno Alpha\")\n\"11\" (count = 1: \"Crimson Typhoon\")\n\"12\" (count = 2: \"Striker Eureka\", \"Coyote Tango\")\n\n(An \"hour\" granularity query would return five buckets, right? That is not what I'm trying to get.)\n\nSo that works as expected for the query itself. But the same time extraction function in the filter, where say I might want to get results where hour of day is only \"01\", returns no results.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/196544548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/196547566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2568#issuecomment-196547566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2568","id":196547566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjU0NzU2Ng==","user":{"login":"nicktylah","id":6968226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjgyMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6968226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktylah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktylah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T22:25:42Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T22:25:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@fjy The compilation problem stems from a dependency I introduced in #2550 (the `server` module depends on the `indexing-service` module for access to necessary configuration settings).

We started using hadoop index tasks, so after using hadoop already only #2646 and #2645 were needed for druid to support google cloud storage through hadoop. I guess using hadoop in between is a bit slower but none of that stuff is time sensitive. The advantage is that druid in combination with hadoop, and hadoop with google cloud storage are much more tested than the code I wrote for this pull request.\n\nBefore this I did some testing where instead of #2645 I had hadoop index tasks with \"gs://\" output schemes create segments which the historical node could directly load using the code in this pull requests. So only the index tasks would require hadoop, everything else could access google cloud storage directly. I guess this is a bit faster and some people might like not having to rely on hadoop for their historical nodes to work.\n\nSo I guess one issue is, if you want to merge this, what should happend with \"gs://\" schemes? Should they generate hadoop segments like with #2645 or should they generate segments that can directly be downloaded using this pull request?\n\nSo I'm not sure what I should do with this pull request. I don't know if anyone is really interested in it. Maybe it's a better idea if I just contribute some documentation on how to use hadoop for google cloud storage like we do now?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/196628945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/196631120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2406#issuecomment-196631120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2406","id":196631120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjYzMTEyMA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T03:11:55Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T03:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pdeva @fjy ok, I am submitting the aggregators for quantiles/histograms in https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2660 .

A supervisor is created by providing a supervisor spec which includes fields for (among other things):\n- the Kafka topic to ingest\n- the number of indexing tasks to spawn\n- the number of events each task should handle before persisting a segment and completing\n- the number of indexing task replicas\n- an ingestion spec and configuration that will be passed down to the created Kafka indexing tasks\n\nThe supervisor will then periodically run the following sequence of steps:\n- get the current number of partitions for the topic from Kafka\n- get the current running tasks for the data source we are supervising\n- using this information, make sure that we have the expected number of tasks processing the Kafka partitions\n\nAs an example, say we have a Kafka topic with 6 partitions, we want to split these partitions across 2 tasks, with each task handling 3000 events, and we want a replication factor of 2. This will create 4 tasks:\n- Task 1: (partitions 0, 2, 4), offsets (P0: 0-1000, P2: 0-1000, P4: 0-1000) - Replica 1\n- Task 2: (partitions 1, 3, 5), offsets (P1: 0-1000, P3: 0-1000, P5: 0-1000) - Replica 1\n- Task 3: (partitions 0, 2, 4), offsets (P0: 0-1000, P2: 0-1000, P4: 0-1000) - Replica 2\n- Task 4: (partitions 1, 3, 5), offsets (P1: 0-1000, P3: 0-1000, P5: 0-1000) - Replica 2\n\n(Replica tasks are created with the same availability group so that they will be executed on different nodes.)\n\nIf:\n- Task 1 dies: the supervisor will create another task with the same parameters to maintain the desired replication factor: \n  - [Task 5: (partitions 0, 2, 4), offsets (P0: 0-1000, P2: 0-1000, P4: 0-1000)]\n- Task 1 succeeds: the supervisor will terminate redundant replicas after the segment has been published and will spawn tasks to handle the next range of offsets:\n  - kill Task 3\n  - create [Task 5: (partitions 0, 2, 4), offsets (P0: 1000-2000, P2: 1000-2000, P4: 1000-2000) - Replica 1]\n  - create [Task 6: (partitions 0, 2, 4), offsets (P0: 1000-2000, P2: 1000-2000, P4: 1000-2000) - Replica 1]\n\nAs of now, this implementation is fully functional but has a number of areas that can be refined to be more efficient / a better user experience (numbered to facilitate discussion):\n\n1) Currently, the supervisor waits for the previous set of tasks to complete before submitting the next set of tasks to handle the next offset range. This results in a pause in processing due to the time it takes to build/push/load the segment. No data is lost (assuming Kafka buffers all the messages during that time) but ingestion is bursty. We should be preemptively adding tasks to handle the next set of offsets as the previous set near the end of their range so that the new tasks begin handling data while the previous set are persisting. This requires being able to talk to the peons the tasks are running on and is enabled by #2419 .\n\n2) Currently, when a task completes (the segment is published and has been loaded by a historical), the supervisor will kill any replica tasks that are doing the same thing since it is now redundant. This generates a failed status, where it would be better to have it either show a successful or stopped status.\n\n3) Currently, the supervisor itself does not persist in any way and will die if the overlord crashes, restarts, or loses leadership in any other way. The supervisor spec should be written to metadata storage and read on overlord startup so that it can survive failures and cluster upgrades without the user needing to resubmit it every time. There already is an endpoint that can be used to stop running supervisors.\n\n4) Currently, all replicas are given an identical set of partitions/offset ranges to process and then independently do their thing. This produces correct final output, but could potentially lead to realtime queries returning different results, depending on which worker is queried by the broker and if that worker is unable to keep up with the data being pushed into Kafka and is lagging behind. A solution would be to implement a leader/follower mechanism where the followers would check with the leader to determine what offsets they should be reading which would improve synchronization between tasks.\n\n5) Currently there is no graceful shutdown mechanism for Kafka indexing tasks, which means that the supervisor is unable to provide any way of early stopping of spawned tasks. When the supervisor is stopped, it leaves the tasks running and they will continue to run until they have ingested up to the ending offset for all the partitions they are reading from. Early stopping (where the supervisor can tell the running tasks to stop ingesting, persist what they currently have, and then end) would make things like rolling updates somewhat nicer.\n\n6) Currently, when a new supervisor starts up, it gets a list of running tasks and kills any Kafka indexing task that is building segments for its data source that it did not create (it actually does this every time the main loop runs). This is to prevent situations where tasks created by a previous supervisor are running but have a different ingestion spec that will lead to offsets from Kafka being ingested twice (as the segment's sequenceName is based on the partitions/offsets being read, so a task reading different partitions will generate a different sequenceName which will generate a new segment containing duplicated data). It would be better if the supervisor inspected the Kafka indexing task to see if it was processing the same partitions/offsets and allow it to finish if it is safe, even if it wasn't the one who created the task.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/196988141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/196988878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2656#issuecomment-196988878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2656","id":196988878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Njk4ODg3OA==","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T19:38:02Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T19:38:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@himanshug @gianm as discussed during the dev sync, I've added some details into what is included in this PR and what enhancements could be added.

But if things are more balanced between mappers and reducers, then doing in-heap aggregation on the mappers incurs less mapper overhead than using a combiner (combiners involve serde and sorting costs). So it could be better or worse depending on the workload.\n\nIt's kind of a point of contention in the hadoop world though (some projects prefer combiners and some prefer in-heap aggregation…). Some even support both at the same time :)\n\nIt would certainly be good to know real numbers of this approach vs useCombiner for your workload, @navis. Even better if you could also share numbers of this approach + useCombiner used together vs either one alone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/197138042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/197141691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2670#issuecomment-197141691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2670","id":197141691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzE0MTY5MQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T03:57:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T03:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm let say very first row and very last row in the dataset are mergeable together, then only way you will merge them without combiner if you held the IncrementalIndex for that group key till very last moment.
