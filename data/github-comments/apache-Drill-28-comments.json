A user provided a \"short, fat\" query that had, as I recall, only 6000 rows but something like 200 columns. The numbers I posted were for the cost of doing the code generation for the rather large code (200 columns to be copied), amortized against a very short query. As @ilooner said, in this special case, there are no advantages to grinding the code generator, the cache lookup mechanism, the compiler and the byte-code merge mechanism, when a simple function call does the same job.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that for the same query with 1 TB of data, the results may be different. I didn't run that test. But, even a cursory look at the two code paths shows that the copier path is still more efficient, just looking at per-row costs, than the generated code.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple: the generated code to copy a value is a degenerate special case of code designed to fetch values, compute results, and create new columns, perhaps doing some casts along the way. The generated copy code is the fetch step and the save step with the compute part omitted.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, custom-built copier code will be more efficient than generic load-compute-save code.\r\n\r\nStill, would be great for someone to run a test at scale to verify this reasoning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/360014049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/360023338","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1085#issuecomment-360023338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1085","id":360023338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDAyMzMzOA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-24T05:15:23Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T05:15:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@amansinha100, rebased on master.

Please see latest commits for changes. I have made some additional changes after noticing that some of the batch sizing calculations were incorrect, I have also made various documentation and naming changes to improve the readability of the code and to document what needs to be improved in the future.:\r\n\r\n- The size of varchar columns were not properly accounted for in the outgoing batch in the case where varchars are aggregated. I have added logic to the updateEst... method to account for this.\r\n- I have added docs to the updateEst method explaining what the various batch sizing estimates do.\r\n- I have changed the variable names for the batch size estimates to more accurately reflect what they do.\r\n- Previously if a batch size estimate was smaller than the actual amount of memory allocated, the estimate was updated to be the larger size. I think this was actually the wrong behavior since it causes the HashAgg operator's memory estimates to be extremely aggressive and in the worst case can cause the operator to run out of memory prematurely. Ideally a good estimate will over estimate 50% of the time and under estimate 50% of the time.\r\n- I have changed the HashAgg defaults. Although tests passed with the previous defaults, I felt they were too aggressive. I have changed the default number of partitions to 16 and the minimum number of batches to 1.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have anymore comments. Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/362760848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/362761724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1101#issuecomment-362761724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1101","id":362761724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mjc2MTcyNA==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-03T01:35:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-03T01:35:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"An additional comment is that after the defaults were reduced the number of random failures we see in our functional tests decreased to just 3.

have reviewed the code and overall looks good. My main feedback is that the current implementation doesn't currently support secure clusters (at least didn't see any logic associated with that).
