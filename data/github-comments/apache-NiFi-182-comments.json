Is this test failing frequently in Github Actions? I don't quite understand how running the runner a second time and verifying no FlowFiles were transferred fixes the test.\r\n\r\n* Sorry for the late response. I detected that the test results are flaky using the NonDex tool for catching non-deterministic/flaky tests (https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex).\r\n\r\n  You may reproduce the nondeterministic behavior using the following steps:\r\n  Clone the repo and cd into it.\r\n`mvn install -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors -am -DskipTests`\r\n`mvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors test -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.QueryDatabaseTableTest#testAddedRowsTwoTables`\r\n`mvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.QueryDatabaseTableTest#testAddedRowsTwoTables`\r\n\r\n* I think I made a mistake in my previous descriptions. I think the real solve of flaky tests lies on the line `runner.setProperty(QueryDatabaseTableRecord.MAX_ROWS_PER_FLOW_FILE, \"0\");` due to some inconsistent or asychronized reading/writing. But I am not sure about this for now and still diving into the code to see what's the exact cause of this problem. I will let you know when I find more about it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1317673439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1317715562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6668#issuecomment-1317715562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6668","id":1317715562,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Oir5q","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-16T21:49:50Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T21:49:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the fix!

We try to avoid storing a large number of entries or big items in the state. I see the processor stores the fingerprints merged in a json in a single entry. What is the expected size of this state item?\r\n\r\nYes, I believe you do see it correctly. There is no upper bound for the number of these items, and it scales with the number of items in Asana. The fingerprint of a single item is a fixed 64 bytes, encoded in Base64, which is about 37% larger than this, so 80-90 bytes per item is expected. The whole list is gzipped, but as the hashes are traditionally non-compressible, I wouldn't expect much size deflation in the case of a fingerprint list. (approx. 11-12k items would fit in 1 MB compressed state)\r\n\r\nWhere Asana exposes the modification time (Tasks), or where the items are immutable (Attachments), I used the modification date / creation date as fingerprint, which are just text-represented integers with relatively small differences, and thus well compressible. In this case 4-8 bytes per item is expected. (approx. 130k items would fit in 1 MB compressed state)\r\n\r\nThere is an alternative solution, where I could utilize the Asana event API, which only requires storing a relatively short ID (less than 100 bytes), and that would notify us when an item is added, updated, or removed. The drawback is that, in this case we would need to fetch the affected items one by one, which may cause rate-limitation problems if there are more than 1500 items to fetch per minute. Another drawback is that we could apply this mechanism only for items having a parent item. Teams, Users, Tags don't have such, therefore in those cases I still need to use the current method, with fingerprints.\r\n\r\nSwitching to Event API requires a medium-sized change in the code. And almost all Asana integration tests would needed to be changed, because of mocks.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1321801319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1322046916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6688#issuecomment-1322046916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6688","id":1322046916,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5OzNXE","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-21T13:13:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T13:13:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1322046916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1322130675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6688#issuecomment-1322130675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6688","id":1322130675,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Ozhzz","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-21T14:16:43Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T14:16:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is it possible to add a unit test for this?

I've pushed the changes to remove the new `customValidation` and instead base the setting of Auth properties based upon the selected `AUTHORIZATION_SCHEME`, except for `PKI` and `SSLContext` as the

Although the proposed changes provide one potential solution, the additional swap and permute methods add some complexity to the unit test class. The check for the path attribute is helpful, but it seems like it would be simpler to just check that the path starts with the expected URL path, instead of attempting to check the entire string. This would avoid the need for the complex string parsing.\r\n\r\nThank you for your reply!
