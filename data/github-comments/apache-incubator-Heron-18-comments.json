To increase the limit (or to disable these warnings), see CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit() in google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h.\n```\n\nAnd here is the comments in coded_stream.h\n\n```\nHint: If you are reading this because your program is printing a warning about dangerously large protocol messages, you may be confused about what to do next. The best option is to change your design such that excessively large messages are not necessary. For example, try to design file formats to consist of many small messages rather than a single large one. If this is infeasible, you will need to increase the limit. Chances are, though, that your code never constructs a CodedInputStream on which the limit can be set. You probably parse messages by calling things like Message::ParseFromString(). In this case, you will need to change your code to instead construct some sort of ZeroCopyInputStream (e.g. an ArrayInputStream), construct a CodedInputStream around that, then call Message::ParseFromCodedStream() instead. Then you can adjust the limit. Yes, it's more work, but you're doing something unusual.\n```\n\nHowever, this error message is not redirected to file and stream mgr is run as a daemon process so it is tricky to figure it out.\n\nHere are what we could do:\n1. Redirect stdout&stderr in c++ program to glog (or file).\n2. Increase the limitation of protobuf size to parse (or make it configurable, but it is discouraged from google)\n3. Force the protobuf size (sent from heron-instance )smaller than the limitation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/227268468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/227270254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/956#issuecomment-227270254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/956","id":227270254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzI3MDI1NA==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T21:09:14Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T21:09:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I simply restarted CI and CI now passed.

However, for the getting-started use case it's easiest to have all running processes in a single container.  The workaround of using .bashrc within one container is not ideal so your suggestion to use an init system is great, it would be helpful if you could please submit or comment an example, thanks.\n- on the build comment, we removed the Bazel install for a smaller image and instead download install scripts from release.

This only requires creating a docker-compose.yml file, and using \"docker-compose up\" to start instead of \"docker run\". docker-compose effectively gives you a simple way to cause multiple docker containers to start/stop using a single command, which allows you to have a convenient local system (e.g. start multiple procs with a single command), as well as still use the \"one process per container convention\". It also keeps things a bit simpler than using an init system, but it can be complicated IF there are \"startup order\" issues, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nI'll submit a separate PR for this to avoid any confusion. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/227554481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/227555858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/849#issuecomment-227555858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/849","id":227555858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzU1NTg1OA==","user":{"login":"alanngai","id":1654394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTQzOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1654394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai","html_url":"https://github.com/alanngai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanngai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T20:07:07Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T20:07:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nlu90, can you give me the steps to reproduce, as well as instructions on how to set things up so that I can see the page you' referring to?
