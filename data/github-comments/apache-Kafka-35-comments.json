Got it, I feel this is a good motivation to dynamically change partitioning behaviors, and will also help in translating the higher-level DSL's join operations to co-partition the joining streams / tables. \n\nWhat I mean by is that currently users need to use `map` in order to co-partition the joining streams on the same key type, while in the future this could be abstracted from them, and as a result Kafka Streams will do the re-partitioning automatically that generates intermediate Kafka streams that are not exposed to users.\n\nRegarding the proposed PR, its API change makes sense to me as well.

I have a serialized version of the object written to file under resources folder. The de-serialization is happening from this file...hence if something changes in the new version of the class any incompatibility should be caught and de-serialization will fail (as de-serialization is still trying to use the older serialized object in file).
