For example, in the class there is a function:\r\n    `  slipCell method() {}`\r\n\r\nand although the class name was changed, the return type in the method description did not.\r\n\r\nAnd so in a fit of pique I used some Linux commands and changed them all by hand. Ah, the life of a programmer is beset with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThanks for the time you spent. Sorry that I didn't get back to you sooner. I 'lost' the email somewhere and only after a desultory search found it.\r\n\r\nI am really sorry if I've cause any anguish. I did not mean to do that.\r\n\r\nart","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1919730653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1919731394","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7019#issuecomment-1919731394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7019","id":1919731394,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ybMbC","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-31T18:52:25Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T18:52:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> fascinating.

The intention is now not to get a stack trace (you did that already), but get the info what files are modified/tried to be read.\r\n\r\n1. Start your \"Work\" IDE like this: \r\n  `<PATH_TO_NETBEANS>\\bin\\netbeans64.exe -J-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=1044`\r\n    This will launch the IDE in a \"debuggable\" mode. The debug agent listens now on TCP port 1044 for a debugger. The `-J` indicates to the NetBeans launcher that the rest of the option should be passed to the java launcher itself. That is instructed to load the debugger agent (jdwp) and configured to start in server mode, not to supend execution and listen to TCP port 1044.\r\n2. Do what you need to do, to get it into its \"broken\" state\r\n3.  Launch the debugging IDE (yeah, needs a different userdir):\r\n  `<PATH_TO_NETBEANS>\\bin\\netbeans64.exe --userdir c:/temp/debugging`\r\n4. Ensure, that in the Plugin Manager (Tools -> Plugins -> Installed) the \"Java SE\" is Choose DebuActive and if it is not, activate it\r\n5. Choose \"Debug -> Attach Debugger\", ensure \"Java Debugger (JPDA)\" is selected as \"Debugger\", as Connector choose \"SocketAttach\", as \"Host\" choose \"localhost\", as Port \"1044\". \"Ok\" that:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/54d512ac-ee59-436b-b446-9cfbc90e67fb)\r\n6. NetBeans now switches to debugging view and on the left side you will see a list of threads:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/8be2d8dc-097a-46e8-a45c-cbe62b803041)\r\n   And on the lower border you see Variables and Breakpoints. Variables becomes active, once a a thread is stopped.\r\n7. In the debugging view you can suspend threads by clicking on the \"Pause\"-Symbol (at the end of the corresponding line), The view then changes and show a stack trace for that thread. You can now activate each stack frame by double clicking on it (it is then printed in bold) and in the Variables view you can see the variables in the stack frame:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/90cf0c5b-91aa-4b46-990d-d2d54329ab59)\r\n\r\nIn this case I clicked \"Pause\" on the \"exec_JNA...\" Thread and then double clicked the \"WinNTFileSystem.delete:625\" line. As the runtime JDK matches the JDK of the debugged IDE, the source code in the JDK is automatically opened. In the example we can see, that `f` is the passed in file and when I expand it, I can see the backing path.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is of course not a reproduction of your situation, but the idea is, that you repeat that against your \"Work IDE\" and check the threads, that you can identify in the stacktrace. In these threads check the stack frames to see whether you can identify which file is passed to `java.io.WinNTFileSystem.checkAccess`. \r\n\r\nFurther checks can be done using the breakpoint function. For example you can create a methdo break point like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/2c86c922-e4f6-4aaf-9ebe-4d5b0e7fc324)\r\n\r\nThe red marked icon is \"Create new breakpoint\".\r\n\r\nYou can now choose what kind of breakpoint you want to create. This way you would get a break on each call to `checkAccess:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/cd2b625b-8ef4-43e5-b783-ebc10a512086)\r\n\r\nBe warned though: Method Breakpoints are slow.\r\n\r\nWhen a break point is hit, you get this view:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/009c5c40-3f55-4c5e-962d-5f11a8651aa1)\r\n\r\nYou see on the left the debugging view highlights the current active stack frame, in Breakpoints view the breakpoint that was hit is highlighted. You can now switch to \"Variables\", change the active stack frame and inspect the variables:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/00d0d31e-1487-4da6-ac4e-f9195f30aac9)\r\n\r\nIn the example `checkAccess` is called from `File#canWrite` and is invoked on the path `z:\\\\src\\\\jnalib\\\\contrib\\\\platform\\\\build.xml`.\r\n\r\nTo continue execution, you can now allow execution to allow for the thread using the play button in \"Debugging\" tab or by choosing \"Continue\" in the debugging toolbar: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/823a6444-81f5-47c7-b0b0-4d1d4b6b25f6)\r\n\r\nBreakpoints can be removed at any time, if execution is topped because a breakpoint was hit, the thread stays suspended until you allow execution again.\r\n\r\nIf you find problem, use the \"stop\" button in the debugging toolbar. The Debugging IDE will disconnect from the debugged IDE. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps a bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1925835316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1925841395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6992#issuecomment-1925841395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6992","id":1925841395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5yygHz","user":{"login":"tmysik","id":331924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik","html_url":"https://github.com/tmysik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-04T17:10:59Z","updated_at":"2024-02-04T17:10:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good to me now.

(no actual files, only directories) Like recursion gone wrong. Window file explorer and command line tools wouldn't delete the tree so had to write custom java code to nuke it. Once gone, Git seems to be perfectly happy. The project with offending tree was not one I was using but it was still open in NB. How the file tree got created in the first place remains a complete mystery but it was one where I was experimenting with different tools to package code and JRE into a  single executable. \r\n\r\nMatthias - you are a scholar and a gentleman.  I cant imagine how I would have found this without your help. Gittrefresh was first thread I tried and the weird file path caught my eye the moment I got variables up though I was looking checkAccess.
