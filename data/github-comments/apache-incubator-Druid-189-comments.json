But some related things are possible.\r\n\r\nEssentially the `druid.coordinator.merge.on` and related \"merge\" and \"append\" tasks were created to do merging of segments \"horizontally\" across the timeline. The idea being that if you have a bunch of single, small hourly segments then they may merge them into larger 4-hourly, 5-hourly, whatever segments. They are limited in that they only work on unsharded segments.\r\n\r\nKafka ingestion (as you may be aware) often creates more than one segment per interval. And also, because it can accept late data, it doesn't make so much sense to do merges \"horizontally\".\r\n\r\nThe ongoing work being referred to in the docs is compaction (http://druid.io/docs/latest/ingestion/tasks.html#compaction-task) and auto compaction (#5102). That work can also merge sharded segments \"vertically\" -- meaning it can do things like merge a dozen small hourly segments _for the same hour_ into a smaller number of hourly segments _for the same hour_. There is enough there in master to try out auto-compaction. And even older versions (ones that have actually been released) have the ability to do manual compaction through the compaction task, or even through Hadoop jobs using the `dataSource` inputSpec.\r\n\r\nFuture work is intended to include \"super compaction\", i.e. automatically scaling it out, possibly with an option to do it with or without Hadoop.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is that you just flip a switch and it happens in the background, regardless of the method of ingestion you originally chose (kafka, batch, something custom, etc).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/393049462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/393049786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5807#issuecomment-393049786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5807","id":393049786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzA0OTc4Ng==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T06:50:50Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T06:50:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @awelsh93, could you please fill out the project CLA so we can accept this contribution?

Thanks for explaining. It sounds like you want an 'anonymous' user that would potentially have some permissions attached to it.

The reasons are\r\n\r\n- Moving audit logs to deep storage requires quite a lot of changes and introduces new design issues like audit log formats (single JSON per file, all JSONs in a single file, etc), log file name convention, how to efficiently search inserted/deleted segments from logs, how to manage increasing logs (like automatic cleanup) and so on. I don't want to make an effort for this kind of issue that there may not be a good use case.\r\n- If there is any use case for `http://<OVERLORD_IP>:<port>/druid/indexer/v1/task/{taskId}/segments`, moving audit logs to deep storage will cause performance regression issue. \r\n  - At first, I tried to address this issue by using a combination of inserted/deleted segment IDs as the file name, but it's not feasible because 1) there can be a lot of inserted/deleted segments and 2) some task actions requiring auditing (like `ResetDataSourceMetadataAction`) doesn't have segment information.\r\n- If there is any user application based on `taskLog` table, there is still a workaround of increasing max size of a blob.\r\n\r\n@gianm @jon-wei what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/394230691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/394295945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4575#issuecomment-394295945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4575","id":394295945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDI5NTk0NQ==","user":{"login":"zhxiaom5","id":10976459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc2NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10976459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5","html_url":"https://github.com/zhxiaom5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T09:41:43Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T09:41:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just check out，we still use foreach topN ，any help would be greate ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/394295945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/394299561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4117#issuecomment-394299561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4117","id":394299561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDI5OTU2MQ==","user":{"login":"zhxiaom5","id":10976459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc2NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10976459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5","html_url":"https://github.com/zhxiaom5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhxiaom5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T09:55:03Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T09:55:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the end, I stil use a historical node, and I use kafka index service to replace tranquilty.

slow.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/395838243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/395867103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5861#issuecomment-395867103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5861","id":395867103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTg2NzEwMw==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-08T19:37:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T19:37:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nishantmonu51
