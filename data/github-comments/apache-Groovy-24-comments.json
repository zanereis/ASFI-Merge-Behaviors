We install a CachedCallableCallsite, which will have similar logic to before, meaning we do the normal method selection, then install a method as primary target and if all the guards fail (or all callsites get reset by meta class logic) we fallback to now not a new select, but to another guard that first checks with cacheHits if the cache contains the method and sets the new target in a ThreadLocal. If it exists we use fromCache, which basically gets the handle from the ThreadLocal and in case of a cache miss we do select again, but select will always add the new selections to the cache. To determine if it is a cache hit we use the class name of the receiver. Oh, and select will also (as before) set a new target for the callsite.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is correct I do have a few problems with this:\r\n- you should always have a micro benchmark for this sort of thing. Yes, micro benchmarks are evil, but in this case you are trying to optimize something very small, so it is going to be micro, if not nano. \r\n- unless changed ThreadLocal is a performance killer. It introduces a barrier which is preventing method inlining.\r\n- a call x.foo(y) may add a handle X#foo(Y1) in the cache, but if y changes to Y2 your cache will still return X#foo(Y1), even though y may not be an instance of Y1. You will have to check the argument types. In java and static Groovy the receiver check would be enough, in Groovy (because of double dispatch) not. And of course if X changes to a class of same name but different loader, then the handle for X#foo(Y1) would be invalid as well. \r\n\r\nLet me suggest an alternative approach... if the end up to select the method again, then use old callsite target as fallback for the new handle. That way you create a giant method handle that is the cache, forcing the JVM to optimize the whole thing. Of course there are x more steps to improve that, but it would be a simple start. (we may want to limit the length, reorder according to the number of calls, maybe have some weakly referenced to avoid class unloading issues, and maybe other things, but all that needs a benchmark to go by and prove it is an improvement really) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/570808378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/570811643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1135#issuecomment-570811643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1135","id":570811643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDgxMTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T19:14:53Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T20:58:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jochen, you got the point ;-) The main idea can be described as the following simplified code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (cacheHits(receiverCassName)) { // Try to find the cached MethodHandle\r\n      // the main logic of `fromCache`\r\n      MethodHandle mh = lruCache.get(receiverCassName); // find the cached MethodHandle again...\r\n      return mh.invokeExact(...);\r\n} else { // fallback, and put the fallback methodhandle to the inline cache(LRU) for reuse\r\n      // the main logic of `selectMethod`\r\n      Selector selector = Selector.getSelector(...);\r\n      selector.setCallSiteTarget();\r\n      MethodHandle mh = selector.handle.asSpreader(...).asType(MethodType.methodType(Object.class, Object[].class));\r\n      lruCache.put(receiverCassName, mh); // cache the methodhandle \r\n      return mh.invokeExact(...);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the inline cache is implemented as LRU cache, and `cacheHits` and `fromCache` are executed in two steps(not atomic), so if `cacheHits` returns `true`(means cached methodhandle found), `fromCache` find the same cached methodhandle from LRU cache again, the result probably is `null` as cached methodhandle may be cleared according to the rule of LRU...

You say setTarget is causing the bad performance... there is a hit involved with that yes, but in my experience creating all those MethodTypes is just as bad. Maybe that part got improved. In my opinion your implementation should be much slower now for the regular case... Especially you hitting the cache every time should cause some bad effects... I guess there is only testing.. then let us call cs the normal groovy callsite caching as we have, indy1 the current indy on master, indy2 master with your changes including the removal of the ThreadLocal. Also better would be to run multiple times and only get the best ones (using java11u28)\r\n\r\n```Java\r\ndef m(i){1}\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100_000_000; i++) {\r\n if (m(i)!=1) throw new Error(\"??\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI run this up to 20 times to get the best stable time\r\nCS: ~510ms\r\nindy1: ~256ms\r\nindy2: ~12680ms\r\n\r\nwhich more or less shows what I expected. The effect of indy1 being faster than CS, is because the JVM actually has more options to optimize in indy and the guards here are very simple. With more parameters in the call indy would loose performance compared to CS. For indy2 I did expect it to be worse than indy1, but actually not that much. On the other hand I was already expecting form the code, that going to the cache every time is going to hurt.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\ndef same(String obj) { return obj }\r\ndef same(int obj) { return obj }\r\ndef same(float obj) { return obj }\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {\r\n    [1, 1.0f, '1.0'].each { same(it) }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCS: ~64ms\r\nindy1: ~2250ms\r\nindy2: ~2000ms\r\n\r\nThis was the case I was really curious about. There is an improvement, but too small yet. So I did an experiment... \r\n```diff\r\n@@ -883,7 +884,7 @@ public abstract class Selector {\r\n             if (handle == null) return;\r\n             if (!cache) return;\r\n \r\n-            MethodHandle fallback = makeFallBack(callSite, sender, name, callType.ordinal(), targetType, safeNavigationOrig, thisCall, spread);\r\n+            MethodHandle fallback = callSite.getTarget();\r\n \r\n             // special guards for receiver\r\n             if (receiver instanceof GroovyObject) {\r\n```\r\nwhich means instead of always falling back to the select method I instead reuse the existing handle in the callsite as fallback. That means, that each select call will cause a bigger handle, the newest on top, having the older as fallback. If I then have a callsite [1, 1.0f, '1.0'].each { same(it) } I will get a one handle for the string, which falls back to the float, which falls back to the int, which falls back to the select method. I did not test this for being correct or anything, and even if correct it is still having overhead it does not need, but well... let's compare...\r\n\r\nIn the first test the performance of my version and the old indy version are about the same, because the handle, that is produced is the same. Anything else would have been strange. In the second test I get 65ms, so roughly the same as CS. Sure, there may be a deopt because of setTarget, which happens in the inner loop 3 times. But after that the callsite is stable and has still 99999 iterations to run and optimize.\r\n\r\nI was wondering why your versions is so extremely slow and I think it is because of the receiver based cache you use. Sure you cache the handle, but the key is the receiver.\r\n```Java\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {\r\n    [1, 1.0f, '1.0'].each { it.toString() }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this variant the receiver will change, giving your caching a chance to actually do its work and not fail with cache misses all the time\r\n\r\nCS: ~770ms\r\nindy1: ~14600ms (I stopped after 4 iterations)\r\nindy2:  ~639ms\r\nindy3:  ~215ms\r\n(static compiled Groovy: ~110ms)\r\n\r\nHere I can see your factor 3 you talked about earlier. And the indy3 version shows that there is even more to gain.\r\n\r\nOne last case I´d like to showcase\r\n```Java\r\nclass Cat {\r\n  static m(Script s){println \"x\"}\r\n}\r\ndef m(){}\r\n\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {\r\n  use(Cat) {\r\n     m()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this version we have an category active. This category is not even going to be used, but the effect is really bad:\r\n\r\nCS: starts with ~180ms, ends with ~2000ms\r\nindy1: starts with ~2500ms, ends with ~7000ms\r\nindy2: starts with ~2300ms, ends with ~6650ms\r\nindy3: StackOverflowError\r\n\r\nI consider indy1 and indy2 being about equal here, but you may ask why there is a StackOverflowError for indy3. That is because at least one of the guards (I think it is the exception guard, which also degrades performance a lot) causes additional stack usage. That is already the case for the handle we produce in the selector. Older versions of Java did still show this, it seems in Java11 this is now hidden... well.. considering https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8016334 this is the case for a much longer time, but with -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+ShowHiddenFrames you can make them visible again:\r\n```\r\n\tat groovy.lang.MetaClassImpl.invokeMethod(MetaClassImpl.java:1027)\r\n\tat
