(In general if this was not the test code some of this code will be in constructor. Coming to constructors, there is much more repeatable code there in many cloudstack classes.) Now this might not look good to you and some others too. I suggest if that is the case take some effort and put up a code style guideline or at least adopt a guideline that already exists so that we donot have to go thru this. This will also be food for further cleanup as findbug and code style check already are CC: @bhaisaab @remibergsma @DaanHoogland @cristofolini.
