In such cases, force committing based on the first responsive replica rather than winning replica seems appropriate.\r\n\r\nAssuming my previous comment/reading of the code above is correct, when your ingestion is stuck and you call this, you will at most wait 3.3 more seconds for a winner. In practice, it's likely minutes before you've noticed ingestion is stuck.\r\n\r\nBut in the case where 1 server is significantly behind (in our case 2 hours behind), accidentally picking it has pretty big ramifications. Now every server is 2 hours behind for those partitions.\r\n\r\nThere's also very few cases where the wait period is skipped (only row limit and end of partition reached). Even for time based or size based segment completion, the protocol still waits, and that doesn't seem to be a problem. I'll wait to hear from @sajjad-moradi, but I would be strongly in favor of undoing this part of the force commit feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1482056208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1482063141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10460#issuecomment-1482063141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10460","id":1482063141,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5YVn0l","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-23T23:58:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T23:58:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with @jadami10 that there is a timeout of 3.3s  to pick the winner with the best offset, so it may be useful to wait out that time. \r\nI just don't recall the full discussion, so I will let @sajjad-moradi  chime in here (he will be back Monday)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1482063141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1482093028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10442#issuecomment-1482093028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10442","id":1482093028,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5YVvHk","user":{"login":"claudeyj","id":42714590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzE0NTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42714590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj","html_url":"https://github.com/claudeyj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-24T00:37:54Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T00:38:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Another attempt: #10468\r\n\r\nThis PR looks good to me but previously another developer @zhtaoxiang worries about whether replacing HashMap would lead to performance degradation (in #10445 ).

I think for a normal SQL database the answer is, \"kind of\". You drop a table by typing out `DROP TABLE <table_name>` where you're effectively doing what's asked here. Github makes you type out the repo name if you're going to delete it. I can't find the post mortem, but I believe AWS and other companies have moved to requiring a second human sign off on (like actively run some command or approve on website) any destructive commands.\r\n\r\nAll of that said, I think I agree with the ask here. I think anyone running Pinot in prod and relying on the current UI would welcome this feature. If we're worried someone's workflow would really be harmed by this, maybe we can add a \"do not ask again for X days\" checkbox?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1482995532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1483090178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10449#issuecomment-1483090178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10449","id":1483090178,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5YZikC","user":{"login":"somandal","id":47411403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDExNDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47411403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal","html_url":"https://github.com/somandal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somandal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-24T16:33:23Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T16:33:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> this PR assumes the mailbox receive will generate ordered block appropriately, correct? if so could we please state so in the javadoc of window aggregate operator?\r\n\r\nThanks for the review!

Jackie, yeah, the query is contrived to expose the bug. I actually encountered it while writing a query rewriter:\r\n\r\n1. `SELECT * FROM table WHERE clpMatch(\"message\", '*123*')`\r\n    is parsed into a `PinotQuery` that's equivalent to \r\n    `SELECT * FROM table WHERE clpMatch(\"message\", '*123*') = true`.\r\n2. Then the custom rewriter replaces `clpMatch` so the query becomes something like\r\n    `SELECT * FROM table WHERE (message_logtype = ... AND message_dictionaryVars LIKE '*123*' ...) = true`,\r\n    where `message_dictionaryVars` is an MV column. So the query fails with the above error.\r\n    \r\nI'm currently working around this by specially detecting the boolean comparison with `clpMatch`, but it would be great to resolve this correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1486035883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1486045217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10487#issuecomment-1486045217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10487","id":1486045217,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Yk0Ah","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-28T00:38:00Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T20:00:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10487?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10487](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10487?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (432d6d4) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/316842f66e8470ba03042bd5e4d41e09e1d73492?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (316842f) will **decrease** coverage by `56.35%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10487       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n- Coverage     70.30%   13.95%   -56.35%     \n+ Complexity     6113      237     -5876     \n=============================================\n  Files          2070     2037       -33     \n  Lines        112037   109750     -2287     \n  Branches      17071    16793      -278     \n=============================================\n- Hits          78765    15320    -63445     \n- Misses        27721    93182    +65461     \n+ Partials       5551     1248     -4303     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `?` | |\n| integration2 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `?` | |\n| unittests2 | `13.95% <0.00%> (-0.04%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
