So what I had in mind was using our own same old avro java bean for keeping things in-memory, but when pushing this into Cassandra, then (1) store everything as avro binary data (serialize every type as binary data as we did), or (2) use cassandra native serialization so users can use regular CQL for checking their data. \r\nYou accomplished the same :) BUT now we have also introduced a different in-memory data bean which will not help in keeping a single entry-point for all no-sql databases (now we need Cassandra java beans).  I think we could just go back to use our own avro data beans and use the native serialization you have coded, and then later handling the avro binary serialization. What do you think? how much work would it be?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/319589069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/320265424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/114#issuecomment-320265424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/114","id":320265424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDI2NTQyNA==","user":{"login":"djkevincr","id":1346010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1346010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr","html_url":"https://github.com/djkevincr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djkevincr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T14:35:37Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T14:35:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@oscerd This is great.
