Another thing: it has probably already come up but I just want to make sure, you implement CoGroup and Reduce the way you do because of performance, correct? That is, you don't do any work in the user code of a ReduceOperator but you do it in a chained MapPartition because there you get all the elements which makes communication with the python process more efficient. Same with CoGroup, where you implement your own grouping logic in python from the raw input streams.\n\nOverall I like the architecture, the communication between the host and the guest language is well abstracted and I can see this being reused for other languages.\n\nCould you rename the CoGroupPython\\* classes to something more generic?

The problem is, that the package name is now flink-generic, it pops up like this in maven central and so on without the information that it is actually a sub package of flink-language-binding. This could be quite confusing.\n\nIn MapFunctin.py and FilterFunction.py you use map() and filter() respectively. These operations are not lazy, i.e. in map() it does first apply the user map-function to every element in the partition and then it collects the results. This can become a problem if the input is very big. Instead we should iterate over the iterator and output each element after mapping. This keeps memory consumption low. Same applies to filter().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77127742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77131171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/451#issuecomment-77131171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/451","id":77131171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTMxMTcx","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-04T10:26:27Z","updated_at":"2015-03-04T10:26:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Data is often stored in text delimited formats and one of the nice features of Flink is the ability to work with POJOs. Therefore some mechanism to map from delimited files to POJOs is useful.\n\nHowever, I have found that such mappings are rarely restricted to the simple cases. Therefore might I suggest that some other factors be considered as part of this request so as not to limit the usefulness of and to provide some extensibility with this API change:\n- The position fields within the delimited file and how they are mapped to POJO properties could indeed be modelled with a `String[]` as suggested. However, this will be arduous to maintain and prone to human error for types with a large number of fields. An alternative could be to have a `@Position` annotation on the POJO object fields to indicate the CSV column index.\n\n```\n  public class MyPojo {\n    @Position(0)\n    public int id;\n\n    @Position(1)\n    public String name;\n    ...\n```\n- Flink + POJOs bring the benefit of richer types to data processing pipelines. But it seems to me that this implementation imposes a restriction on the range of types that can be used within the target POJO type negating this benefit somewhat. If I want to use a POJO with a `DateTime` field then I must still create my own mapping function to do so. Therefore It would be useful to provide some hook into the CSV-POJO mapping process to allow the specification of user declared/defined type converters. This can then enable users to easily map to field types of their choosing. Again, this could be modelled as an annotation:\n\n```\n  public class MyPojo {\n    // DateTimeConverter implemented by the user\n    @Converter(type=DateTimeConverter.class, properties=\"format=yyyy/MM/dd:HH;timezone=Europe/London\")\n    public DateTime id;\n    ...\n```\n\nYou might consider that these additional features are better served by some separate type-mapping component or API (and I'd probably agree). But in that case is it then wise to also add a simpler, less flexible form to the core Flink API?\n\nThank you for your time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77347164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77358774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/426#issuecomment-77358774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/426","id":77358774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzU4Nzc0","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T12:54:09Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T12:54:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Those are very good points! Having an annotation for POJO fields to define their order in the PojoTypeInfo (and therefore the order in which the fields are mapped to CSV fields) is a nice idea.\n\nThe String[] parameter to select POJO fields would still be good because it\n- makes the POJO type and the CSV field independent of each other and\n- allows to fill only a subset of POJO fields.\n\nHaving a way to provide logic to parse a String into a custom/not-natively-supported type is also important for POJOs. I would however, make that independent of the POJO and add it as a parameter to the CsvReader. That way you don't need to touch existing POJO code and make it again independent of the data source (imagine CSV files with different date formats).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77358774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77360696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/455#issuecomment-77360696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/455","id":77360696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzYwNjk2","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T13:09:03Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T13:09:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I addressed your comments and merged the pull request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77360696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77361454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/450#issuecomment-77361454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/450","id":77361454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzYxNDU0","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T13:14:48Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T13:14:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well.

Thanks for the example :))\nI'm a bit confused about the directed / undirected case. I tried testing with both a directed and an undirected input and both my tests failed.. See [here](http://gist.github.com/vasia/ad68268118b6f895cf7c#file-lcc-example-tests) are the test cases I tried.\nI suppose the directed case doesn't work because you only consider the out-neighbors, when you should count all. And for the undirected case, I think that the division by 2 you're making is giving a wrong result, because you're not counting edges, just out-neighbors again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/77687686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
