believe the reverts in #1648 would go well in this PR and could accomplish the goal in the PR title. I would be very interested in a cherry-pick of a22de15, f3e8a03, and 33ed323 to this branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/267744503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/267744562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1612#issuecomment-267744562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1612","id":267744562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzc0NDU2Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-17T05:30:52Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T05:30:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

If there are dangling nodes of both types than `PAssert` takes precedence and it is the one reported to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `PipelineAbandonedNodeEnforcement` is now active by default\r\n(`enableAutoRunIfMissing` is `false` by default, as it was prior to the latest change).\r\n\r\nLet me know how it looks.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI'm really contemplating between `Abandoned` and `Dangling` in all that relates to naming. At the moment it is all `abandoned` but for some reason I feel that `dangling` might be more intuitive for users to understand and relate to. \r\nPlus, if I were a node I think I would prefer to be `dangling` rather than `abandoned`.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? :)\r\n\r\nP.S.^2\r\nI think it's worth mentioning that since now that `TestPipeline` is a `TestRule`, it should be treated somewhat carefully in the presence of other `TestRule`s that alter execution flows by overriding `TestRule#apply()`, e.g. the `ExpectedException` rule which is so commonly used. By carefully, I mean one should consider the order of the `TestRule`s present in a test class. For example (taken from the test suite for `TestPipeline` as a JUnit rule):\r\n```java\r\n@Rule\r\npublic RuleChain ruleOrder = RuleChain.outerRule(exception).around(pipeline);\r\n```\r\nIt may be hard to determine which combination is the RIGHT one because it depends on the user's expectation of a given test, so this note is here to bring it up as a consideration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/267754455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/267755096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1595#issuecomment-267755096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1595","id":267755096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzc1NTA5Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-17T10:21:03Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T10:21:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
