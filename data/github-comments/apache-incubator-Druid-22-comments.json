at what that class does, it basically just extends Log4j's ShutdownCallbackRegistry.  It's pretty difficult to do programmatic stuff to adjust the configuration of the log4j subsystem when you use properties files to initialize it.  We essentially need to set the system property before the log4j system is initialized.  \n\nI believe it is initialized by the first call to `LoggerFactory.getLogger()` in `com.metamx.common.logging.Logger`.\n\nSo, if we were to actually add a static initializer there to set the system property for us, we would likely be able to register our own shutdown handler instead of having it use the internal one.\n\nI would then recommend that we create our own ShutdownCallbackRegistry that\n1. Registers with the normal JVM shutdown hook\n2. On `start()` removes the JVM shutdown hook\n3. On `close()`, if `start()` was called, shuts things down, if `start()` was not called, is a noop.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/106109657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/106113069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1370#issuecomment-106113069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1370","id":106113069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjExMzA2OQ==","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-27T23:52:49Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T23:52:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Aside from a nit about changes in one file just for the sake of making changes, this generally LGTM.\n\nI just realized that we should also optimize and rewrite filters at this level.

This is definitely a bug, but this fix will break other stuff.  The bug is that in the `rowUpdater.getNumRows() > config.getMaxIntermediateRows()` case (i.e. we have generated more rows than we need), we need to advance the cursor, which is currently not happening and will cause the row to be processed twice.\n\nHowever, in the `unprocessedKeys` case, that means that we didn't have enough memory to actually store all of the keys and actually do need to reprocess the row.  The reprocessing is done in the `if` block before the while loop and is safe to not have the cursor advanced.  So, the fix should really be to separate out the `if` into two checks\n\n```\nif (unprocessedKeys != null) {\n  break;\n}\n\ncursor.advance();\nif(rowUpdater.getNumRows() > config.getMaxIntermediateRows()) {\n  break\n}\n```\n\nWhich means that the last chunk can probably just be put into the while condition:\n\n```\nwhile (!cursor.isDone() &&  rowUpdater.getNumRows() < config.getMaxIntermediateRows()) {\n  ByteBuffer key = ByteBuffer.allocate(dimensions.size() * Ints.BYTES);\n\n  unprocessedKeys = rowUpdater.updateValues(key, dimensions);\n  if (unprocessedKeys != null) {\n    break;\n  }\n\n  cursor.advance();\n}\n```\n\nThat said, we should definitely have some unit tests for this!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/107657280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/108021185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1370#issuecomment-108021185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1370","id":108021185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODAyMTE4NQ==","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-02T17:14:31Z","updated_at":"2015-06-02T17:14:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1:
