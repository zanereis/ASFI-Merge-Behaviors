created an IT that would recreate the problem. The IT would try to modify a few rows using lots of threads.  I found the following bugs :+1: \n- `LoadTask` and `WorkTask` both retry when a collision occurs.  When the code retries it creates a new `TransactionImpl` but does not  close the one from the previous attempt.  Not closing the `TransactionImpl` when retrying prevents updating state in ZK needed for GC.\n- Found that when a TX deletes a notification it uses its commit timestamp.  It should use its start timestamp.  This could cause deletion of notification that was not processed.\n- Found that when a weak notification is created, it uses the start timestamp.  Should use the commit timestamp.

Eventually the counts came out correct!\n\n```\n[ec2-user@leader1 fluo-stress]$ ./bin/print.sh 2>/dev/null\nTotal at root : 3992004\nNodes Scanned : 15259\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/86769114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/87101349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/459#issuecomment-87101349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/459","id":87101349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTAxMzQ5","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T21:48:20Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T21:48:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I saw a few problem when trying to run stress w/ local commands.\n\nThe error message when there is no app given could be improved\n\n```\n$ ./bin/local-fluo start-worker \nERROR - Fluo application  needs a directory in apps/ with a conf/ and lib/ directory\n```\n\nThe worker could not find stress classes.\n\n```\n17:37:39.382 [pool-7-thread-7] ERROR i.f.c.worker.NotificationProcessor - Failed to process work 08:h8kq:08:0000000017e9f4d0 count wait \njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.fluo.stress.trie.NodeObserver\n    at io.fluo.core.worker.Observers.getObserver(Observers.java:78) ~[fluo-core-1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT]\n    at io.fluo.core.worker.WorkTask.run(WorkTask.java:51) ~[fluo-core-1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT]\n    at io.fluo.core.worker.NotificationProcessor$2.run(NotificationProcessor.java:125) ~[fluo-core-1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145) [na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615) [na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) [na:1.7.0_72]\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.fluo.stress.trie.NodeObserver\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:366) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:355) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:354) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:425) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:308) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:358) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:191) ~[na:1.7.0_72]\n    at io.fluo.core.worker.Observers.getObserver(Observers.java:73) ~[fluo-core-1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT.jar:1.0.0-beta-1-SNAPSHOT]\n    ... 5 common frames omitted\n\n```\n\nKill did not work.\n\n```\n$ ./bin/local-fluo kill-worker\nUsage: grep [OPTION]...

I will create a separate follow-up issue to upgrade Accumulo and fix any failing ITs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/91335744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/91348872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/472#issuecomment-91348872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/472","id":91348872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMzQ4ODcy","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-09T20:33:51Z","updated_at":"2015-04-09T20:33:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/91348872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/93585303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/456#issuecomment-93585303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/456","id":93585303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzNTg1MzAz","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-15T22:18:38Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T22:18:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I looked into how this currently works and found the following.\n- regular notifications are deleted when the trigger column is committed using the startTs.
