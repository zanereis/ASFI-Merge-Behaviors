I seem to be able to have cpplite and cnd coexist peacefully enough for development by disabling one or the other module, but I'm pretty clueless.  We would probably not want to release netbeans with CND and cpplite at this point, but having both requiring someone to choose one to enable seems fine for development if I'm not missing some terrible side effects of this configuration.\r\n\r\n> My only concern is that if we intend to bring back cnd.navigation some day, this will be redundant. Is cnd.navigation shunned for good?\r\n\r\nI think it's important to understand that accepting this pull request is effectively pounding some nails in cnd.navigation's coffin and maybe we don't want to do that.  Not understanding why it was mothballed leaves me unsure of the path forward for bringing back features the cnd modules that now live in contrib provide.  There are lots of alternatives to what I did in this pull request which is akin to haphazardly copy/pasting the feature from cnd.navigation into the somewhat arbitrary cnd.editor module.\r\n\r\nHere are two other things that are important enough to me that I'd like to try to do something about them soon-ish (there are many other useful features in contrib/cnd.*):\r\n* the 'Go to Declaration/Implementation' feature provided by cnd.completion\r\n* cnd.discovery is needed to create a new \"C/C++ Project with Existing Sources\".\r\n  * The current state of this feature in cnd is broken.  The wizard fails because the DiscoveryExtension class in cnd.discovery is a service provider for the IteratorExtension.class that is needed to finalize/save the project.  cnd.discovery needs cnd/cnd.discovery/external/cnd-build-trace-1.0.zip native binaries as noted in [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5486).  Based on the disposition of that ticket, I assume that's hopeless effectively killing cnd.discovery.  Do we need to devise some simpler alternative  to the vast array of complex capabilities cnd.discovery has for creating a C/C++ project from existing sources?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1752385281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1753223769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5024#issuecomment-1753223769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5024","id":1753223769,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ogBJZ","user":{"login":"TheMarvelFan","id":93257324,"node_id":"U_kgDOBY7-bA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93257324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan","html_url":"https://github.com/TheMarvelFan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheMarvelFan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-09T15:25:52Z","updated_at":"2023-10-09T15:25:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi I have opened a pull request referencing this issue, but I require some guidance.
