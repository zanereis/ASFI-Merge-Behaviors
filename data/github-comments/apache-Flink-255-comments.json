A short checkpoint time that whether lead to poor compression or not, I will give an actual production test under compression situation and as an attachment attached to [FLINK-9407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-9407) in the next few days.\r\n\r\nActually, We having been using this PR (but not polished yet) in our production environment for a long time. And getting a very nice results ending that compared to spark streaming. I will put the test results in the form of attachments to [FLINK-9407](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-9407) as a reference. And what you are more concerned about the short checkpoint interval will lead to poor compression, yea I would agree but we need a test for it. **Furthermore, we have all known that the longer snapshots interval, the lower performance impact of asynchronous or synchronous snapshotting we would get. So, I do not think people  inclined to adopt short checkpoint intervals for getting a high throughput and low latency in most cases**. For example, in our calculation of uv jobs, the checkpoint intervals is 30 seconds. Anyway, I will still give a test results under the compression situation.\r\n\r\nI suggest this PR can merge as a temporary solution to reduce the user's learning curve since some users already had used ```BucketingSink``` in their project and wants this functionality as we can see in the user mail list a few days ago.  And In a short time, they may not switch to a new sink ```StreamingFileSink ``` . This may be one of the good reasons I think.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I will watch  [FLINK-9749](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-9749) and the subtask   [FLINK-9753](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-9753) soon and give more response in the next couple of days.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403016062/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403016425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6271#issuecomment-403016425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6271","id":403016425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzAxNjQyNQ==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T12:14:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T12:14:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/403016425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
