thanks for the quick update. I agree that using the already generated and compiled code whenever possible would be very good in the long run. Also, I agree with the step-by-step refactoring approach. With respect to this PR, I propose to extract the ```VectorState``` into a separate class together with all the ```ProjectRecordBatch```'s fields that can be encapsulated. I believe that the extraction of ```VectorState``` won't allow using mixed access to fields in the future and opens more ways for later improvements.

I believe I've addressed your comments. Please take another look.\r\n\r\nThis commit contains some significant changes. As it turns out, we have three different ways we work with Union vectors in code gen. Two worked, the third did not. Figuring that out was a bit of an involved exercise. I added quite a few comments and split up some overly-large methods, to help gain understanding. I added a bit of a hack to work around the missing case. It works; all tests pass including the new one that initially failed. (And DRILL-7510 got magically fixed along the way.)\r\n\r\nI say the fix is a \"hack\" because I had to add more state: to access the Union vector when setting up parameters that use a `FieldReader`. It seems there should be a simpler way; but I could not find it.\r\n\r\n@KazydubB, these changes touched some of the same areas you apparently touched for your `DICT` work. Can you take a look to 1) make sure I didn't accidentally break anything, and 2) perhaps see the pattern I may be missing about how to set up a `FieldReader` for a Union vector.

In normal SQL, there is just one level of type: a columns is an `INT` or a `DOUBLE`.\r\n\r\nIn Sqllite (IIRC) there is the `Variant` type: so a column can be `Variant` but the values can be `INT` or `DOUBLE`. The \"variant\" name comes from Visual Basic. In Drill, the variant is called `UNION`.\r\n\r\nIn Drill, we also have structured types: `ARRAY<INTEGER>` or `DICT<STRING,DOUBLE>`.\r\n\r\nWe've been trying to handle all these cases with originally one function (`typeof()`), then later three (adding `sqlTypeOf()` and `drillTypeOf()`).\r\n\r\nWe probably want four variations. Two forms of the type:\r\n\r\n* The full type description: `ARRAY<ARRAY<MAP<a: INTEGER, b: VARCHAR>>>` say, or `UNION<DOUBLE, INTEGER>`.\r\n* The short type of the vector itself: `LIST`, `UNION`.\r\n\r\nFor Variant types (`UNION`, `LIST`) we then want two forms:\r\n\r\n* The vector itself. (`DICT`, `MAP`, `UNION`, `LIST`)\r\n* The value: (`INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`).\r\n\r\nOf course, the value can itself be structured: a `UNION` which has a `LIST` of `UNION` types. So, for both the vector and the value, we'd want both the simple and verbose forms.\r\n\r\nAnd, now that @arina-ielchiieva added the nice type description system, we have no function which returns the full description, including the `NOT NULL` attribute, as it appears in the schema file: `INTEGER NOT NULL`.\r\n\r\nThe present fix gets us closer, but it is hard to solve four or five cases with three functions. I suspect we could do better.

Then I thought better of it. You'll notice that, at present, it is kind of a \"shim\" class to expose certain operations on the vector objects to the \"materializer\" without making the entire project operator visible. In particular, it is an inner class so it can tinker with project operator state.\r\n\r\nWe could accomplish the same thing by defining an interface which `ProjectRecordBatch` would implement. But, in that case, all the complex setup logic would be back in the project operator, undoing the separation we just accomplished. So, the interface approach feels not quite right.\r\n\r\nI agree that this can be improved, but I don't yet see an obvious move that leaves the code simpler. So, I thought to just leave it as is for now.\r\n\r\nMaybe it can evolve to own the allocation vectors, complex writers and so on. These are the kinds of questions we can ask now that we can start to see the pieces rather than just a big mess.

In working on another issue, it slowly dawned on me a couple of other worthwhile goals in addition to those mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned above that CD combines logical planning and code gen, creating a very complex bit of code. Again, some of us are not smart enough to be able to quickly understand the combined logic, so it would make sense to separate out the two steps so that average folks can more easily understand and modify them.\r\n\r\nThen, we need to think about debug and testing. As originally implemented, CG was direct path from operator to running byte codes. The original authors were smart enough to be able to debug the result by stepping through the compiled byte codes. Most of us are not that smart. So,  few years back we added the \"plain Java\" and \"save code for debugging\" modes which made it possible for us newbies to view and step through the Java code.\r\n\r\nStill, in order to debug, we need to run Drill, find a useful unit test, run the query, and then debug CG in the context of running a query. We are limited in what we can test based on what queries we can find or create to set up the scenarios of interest.\r\n\r\nBetter would be to apply unit testing principles: separate out CG so we can set up a set of inputs, run CG, and diff the resulting code against a golden copy. This is how we debugged the Impala planner and it worked very well. This way, we can easily set up every data type without needing to use a zillion different input file formats. That is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(operator config, schema, options) --> CG --> (Java code, exec plan)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the \"exec plan\" would be things like the knick-lacks that the `VectorState` currently wrap. That is, rather than having CG set up vectors, maybe CG creates a plan that says, \"here are the vectors you will need\", then the operator creates the vectors. Still pretty hand-wavey at this point.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring can be seen as a naive grasping toward that goal. We need to pull out CG, but it is not clear yet the final form. The same can be said of the earlier refactoring of the external sort to separate out CG. Sometimes, just by taking a step, we can get a bit better understanding of where we need to go.\r\n\r\nAll that said, the goal here is just to take a step, not to implement a final solution. I realize, however, that makes this PR hard to review since it is incomplete: it takes a step, but does not clearly state \"a step to where?\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/571241220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/571324793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1941#issuecomment-571324793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1941","id":571324793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTMyNDc5Mw==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T21:35:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T21:35:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KazydubB Thanks for catching that.

This version still uses the interface, with an implementation in a class other than the project record batch. This turns out to be handy because, oddly, the project operator generates code for two separate incoming batches: the \"real\" one and a \"fake\" empty one. The `ProjectRecordBatchBuilder` holds onto the input batch so we don't have to pass it into the materializer and back out.\r\n\r\nThis version tries to eliminate all references to the incoming batch in the materializer, and instead work with the batch schema. Annoyingly, the `ExpressionTreeMaterializer` needs the input batch so it can iterate over the vectors to get their schemas. If all we need is the schema, we don't need actual vectors. So, if we can pass in a schema, we can completely separate code gen from physical vectors.\r\n\r\nThe next refactoring move is to change this code to work with a schema (or interface to obtain the schema) rather than the actual vectors. Now, as it turns out, the batch schema has limitations for complex types, which is one of the reasons we created the `TupleMetadata` family of classes. So, perhaps we can convert the incoming batch to a `TupleMetadata` schema and use that. (The code to do that already exists in the `RowSet` classes.)\r\n\r\nOr, we can just pass an interface which will return the `TypedFieldId` for each column. Or, do that conversion ahead of time, and pass in the results. Will have to play with it some to see which solution is the simplest.\r\n\r\nSince the required work will be rather large; I propose we do that as a separate PR.\r\n\r\nHave we done enough for this

@arina-ielchiieva \r\nI fixed the issues you raised.   I went through all the warnings in IntelliJ and addressed all the relevant ones.  Just FYI, I did do this earlier in the review process, but it recommended some changes that didn't seem to pass review.  For instance, changing a lot of the functions to package private.  In any event, I removed almost all of the warnings.  (There are two remaining in the batch reader relating to reworking a for loop, but those did not work well, so I'm leaving them.) \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to write a generic matrix transpose method for java primitives.  It's easy enough to write, but I don't think there's a way to do it in a generic manner.  If anyone can show me how to do that, I'm all ears.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help and patience with this.  As you know, this isn't my full time job and this particular plugin is really complicated.
