There is already some work done, but I =\npersonally don=E2=80=99t have the full overview about the current status =\nof the CMake support, so you may ask for the details on the mailing list =\nif such becomes necessary.

The ThriftTest is designed to validate cross-language and =\ncross-platform compatibility in a standardized manner.

This has evolved over time, and the current consensus and =\nrule-of-thumb is this:\n\n```\n(a) the ThriftTest integration test should be placed under =\n```\n\n/test/<lang>\n    (b) any other, especially language-specific tests, should be placed =\nunder /lib/<lang>/test=20\nyet.

My changes =\nto build files resulted from looking for usages of `as3`, and adding =\nDart support where it seemed appropriate.  I may have missed something =\nhere?\n\n2) I can move the .gitignore entries for Dart to the main file.  I added =\na local file to avoid unintentional side-effects with other languages, =\nby ignoring `packages`, for instance.  But it looks like it should be =\nfine to move it to the root file.\n\n3) That's correct, we have not implemented the ThriftTest integration =\ntest yet.  We can work on this - it looks like the php implementation is =\npretty straightforward, so I might start from that.  Like the php test, =\nthe Dart would only test the client, since we don't plan to implement a =\nfull Dart Thrift server implementation yet.  Of course someone else =\ncould add this later, but using Dart for a server is far less common.\n\nThank you for looking at the Dart PR.

These endless boolean args lists deserve to be eliminated, that's for sure. \nBut why do we replace them by named constants/enum values? Is this\n\n```\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &fkey, true /* declare */, \"\", NOT_IN_CLASS, NO_COERCE_DATA, NOT_IN_KEY);\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &fval, true /* declare */, \"\", NOT_IN_CLASS, NO_COERCE_DATA, NOT_IN_KEY, IN_CONTAINER);\n```\n\nreally better than this?\n\n```\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &fkey, true, \"\", false, false, true);\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &fval, true, \"\", false, false, false, true);\n```\n\nWhy not do this instead?\n\n```\nvoid generate_deserialize_field(ofstream& out, t_field* tfield, string prefix, FLAGS flags) { \n    ...\n}\n```\n\nand call it like \n\n```\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &fval, \"\", DECLARE_FIELD | IN_CONTAINER);\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &fval, \"\", DECLARE_FIELD | IN_CLASS | COERCE_DATA | IN_KEY | IN_CONTAINER);\n```\n\nThe second example is a bit constructed, but you get the idea. All `NO_XXX`s can be omitted because they are `0`, therefore only the flags set need to be specified.  I agree that there would be two drawbacks: one is the limitation to 32 (maybe 64) bits, which at least has the potential to become an issue later on; the other is that we lose type safety again - but we only have one `flags` argument, hence not many chances to mix things up.\n\nAnother approach I frequently use is passing a struct containing all the args. These can be allocated on the stack and are usually quite cheap. The called routine gets a const ref or ptr->const which is also cheap.\n\nLast not least ... would be awesome to have a similar solution in all the other generators as well. Functions with more than five args are a code smell, and we have plenty of them. \n\nAs always, other opinions are welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/143038915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/143065168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/624#issuecomment-143065168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/624","id":143065168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzA2NTE2OA==","user":{"login":"prashantv","id":140159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDE1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv","html_url":"https://github.com/prashantv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T22:21:29Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T22:21:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the feedback - I was thinking about a struct approach, but because it's not easy to create a struct inline, I avoided that.\n\nAs you said, flags work, but lose type safety - there's no way to say that `COERCE_DATA` is not a valid argument for `type_to_go_type`. I think it's better to have type safety.\n\nIf you think the struct approach is better, we can do that, although calls will then probably look like:\n\n``` cpp\nDeserializeFieldOpts opts\nopts.UseTrueType = true;\nopts.InContainer = true;\ngenerate_deserialize_field(out, &felem, true, \"\", opts);\n```\n\nI think once we decide on an approach, it should be consistently applied for the other compilers.

Yes, in objc selectors are separate from the classes - they're shared between them and stored as plain strings. That creates problems only when you're dealing with `id` objects - compiler doesn't have type information. When you call method on `id` compiler will search for any class that contains the selector. But if your variable have a specific type then compiler will know what to do. Even with `id` I don't remember any conflicts - compiler just silently lets me call any selector that it can find which may crash at runtime because that particular object doesn't implement it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/147547155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/147554481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/539#issuecomment-147554481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/539","id":147554481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzU1NDQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"jriskin","id":308135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/308135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin","html_url":"https://github.com/jriskin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jriskin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T00:19:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T00:19:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@creker ah, that makes some sense, I am using id for a couple of types of objects that I store in arrays and they don't resolve to a type until runtime.
