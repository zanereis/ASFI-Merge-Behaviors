We could simplify the code base by supporting a single configuration system. That will bring some benefits like:\r\n\r\n- If users want to set up a batch or all agents, they could set up a CR.\r\n- If users have to debug a deployment, they could leverage annotation to override some items defined in CR. \r\n\r\nThe controller onboarding will create a default CR. Users have a chance to modify it later. And the most critical is **to determine the precedence** between CRs once they match the same agents.
