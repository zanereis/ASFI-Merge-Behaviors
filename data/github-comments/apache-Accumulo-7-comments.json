When it finds them, it tries to load the class, using Class.forName. Since the classloader is the VFSClassLoader and the files are in HDFS, it uses the DFS client code to retrieve the associated object. The DFS client, in another thread, is performing RPC calls to retrieve the object. During the processing of a response (1st call stack in the JIRA), it attempts to load some classes, using Class.forName. Class.forName acquires a lock on the ClassLoader, which is the root of the problem. The solution here is to attempt to preload the classes that the DFS Client is going to load.\n\nI will clean up the code, address the findbugs issues, and try to backport to 1.7.2

This will again cause imbalance, as the \"new\" tserver will have approximately double it's expected load, causing yet more round(s) of balancing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/228752556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/228833453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/121#issuecomment-228833453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/121","id":228833453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODgzMzQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T18:30:21Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T18:30:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> If the tablet server returns before master notices it's gone, master will see it as a new empty tablet server. \n\nOne possible beginning of solution is to change the behavior of `Master.gatherTabletInformation()` to do the following :\n- Check if the instance matches the tablet server its talking to get status.  This could be done by adding the instance id to the returned Thrift struct.\n- If the instance id does not match, then add tserver to `badServers`.

I looked at how the current code works and it attempts to prevent this.

The `current` map key is based on the zookeeper lock name which is host+port as set on [TabletServer line

How will this patch handle that case?\n\nThis patch won't handle such a case at all.  I'm sure it shows my inexperience with Accumulo, but I was unaware of this script.  I'm more familiar with engineering and dealing with [crash-only software](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/candea/candea.pdf).  I had assumed that a tserver would be stopped by SIGTERM or SIGKILL.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on how to handle this use case.  My current thought would be to make unloading a tablet this way suspend the tablet instead of unassigning it.  I.e. in `tserver.TabletServer.UnloadTabletHandler.run()` at line 2012, call `TabletStateStore.suspend(...)` instead of `TabletStateStore.unassign(...)`.\n\n> When a tablet server is suspended, all queries will block right?\n\nWhen a _tablet_ is suspended, all queries against that tablet do seem to block (or possibly time out).\n\n> I see you are suspending the metadata tablets too.\n\nBy default, metadata tablets won't be suspended, even if the metadata table (or global configuration) has `tablet.suspend.duration` set.  One must also set the option `master.metadata.suspendable` to true (default false). The check for this is handled at Master.java:1154. \n\nNote to self: Looking back at that code, I realize that this check is made only once (at startup), instead of rechecking for updated configuration.  Should probably make that check repeatedly.\n\n> I see you are storing the host and port in the metadata for a suspended tablet. Sometimes we have tservers come up with a different host or port. In that case, I guess the tablets will wait until the suspend duration to be reassigned.\n\nThis is correct.  Tablet suspension is essentially incompatible with dynamic port assignment.  Of course, this wouldn't be the only part of Accumulo to suffer under random/dynamic port assignment.  Specifying `tserv.port.client==0` or `tserv.port.search==true` breaks assumptions in other places too.  Some I know of:\n- I decided to match host+port based on code in `server.master.balance.DefaultLoadBalancer.getAssignment()`.  That code uses host+port to match a tablet's `last` column, for preserving locality.  If the tserver's port changes, the `last` column is effectively ignored, reducing locality.\n- Having walked the logic path for `stop-here.sh`, my read is that `server.util.Admin.stopTabletServer(...)` (used by stop-here.sh) assumes tserver(s) on the specified  host (resp. localhost) will be on port(s) specified by `tserv.port.client`.  Hence, running a tserver with `tserv.port.client`==0 will render `Admin.stopTabletServer(...)` ineffective, and `stop-here.sh` will fall back to sending SIGTERM/SIGKILL to stop the tserver.  Similarly, running a tserver with `tserv.port.search==true` risks the same behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/230501224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/230964855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/122#issuecomment-230964855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/122","id":230964855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDk2NDg1NQ==","user":{"login":"dhutchis","id":1687158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T02:43:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T02:43:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/230964855/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/231082284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/121#issuecomment-231082284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/121","id":231082284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTA4MjI4NA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T13:47:26Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T13:47:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> My current thought would be to make unloading a tablet this way suspend the tablet instead of unassigning\n\nI took a quick look and it seemed a tserver did not know why it was unloading.

So in my most recent push, I modified the the thrift method `TabletClientService.unloadTablet(...)`.  Whereas it used to take a `boolean save` parameter, I instead have it take an enumerated value describing the desired end state of the tablet:\n- UNASSIGNED: Upon unloading, leave the tablet in the UNASSIGNED state.\n- SUSPENDED: Upon unloading, leave the tablet in the SUSPENDED state.\n- DELETED: Upon unloading, leave the tablet in the UNASSIGNED state.
