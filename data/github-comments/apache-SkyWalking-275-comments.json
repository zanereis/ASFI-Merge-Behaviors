When I add skywalking to our app then firebase breaks and complains of cors errors. The only thing I can sugguest is the way Skywalking is handling the XHR requests in modifying something that google is looking for in the http headers and is being blocked (some security setting) \r\n\r\n\r\nDoes skywalking client respect the nosniff header of the HTTP request or does it intercept all requests.  I wont be able to do any more tests until Monday now but would appreciate it if you would setup a demo on your side and test with firebase as im confident this is a skywalking issue.

It is not SkyWalking's special requirement, it is from HTTPS.\r\n> \r\n> CORS is all working for both skywalking and the app, what I don't understand is when dont have skywalking register method in the app our firebase works well and has no issues. When I add skywalking to our app then firebase breaks and complains of cors errors. The only thing I can sugguest is the way Skywalking is handling the XHR requests in modifying something that google is looking for in the http headers and is being blocked (some security setting)\r\n> \r\n> Does skywalking client respect the nosniff header of the HTTP request or does it intercept all requests.

I noticed your requests aren't simple requests, so the requests would trigger a [CORS preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request). The preflight request  is a [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/http/cors#examples_of_access_control_scenarios) request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood and a server is aware using specific methods and headers.\r\nWhen the `skywalking-client-js` set trace parameters in your app requests header, the preflight request status code is 403. As your preflight requests are fail, CORS happened here.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, your server don't allow you to customize parameter in the http header and you should resolve this problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1100018652/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1100021718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/8877#issuecomment-1100021718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/8877","id":1100021718,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85BkP_W","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-15T10:21:10Z","updated_at":"2022-04-15T10:21:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Fine0830  I think this may be caused by 3rd party SAAS services, like Google's, they put some rules about this for security, and out of users' control.
