To make it happen I would have to modify the generated thrift code, which really is a non-starter, but thinking about this I think I have a way to still do it.  I should be able to borrow code from the maven shade plugin, and shade the submitted jar to translate backtype.storm -> org.apache.storm and storm.trident -> org.apache.storm.trident.  This code would exist in a separate jar and would be a plugin that could be configured on for those that want it, and off for those that don't.
