It looks like you can create a validator class that is called when `parse` is called and JCommander provides you with all of the arguments. I'm thinking of the following case:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Create a class called `HelpRequestedParameterException` that extends `ParameterException`\r\n> 2. Create a class that implements `IParametersValidator` that throws `HelpRequestedParameterException` if any of the keys in the parameter map are `-h`, `--help`, or `-?`.\r\n> 3. Add the validator class to all of the `@Parameters` annotations.\r\n> 4. Wrap the call to `JCommander.parse()` so that it traps `HelpRequestedParameterException` to display the help.\r\n\r\nThis seemed like a really neat way to handle the help param so I spent some time throwing it together. \r\nHowever it doesn't work as Jcommander's parse first attempts to verify that each arg is a valid option and fails if it's not. \r\nSo if `help` isn't added to the sub command's opt string then it fails out. \r\n\r\nSpecifically it attempts to parse the main param on line 819 before attempting the validators on line 822: https://github.com/cbeust/jcommander/blob/8ab73fd92c8ca25bd9358e8e6445ad9bff851747/src/main/java/com/beust/jcommander/JCommander.java#L819","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2587369193/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2587500584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5220#issuecomment-2587500584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5220","id":2587500584,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6aOiAo","user":{"login":"ddanielr","id":12480877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDgwODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12480877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr","html_url":"https://github.com/ddanielr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-13T15:52:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-13T15:52:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > just curious if my comment about global parameter validation was seen.

I can avoid that test failing for now, but it may still be a problem. If there's still an issue, it will be easier to track down after refactoring the locator cache code to no longer use the static singleton. It is the last remaining static singleton that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\nHowever, even after removing the static singleton, it's still possible that the ZooSession whose lifecycle is bounded by the lifecycle of the context (ServerContext or AccumuloClient/ClientContext) can leak out into thread pools that outlive the context, so we should continue to take care to avoid that and to bind those thread pools to the context and shut them down properly when the context is

fate code in 4.0 will run as many steps as possible in a fate op as long as isReady keeps returning zero.  The code in 3.1 and 2.1 will only run a single step at a time and switch to something else even if the next step isReady.  \r\n\r\nSince this test has a single fate thread for the case of when 0 is always returned for isReady then it should never interleave.  For the case where isReady returns non zero it should interleave if possible, but it is not guaranteed to happen in the strict way this test is looking for.  I ran the test and saw a situation like the following happen.\r\n\r\n 1. Test thread adds Fate1\r\n 2. Test thread adds Fate2\r\n 3. Fate threads looks for work, sees Fate1 and Fate2 and run their isReady methods.  So the clock is already counting down on those.\r\n 4. Test thread adds Fate3\r\n 5. Fate threads looks for work and sees Fate1,Fate2,Fate3.\r\n\r\nIn the above situation the fact that the fate threads saw some of the work before all of the work was added throws off what the test is looking for.  Another thing that I saw throw off the test was fate operations taking longer than they slept for.  For example the isReady method sleeps for 50ms, but it could actually take 400ms to run which has a cascading impact on the expectations of the test.\r\n\r\nI think the test is trying to ensure that when isReady returns non zero that fate does switch to work other things.  However the way its doing it is to strict so it does seem good to relax it.   Since this test is dealing w/ multithreading something like the following could happen (although it has a really low probability).\r\n\r\n 1. Test thread adds Fate1\r\n 2. Fate threads runs Fate1 through all of its steps.\r\n 3. Test threads adds Fate2\r\n 4. Fate threads runs Fate2 through all of its steps\r\n 5. Test threads adds Fate3\r\n 6. Fate threads runs Fate3 through all of its steps\r\n\r\nIn this example if the test thread is running really slowly and fate threads are running fast then no interleaving would happen and that would not indicate a bug in the code.  This could happen on an overloaded test server.\r\n\r\nMaybe for the interleaving test the Fate.isReady calls could only return 0 when its seen the other two have executed isReady.  Like Fate1 step1 would only return 0 for is ready if its seen Fate2 and Fate3 have run isReady.  Then if the code was not switching between fate ops that were returning non-zero of isReady the test wold get stuck forever.  That may be overkill though, changing the test look for some interleaving is probably good.  Normally some interleaving will happen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2594024061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2595827662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5214#issuecomment-2595827662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5214","id":2595827662,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6auS_O","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T14:09:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T14:09:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wonder if the best solution here is to remove FateInterleavingIT in main and close #5223 (backport to 3.1).

If fate called Repo.call after Repo.isReady returned non zero it would be nice to catch that bug and the changes in this test would have  chance of doing that.  So testing the following is good and  the changes in this PR are doing that with the comparisons to the new `expRunOrder` list. \r\n\r\n 1. Fate should call Repo.isReady as long it returns non zero\r\n 2. Fate should always call Repo.isReady at least once before Repo.call\r\n 3. Only when Fate sees zero returned by Repo.isReady it should execute Repo.call.\r\n\r\nTesting not interleaving and interleaving is also nice.  However, only the not interleaving case can be tested deterministically in 4.0. For the case where isReady always returns zero we should never see interleaving and we should see things happen in the expected order per fate op.  For the case were isReady is returning non-zero the fate threads should switch to work on something else, but that may not be observed because of timing issues. So maybe  we should test execution order and non interleaving and chuck the interleaving test.

I personally think it would be best to keep FateInterleavingIT. It is testing an aspect of FATE that is otherwise not tested. Since the FATE code has since changed to no longer adhere to the strict constraints this test originally assumed, we should just update the test like in this PR, not remove the test entirely. FATE should still be interleaving at least sometimes when isReady returns > 0 and FATE should be executing the operations in the correct order per fateop, interleaving or not. We would lose this functionality check if this test is removed.\r\n3) Should we remove the interleaving test keeping the non-interleaving test? I think we should still be testing this. In this PR, we just ensure an interleave occurs at least once. This is highly unlikely to fail (and we can decrease the likelihood of failure even more by running this test with more FateIds if we want). Seeing a test failure for this would much more likely mean that something is wrong with the functionality of FATE, which we would lose if we don't test this case. We could also go with the solution Keith proposed [here](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5214#issuecomment-2594024061) for the interleaving test.\r\n4) Rename the test? I think renaming the test to FateExecutionOrderIT is a good idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2596431631/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2596536391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4380#issuecomment-2596536391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4380","id":2596536391,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6axABH","user":{"login":"DomGarguilo","id":47725857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI1ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47725857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo","html_url":"https://github.com/DomGarguilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T19:01:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T19:01:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This PR has been updated to use the new Timer object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2596536391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2596717055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5263#issuecomment-2596717055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5263","id":2596717055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6axsH_","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T19:39:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T19:39:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Another potential solution to this problem is disallowing decreasing the pool size, but I'm not sure if that's the way we want to go about this.\r\n\r\nI agree that is not a good way to go.

I refactored the code to use the copy constructor instead of deepCopy to keep in line with the API.

It represents the type of fate operation being performed. For example, if a table is created, this would be a TABLE_CREATE fate operation. `TxName`, `txName`, or similar were used throughout the code to represent this previously String type. This is no longer the best way to represent what is being stored or passed around now. `fateOp` may be the best way to represent this now.

The following is a half baked idea that is trying to reconcile these things in the code, in this model there are two objects.  \r\n\r\n```java\r\n   // This contains all of the current ZooCache code, but it uses ZooKeeper directly instead of ZooSession.  \r\n   // Instances of this class use a single zookeeper object for their lifetime (so the Zookeeper obj could be \r\n   // final).  Also the set of watched paths could be final and immutable.\r\nclass ZooCacheDirect {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// All code in Accumulo uses this for caching zookeeper reads\r\nclass ZooCache {\r\n   // All reads are proxied to the internal zoo cache w/ reconnect handling that will create an new internal\r\n   //  zoocachedirect as needed.\r\n   AtomicReference<ZooCacheDirect> internalZooCache;\r\n   \r\n   // However w/ this model it seems that ZooCache has to duplicate some of the retry logic in ZooSession?  Could this be refactored?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNot really sure about the above.  Its an attempt to move the zoocache code to having a 1:1 relationship w/ a zookeeper object in its internals because this may simplify its impl and simplify reasoning abouts its correctness.  However unsure how the retry logic plays out in this model and if it duplicates zoosession code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2605433098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2605466395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5256#issuecomment-2605466395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5256","id":2605466395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6bTEMb","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-21T18:32:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T18:32:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wonder if it would make more sense to have a `ZooSession.getCache` method.

Is there a reason not to include an interleaving test in 3.1?

We are good? I think the test in 3.1 is good as-is, as it tests the fate execution order in 3.1. The fate execution order in 4.0 is different. But in both branches, even though the order is different, there is only one way it works. The reason that the test name in 3.1 is `testDefaultInterleaving` is because I copied this from a test in PR where I was trying to create two ways Fate execution order could work. I will put up a PR for 3.1 that just changes the name of the test method to remove any confusion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2610275326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2610305425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5214#issuecomment-2610305425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5214","id":2610305425,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6blhmR","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-23T16:25:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T16:25:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kevinrr888 - test method rename in #5280 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2610305425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2610336916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/5214#issuecomment-2610336916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/5214","id":2610336916,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6blpSU","user":{"login":"kevinrr888","id":43969518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTY5NTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43969518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinrr888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinrr888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-23T16:34:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T16:34:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes all good.

So maybe creating another flag that becomes `true` when `reset()` is called in the `LocalityGroupReader` so that when `next()` or `seek()` is called, we can check this flag and immediately throw an Exception. I don't think this would fix the problem you were seeing but might make things more evident in the calling code. \n\nI am not very familiar with this code.
