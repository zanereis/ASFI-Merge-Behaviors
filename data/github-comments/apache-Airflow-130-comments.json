There are a few ways to change it.\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/config-setting.html\r\nFirst is using postgresql.conf file setting in the data directory on Postgres server. If you don't have server access, or don't want to make a global setting that will affect all queries then don't use this.\r\n\r\nYou can also set it in your session using something like (in milliseconds)\r\n`set statement_timeout to 100000`\r\nYou could add that at the beginning of your SQL query being passed in the `sql` parameter for the `PostgresToGoogleCloudStorageOperator` and see if that works. \r\n\r\nTo set it as environment variable on the client:\r\nhttps://dba.stackexchange.com/a/1376/10866\r\nYou could set that permanently on the Airflow server, probably a good option.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also an `options` parameter available in the psycopg python package that Airflow uses for connections to Postgres. `options` will pass through any of a range of command line parameters to Postgres. \r\nThe syntax _would_ be something like this:\r\noptions='-c statement_timeout=100000'\r\nUnfortunately the PostgresHook doesn't allow for this parameter. The only options are the ones in conn_args, and certain extra ones allowed in the conn.extra field, including keepalives_idle . see:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/hooks/postgres_hook.py#L41\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you could modify the hook to allow for `statement_timeout` in the conn.extra field. You could do it as a plugin for both the hook & operator, or fork, patch and contribute a pull request. I recommend creating a separate Jira ticket and issue for this, as it doesn't relate to this thread.\r\nAllowing options could be useful for other parameters too, but of course your Postgres user would have to have appropriate permission to set them.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, keepalives_idle has nothing to do with your statement_timeout issue.

Your current code isn't fully in line with the design of Airflow. You should get the ip and port form the connection. Like:\r\n```\r\nconn = self.get_connection(self.redis_conn_id)\r\nself.host = conn.host\r\nself.port = int(conn.port)\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/hooks/redis_hook.py\r\n\r\nThe dependency should be added to the `setup.py` in the root.\r\n\r\nI would like to see mocking these calls: `self.nomad_client.job.get_allocations(job_id)`. These calls should be mocked so you get an example response, and some edge cases. What will happen if the job doesn't exists, or if the connection to Nomad times out.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, if there are any further questions, please let me know. \r\n\r\nCheers,
