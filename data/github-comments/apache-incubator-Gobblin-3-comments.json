per conversation with Chavdar. I have removed the `increment(Object record)` from the `Watermark` interface. It is now up to the `Extractor` class to update the `Watermark`. I have also removed the Jackson based serialization of the `Watermark` class and have just added `toJson` and `initFromJson` methods to the `Watermark` interface. Jackson is not that efficient, and can be messy to deal with, so its best use a simpler serialization approach.\n\nSo now the expected e2e flow is as follows:\n\n1: The `Source` class creates a series of `WorkUnit`s, each `WorkUnit` contains a `WatermarkInterval`. The `WatermarkInterval` contains a low watermark, expected high watermark, and an actual high watermark. It is possible that a `WorkUnit` is not always able to pull data from its low watermark, to its high watermark. Take Camus for example, where map tasks only pull data for a (topic, partition) for \"x\" amount of time, and then move on to the next (topic, partition).\n\n2: Each `WorkUnit` is then serialized into a SequenceFile\n\n3: Each map task reads a series of `WorkUnit`s from this sequence file, and de-serializes them. It then executes these `WorkUnit`s.\n\n4: The `Extractor` class is responsible for maintaining the following invariant. After each call to `readRecord()` the `Watermark` returned by `getCurrentHighWatermark` should cover all records up to and including the last record returned by `readRecord()`. This method may be called multiple times in order to report the % completion of the `WorkUnit`.\n\nThe following questions are still open:\n\n1: I have added a new method to `Extractor` which is causing a lot of other classes to break\n\n2: In order to avoid another state-store migration, I have added a hack to serialize the WatermarkInterval class. Should be discuss migrating away from SequenceFile formats?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/98916649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/99163277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/121#issuecomment-99163277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/121","id":99163277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MTYzMjc3","user":{"login":"liyinan926","id":3709137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinan926","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T18:10:51Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T18:10:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wants to share some of my thoughts on the `Watermark` and `WatermarkInterval` classes:\n1. `Watermark` should be generic with a type parameter and a method `public T getValue()`. \n2. `WatermarkInterval` should be immutable and only contain two things, the low and high `Watermark`s.

Regardless of whether `Watermark` is generic or not, you still need to put some type of value into your `MyWatermark` class. With generic, the only additional thing you need to do is to specify explicitly what is the type of that value. The benefits are you allow the compiler to enforce type checking, which is always better than using `Object`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/99178921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/99181844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/121#issuecomment-99181844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/121","id":99181844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MTgxODQ0","user":{"login":"liyinan926","id":3709137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinan926","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T18:57:18Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T18:57:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's good to have a common method like `getValue` so it is able to get the value of a `Watermark` as long as it has access to the interface.

Major changes are:\n1. The way cancellation is handled. `AbstractJobLauncher` now has a default implementation of `cancelJob` that simply sets the flag `cancellationRequested` (which is `volatile boolean`), which indicates that cancellation is requested. Then the method will `wait` (with timeout) on a object named `cancellationLock` on which `notify` will be called once the cancellation is successfully executed. No explicit synchronization is needed for `cancellationRequested` since it is `volatile boolean`. The responsibility of executing the cancellation is done in the `runWorkUnits` method of the implementation classes of `JobLauncher`. In `MRJobLauncher`, `runWorkUnits` will periodically check if the flag `cancellationRequested` is set, and will kill the Hadoop job if it is. In `LocalJobLauncher`, `runWorkUnits` will also periodically check if the flag `cancellationRequested` is set, and will drain the `CountDownLatch` if it is.\n2. Added a new class `JobContext` that contains all context information of a job. This simplifies `AbstractJobLauncher`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/99625017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/99655155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/121#issuecomment-99655155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/121","id":99655155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5NjU1MTU1","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-07T00:19:00Z","updated_at":"2015-05-07T00:19:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chavdar I still have some questions, so maybe we can sync up.
