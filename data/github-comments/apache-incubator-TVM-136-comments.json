I like the idea of the config library concept. Some concerns/questions:\r\n\r\n- Same to @kevinthesun, I'd prefer to keep the current AutoTVM dispatch context instead of introducing a new one. For example, we can just overload `apply_history_best` to take either a JSON file like now or a config library in this proposal.\r\n\r\n- Current AutoTVM has a database module that stores tuned configs and results to Redis database (altough no one is using this feature AFAIK). Considering the compatibility and usability, we should hide the resume logic from users and make all storage mechanisms consist. For example, we can first move the \"log to\" callback to tuner arguments:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    tuner_obj.tune(\r\n\tn_trial=min(n_trial, len(tsk.config_space)),\r\n\tearly_stopping=early_stopping,\r\n\tmeasure_option=measure_option,\r\n        config_library=\"history.json\", # Can be either a string (JSON file name) or a DB object\r\n\tcallbacks=[\r\n\t    autotvm.callback.progress_bar(n_trial, prefix=prefix),\r\n\t],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can implement the resume logic you proposed in the constructor of tuners.\r\n\r\n- For the rules that determine if the history can be reused for resuming the tuning, I think it should be a general question as the tophub faces to. However, I would not suggest to refer to the tuning specific information such as trial numbers for the following reasons. First, users may require different trial numbers or different measure options. Second, this limits the history be used only for the exactly same task. If we design this resume logic in a general way, we can also extend it to tophub.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that when loading the history, in addition to checking if the history config matches the current task in terms of target, op name, shapes and attributes, we also need to check the device as you mentioned. We can try to retrieve the target device info using system call and add it to every record when dumping to file/database.\r\n \r\nIn my personal opinion, we also need to invalid the history/records when TVM has been updated, because it may result in different performance even for the same config on the same device. The simplest way is checking the timestamp. For example, we let users config an expiration time when creating a tuner:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    library_option = {\"library\": \"history.json\", \"expiration\": 1440}\r\n\r\n    tuner_obj.tune(\r\n\tn_trial=min(n_trial, len(tsk.config_space)),\r\n\tearly_stopping=early_stopping,\r\n\tmeasure_option=measure_option,\r\n        library_option=library_option, \r\n\tcallbacks=[\r\n\t    autotvm.callback.progress_bar(n_trial, prefix=prefix),\r\n\t],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, a user wants the tuner to load `history.json` and use all records generated within 1440 minutes (1 day). One advantage of using this approach is that we don't need to touch the searching part at all, but only let `Tuner.tune` bypass the measurement when the record is available already.\r\n\r\nAgain thanks for the proposal, and any of my suggestions can be adjusted/discussed if they are too overwhelming or unnecessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543970017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/543980263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3865#issuecomment-543980263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3865","id":543980263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mzk4MDI2Mw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T22:22:54Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T22:22:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks everyone.

I think it might be more of a flag problem because the following test only fail conditionally when the output type is \"(u)int32\" and output channel c is `8 < c < 256 && c % 2 == 0 && c is not power of 2`. LLVM should try to generate a VNNI instruction when one of the inputs is `int8` and the other is `uint8` and the output is `int32`.\r\n\r\nI generated the LLVM IR and experimented it here: https://godbolt.org/z/Cktm2j\r\n\r\nIt turned out the compilation would fail if you don't specify `-march`, i.e. it could be any of `-march=skylake`, `-march= cascadelake`, `-march=icelake-client, or `-march=icelake-client`. The error message would be the same as what @anijain2305 provided in the discussion forum above.  For example, I tested locally with \"llvm -mcpu=skylake\" locally, this test can pass. But I don't have llvm-8.0 and cascadelake machine with me. I would think it could work as well.\r\n\r\nI chose clang 8.0.0 and `-march=cascadelake` on godbolt, it simply passed, note clang 7.0 will not work because it doesn't support `-march=cascadelake`.  I actually checked the assembly, but I didn't see VNNI instructions there. Instead, I saw many `VPADDD`. I am not sure if it tries to use `mul` and `hadd` to achieve the same functionality (with more instructions). @anijain2305 Can you double check?\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndata = relay.var(\"data\", shape=(1, 28, 28, 128), dtype='uint8')\r\nkernel = relay.var(\"w\", shape=(3, 3, 128, 256), dtype='int8')\r\nconv = relay.nn.conv2d(data, kernel, kernel_size=(3, 3), out_dtype='int32', data_layout='NHWC', kernel_layout='HWIO')\r\n\r\nfunc = relay.Function([data, kernel], conv)\r\n\r\nwith relay.build_config(opt_level=0):\r\n    graph, lib, params = relay.build(func, 'llvm', params=None)\r\nctx = tvm.cpu(0)\r\nmodule = runtime.create(graph, lib, ctx)\r\nprint(lib.get_source())\r\nmodule.run()\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/544277531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/544286676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4161#issuecomment-544286676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4161","id":544286676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDI4NjY3Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-20T19:58:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-20T19:59:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@icemelon9 @jroesch @zhiics please help to take a look","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/544286676/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/544289889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4159#issuecomment-544289889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4159","id":544289889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDI4OTg4OQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-20T20:33:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-20T20:33:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I will just add a unit test in qnn to help us understand how we can avoid the llvm error.

@kevinthesun and @comaniac for the responses!\r\n\r\n> I'd prefer to keep the current AutoTVM dispatch context\r\n\r\nI'm not intending to replace the existing dispatch context, only provide some syntactic sugar. We could just override the `__enter__` method of ConfigLibrary to do `apply_history_best`. I think it would be more intuitive than extracting the relevant .json file and passing explicitly.\r\n\r\n> If we design this resume logic in a general way, we can also extend it to tophub.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to generalise here? As far as I can tell, TopHub doesn't store tuning history just optimal configs, so there's no way to 'resume' a TopHub tuning session. In some way we have to determine whether the existing 'tuning effort' to produce a particular config is sufficient and number of trials is the only obvious way I can think of characterising this. I'd be happy to look at any alternative implementation idea though.\r\n\r\n> We can try to retrieve the target device info using system call and add it to every record when dumping to file/database.\r\n\r\nThis would be a good start, but I think this needs to also be something a user can fully specify. For instance, we might be interesting in driver versions, memory clock speeds or even physical parameters such as board cooling. Which system calls were you considering using to determine the platform? Perhaps have a default method that relies on these calls with the ability to pass additional arbitrary info to `config_library.start_job()`?\r\n\r\n> In my personal opinion, we also need to invalid the history/records when TVM has been updated\r\n\r\nI agree with this, but maybe it can be included as part of the previous point on board configuration? In a general sense we need an idea of whether a particular config is 'compatible' with our current platform and I think it's reasonable to include TVM version as a part of this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/544433748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/544453015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4141#issuecomment-544453015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4141","id":544453015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDQ1MzAxNQ==","user":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T10:28:06Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T10:28:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Re-triggered the CI again, everything passed successfully.

I embedded my opinions with yours and leave the dispatch context for @kevinthesun.\r\n\r\nAlso cc @tqchen and @icemelon9 for their inputs.\r\n\r\n> > If we design this resume logic in a general way, we can also extend it to tophub.\r\n> \r\n> Does it make sense to generalise here? As far as I can tell, TopHub doesn't store tuning history just optimal configs, so there's no way to 'resume' a TopHub tuning session. In some way we have to determine whether the existing 'tuning effort' to produce a particular config is sufficient and number of trials is the only obvious way I can think of characterising this. I'd be happy to look at any alternative implementation idea though.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that TopHub is serving a different purpose if we consider trial number in the resume logic, but they can still share the same implementation and history format in the way I suggested. My concern of using trial number is that it limits the use case of this RFC only for resuming interrupted tuning but not others, such as transferring the tuning process to the others, or reuse the configs of 2000 trial random search to launch a new grid search, etc.\r\n\r\nAlternativaly, we could decouple the history and a specific tuning process. Speicifically, we do not add any tuning process specific information to the config library but just let the tuner determine if it can reuse the result from the config library or not when it needs to measure that config. For example, the tuning process was interrupted in the 50th trial so we have 50 configs in the library. When resuming the tuning, the tuner still starts from scratch but it could save the time of measuring those 50 configs when the tuner follows the same tuning process. One advantage is that this scenario is applicable to different tuner or even different models with the same task.\r\n\r\nOne drawback of my alternative comapred to yours is that if the tuning process is non-deterministic (e.g., random search) then we might spend time on tuning different configs, but I think this can be workaround by either exposing an optional random seed argument in tuner (such as `random_state` used in `sklearn`), or let user reduce the trial number when resuming.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > We can try to retrieve the target device info using system call and add it to every record when dumping to file/database.\r\n> \r\n> This would be a good start, but I think this needs to also be something a user can fully specify. For instance, we might be interesting in driver versions, memory clock speeds or even physical parameters such as board cooling. Which system calls were you considering using to determine the platform? Perhaps have a default method that relies on these calls with the ability to pass additional arbitrary info to `config_library.start_job()`?\r\n> \r\n\r\nI have the same question actually.

I was proposing that only the optimal configurations be permanently saved to the config library (like with TopHub) and a temporary log file of tuning configs would be maintained only during a tuning job. Storing all of the tuning history would rapidly result in huge files which I think would be fine in the case of a database but seems unwise for text files (in terms of search performance).\r\n\r\nFrom my experience using AutoTVM, I often find interrupted tuning sessions occur while tuning a large multilayer network. In this case, I mostly care about skipping the layers that have already been fully tuned. Restarting the partially tuned layer from scratch is often not a significant time penalty in comparison. I see that this approach is not nearly as good in a workflow that involves iteratively tuning a network more and more, in which case you would save a significant amount of time by being able to resume using the tuning history.\r\n\r\nA compromise between the two options might be, as you said, making the tuners deterministic. That way by just knowing the number of trials we can determine which configs can be skipped without needing to store the entire history.

According to your reply, are you going to store the best config for each layer only? I didn't see the corresponding implementation in your PR, tho (please correct me if I missed it). If config library only stores the best one for the sake of tuning performance and disk space, how do I store all configs like now if I prefer? In addition, I don't think storing all explored configs is a problem. I stored the whole history all the time for the research purpose and didn't feel any performance problem. For the disk space, my `history.json` for 2000 records is about 1.3M. Taking mobilenet v2 for instance, it has 31 tasks in total, meaning 40.3M history file.

I didn't want to include full logs because I was hoping to also be able to use config library to distribute tuned configs, however it should be fine to just 'export' a config library with only optimal configs.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I propose the following. Have each auto-tuning session create a new 'job'. This job will have an entry in a JSON file ('job index') containing at least the target string, start/finish time of the job and a path to the history file generated. Optionally we permit some arbitrary JSON to describe the platform in more detail.

I didn't want to include full logs because I was hoping to also be able to use config library to distribute tuned configs, however it should be fine to just 'export' a config library with only optimal configs.\r\n> \r\nGot your point, altough I think you can always pick the best config before distribution like the current AutoTVM use case. Current AutoTVM log all configs to a JSON file, and if a user only wants to keep the best one, she uses `autotvm.record.pick_best` to generate another small JSON that only contains the best config for each layer (task).\r\n\r\n> In that case, I propose the following. Have each auto-tuning session create a new 'job'. This job will have an entry in a JSON file ('job index') containing at least the target string, start/finish time of the job and a path to the history file generated. Optionally we permit some arbitrary JSON to describe the platform in more detail. By default, we delete the history file when a job completes (but keep the job entry in the index), however a flag can be passed to retain the history.\r\n> \r\nIf I undertand correctly, you are going to add tuning process metadata to the JSON file in addition to the configs, like the example code snippet you proposed in the very beginning of this RFC. Since you propose to use config library as the \"database\" to log all configs (the argument of `log_to_file` callback), you have to make sure the current `history.json` is still always available with explored configs whenever the task is interrupted. Maybe we can store two JSON files (e.g., task.json and history.json) to make a clear separation?\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is naming. `ConfigLibrary` seems not accurate in this case. To me, it's more like a `TaskContext` or `TaskSession`. Also we should use task instead of job to be consistent.\r\n\r\n> Now if a task needs to be resume, first a simple check can be done to see if the existing optimal config has already been tuned with sufficiently many trials (and with the right tuner/platform). If so, skip, otherwise search the job index to see if any history files qualify to restart the tuning. In that case, we can use your proposal.\r\n\r\nYeah I think this part is relatively clear.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/545097314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/545098221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4136#issuecomment-545098221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4136","id":545098221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTA5ODIyMQ==","user":{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T18:40:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T18:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@soiferj @minminsun @vinx13 Can you update on your reviews?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/545098221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/545100193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4174#issuecomment-545100193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4174","id":545100193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTEwMDE5Mw==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T18:45:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T18:45:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix.
