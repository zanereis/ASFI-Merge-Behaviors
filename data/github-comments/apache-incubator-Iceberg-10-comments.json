think I am getting it now but there are a couple of questions I want to clarify before updating the PR.\r\n\r\nOf course, having a way to roll back the entire table state and minimizing changes to the `Catalog` API are reasonable benefits. The drawback is that we will have to create a separate instance of `HiveTableOperations` with its own HMS client pool.\r\n\r\nI am not sure we need to create a table and then replace its metadata to simply register a table from a metadata file. If we do so, someone might actually query the table before we swap the metadata location.\r\n\r\nThis snippet creates a table and sets the location correctly from the beginning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTableOperations ops = newTableOps(identifier);\r\nHadoopInputFile metadataFile = HadoopInputFile.fromLocation(metadataFileLocation, conf);\r\nTableMetadata metadata = TableMetadataParser.read(ops, metadataFile);\r\nops.commit(null, metadata);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn theory, this can be executed directly without the catalog and will be sufficient to create a table form an existing metadata file. As suggested, we can extend `TableOperations` with `setMetadataLocation` that will be used for rolling back entire table state for tables already present in the catalog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/513714263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/513761620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/286#issuecomment-513761620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/286","id":513761620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzc2MTYyMA==","user":{"login":"timmylicheng","id":5977937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Nzc5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5977937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng","html_url":"https://github.com/timmylicheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T11:58:42Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T11:58:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just started to get into iceberg.

It returns instances of `ColumnarBatch` on each iteration. \r\n - `ArrowSchemaUtil` contains Iceberg to Arrow type conversion. This was copied from [3] . Added by @danielcweeks  . Thanks for that!\r\n - `VectorizedParquetValueReaders` contains ParquetValueReaders used for reading/decoding the Parquet rowgroups (aka pagestores as referred to in the code) \r\n - `VectorizedSparkParquetReaders` contains the visitor implementations to map Parquet types to appropriate value readers. I implemented the struct visitor so that the root schema can be mapped properly. This has the added benefit of vectorization support for structs, so yay!\r\n - For the initial version the value readers read an entire row group into a single Arrow `FieldVector`. this i'd imagine will require tuning for right batch sizing but i'v gone with one batch per rowgroup for now.\r\n - Arrow Field Vectors are wrapped using `ArrowColumnVector` which is Spark's `ColumnVector` implementation backed by Arrow. This is the first contact point between Spark and Arrow interfaces. \r\n - ArrowColumnVectors are stitched together into a `ColumnarBatch` by `ColumnarBatchReader` . This is my replacement for `InternalRowReader` which maps Structs to Columnar Batches. This allows us to have nested structs where each level of nesting would be a nested columnar batch. Lemme know what you think of this approach. \r\n - I'v added value readers for all supported primitive types listed in `AvroDataTest`. There's a corresponding test for vectorized reader under `TestSparkParquetVectorizedReader` \r\n - I haven't fixed all the Checkstyle errors so you will have to turn checkstyle off in build.gradle. Also skip tests while building.. sorry! :-(\r\n\r\nP.S. There's some unused code under `ArrowReader.java`  Ignore this as it's not used. This was from my previous impl of Vectorization. I'v kept it around to compare performance.\r\n\r\nLemme know what folks think of the approach. I'm getting this working for our scale test benchmark and will report back with numbers.

Glue implements the interface directly as [GlueMetastore](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/presto-hive/src/main/java/io/prestosql/plugin/hive/metastore/glue/GlueHiveMetastore.java) using the AWS SDK for Java.\r\n\r\nPresto also has a [ThriftMetastore](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/presto-hive/src/main/java/io/prestosql/plugin/hive/metastore/thrift/ThriftMetastore.java) interface that uses the generated libthrift classes such as `org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.Table` from the Apache Hive dependency (except for table and column statistics classes which don't exist in Hive). The implementation [ThriftHiveMetastore](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/presto-hive/src/main/java/io/prestosql/plugin/hive/metastore/thrift/ThriftHiveMetastore.java) handles retry and JMX statistics collection, maps Thrift exceptions into Presto exceptions, and some other basic mapping including `null` to `Optional`.\r\n\r\nThrift implements `HiveMetastore` using [BridgingHiveMetastore](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/presto-hive/src/main/java/io/prestosql/plugin/hive/metastore/thrift/BridgingHiveMetastore.java) which translates to the `ThriftMetastore` interface and converts the model objects using [ThriftMetastoreUtil](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/presto-hive/src/main/java/io/prestosql/plugin/hive/metastore/thrift/ThriftMetastoreUtil.java).\r\n\r\nIceberg needs a smaller number of methods, but the complexity comes from the model objects. Doing a generic conversion from `org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.Table` to  `com.amazonaws.services.glue.model.Table` seems feasible, since the structures are very similar, but much of the code would go unused (e.g., Iceberg doesn't use Hive partitioning or bucketing). It might be cleaner to duplicate the logic at a higher level using the AWS Glue client directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/514430334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/514432084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/307#issuecomment-514432084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/307","id":514432084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDQzMjA4NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T00:30:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T00:30:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I saw one table with a wrong partitioning that caused a commit of ± 2 million files and ±500 MB manifest size.

As explained in the previous comment, the Presto `HiveMetastore` interface uses Presto model objects. Trying to write an adapter layer would likely be more complicated and more code than the ~200 lines of the current `HiveTableOperations` class.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I don't agree that trying to use the same code everywhere is the always the best choice. One of the big advantages of Iceberg is that it's designed to be an open standard with a specification. You need multiple implementations (and compliance tests) to keep the specification honest.\r\n\r\nAs for `BaseMetastoreTableOperations`, I agree that extending it is problematic (as is subclassing in general). At this point, very little code is used from it, and its design forces some strangeness on the Presto subclass, so it's probably best if the Presto code inlines it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/514505399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/514530474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/280#issuecomment-514530474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/280","id":514530474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDUzMDQ3NA==","user":{"login":"timmylicheng","id":5977937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Nzc5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5977937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng","html_url":"https://github.com/timmylicheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timmylicheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T08:18:34Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T08:18:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue Now every manifest only has one partitionSpecId.
