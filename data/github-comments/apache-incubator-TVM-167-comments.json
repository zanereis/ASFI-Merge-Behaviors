It did indeed have a speed improvement.\r\n> \r\n> After running CUDA autotune a while it looked like there was a GPU memory leak (some trial made it jump hundreds of megs). I spent a long time looking for a leak in the C++ code, but couldn't find anything. With my very limited understanding, it seemed as if the failed/slow cuda kernels it would test, were themselves leaking. Only killing the process would free the GPU memory.\r\n> \r\n> I abandoned the in-process running of trials and moved to a similar design as the Linux current implementation.\r\n\r\nThanks for the experience sharing. It sounds reasonable.\r\nThe current implementation in this PR lets every executor forked process acquire a new CUDA context and this is the only solution I have right now to avoid some of the initialization errors. Ideally the process should be killed right after the child process finished so that the next job (with another new forked process) could start from a clean context. However, apparently it doesn't work as I expected.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22950047/cuda-initialization-error-after-fork

If we can make sure it is the bug of LLVM, we then can discuss how to deal with this case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/596177857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/596192355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4534#issuecomment-596192355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4534","id":596192355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjE5MjM1NQ==","user":{"login":"YunLexi","id":15028187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI4MTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15028187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi","html_url":"https://github.com/YunLexi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YunLexi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T10:58:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T10:59:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ANSHUMAN87 \r\nI just try to run the following tutorial with resnet101_v1, [https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/tutorials/frontend/from_mxnet.py](url), the program hangs at    https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/87faaf12f3d2b792bacccadeb369236ab5c5b45b/python/tvm/contrib/nvcc.py#L95 not doing anything, but this tutorial works fine if I change the model to resnet18_v1 or resnet50_v1 with cuda as target.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/596192355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/596221752","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4979#issuecomment-596221752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4979","id":596221752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjIyMTc1Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T16:09:18Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T16:09:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To chime in a bit here.

To be clear, this isn't a *bug* in the implementation (it's not infinite recursion, just very deep recursion, because if I remove the stack limit on my system the code works), but it is a problematic implementation. The nature of the dead code elimination implementation requires extensive recursive calls to visit every node of the graph. Since this is implemented as naive recursion, for a large enough graph (like the kind you get when using auto-diff to generate gradient functions Relay) it is easy to exhaust the default stack limit. It is not indicated anywhere obvious in the documentation that users should increase their stack limit, and the resulting segfault when this happens can be really confusing to understand if you don't consider stack overflow.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the original issue, there are two things that should be done:\r\n\r\n1. make it obvious in the documentation that users should increase their stack size if they encounter segfaults of this nature, or better yet, implement something like a recursion counter inside that graph traversal that warns users when they're reaching high levels of recursion in their graphs that could trigger stackoverflow\r\n2. fix the stack overflow, by either figuring out how to optimize the recursion implementation so that the compiler can perform tail call optimization, or convert the recursive code to iteration/reimplement with an explicit stack","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/596512916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/596538561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4534#issuecomment-596538561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4534","id":596538561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjUzODU2MQ==","user":{"login":"ANSHUMAN87","id":32511895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTExODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32511895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87","html_url":"https://github.com/ANSHUMAN87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T13:56:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T13:56:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SWu : Thank you!

Let us break down the problem.\r\n\r\nFirstly, CI’s tflite version is 1.13. We could keep your tf version as the same firstly.\r\n\r\nSecond, as I suggested before, you could use tflite_convert tool to convert quantized model layer by layer\r\n`tflite_convert --input_format=TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF --graph_def_file=\"xx.pb\" --output_file=xx.tflite --output_format=TFLITE --input_arrays=input --input_shapes=1,224,224,3 --std_dev_values=127 --mean_values=127 --inference_type=QUANTIZED_UINT8 --inference_input_type=QUANTIZED_UINT8 --default_ranges_min=0 --default_ranges_max=6 --output_arrays=xx`\r\n\r\nreplace the output arrays args to your target layer name. Like the first layer name / second layer name until you find the issue layer.

alternative is to require C++17 which gcc7 supports and ships by default in Ubuntu 18.04.\r\nC++17 compiler can be used on as old systems as RHEL6 / CentOS 6 from 2010, via Redhats devtoolset.
