It's only because the input of the iALS is a sparse matrix, and it would not make much sense to have more than one values for the same element of the matrix. E.g. to aggregate multiple listenings for the same (user,artist) pair, one could count them, and use the count as the implicit rating. We simply used the value 1.0 for every user-artist pair, but the algorithm works with any (positive) values, not only binary interactions.\n\nWe've only measured Flink against itself, as the main ALS algorithm is already in Flink. It would be interesting to measure against Spark and other solutions, but that might not reflect the performance of our iALS extension, but rather the performance of ALS itself. That seems to be another issue for me.

I agree we should perform a benchmark in the future. Furthermore, based on the results we could optimize the algorithm.\n\nI split up the test, and rebased to the current master. I checked the `java.Iterable` again, and commented at your original concern. I am afraid we'll have to use the `java.Iterable`.\n\nRegarding the expected results, I've only generated the small input data by hand. Before that I checked whether the Spark and Flink implementations converged to approximately same factor matrices (I only checked the value of the objective function, not the whole matrices). Because of the random initialization we cannot guarantee to have the same results, but there were 2-3 points that both Spark and Flink converged to.\n\nThere might be better methods for testing, but I considered this sufficient as the original `ALSITSuite` did nothing more. Of course, this test only checks whether the algorithm works the same way after some modifications (e.g. optimization), and does not check whether the algorithm initially works or not, but it's the same case with the original ALS. Do you know what is the assurance for the explicit ALS working good? (It must be good, as I also checked the results of the explicit ALS against Spark on toy-data.) AFAIK Spark generates random matrices of known rank, factorizes them, and checks whether the error is low (see their [ALSSuite](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/recommendation/ALSSuite.scala)). In the future, it might be worth to follow their approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/259408174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/259411321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2542#issuecomment-259411321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2542","id":259411321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTQxMTMyMQ==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T13:12:15Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T13:12:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gaborhermann Yup the approach taken by the Spark community for testing is closer to what we would like to have for non-deterministic algorithms, but what you have implemented now should suffice on the assumption that the ALS implementation is correct.\n\n@tillrohrmann Initially implemented ALS so I'm not sure how he arrived at the expected results. It would be a good idea for the future to document how we generate test data so it's easy to replicate and validate the process.

Regarding your above comments:\n- I think we got the \"flattening\" concern backwards. What I meant and wanted to avoid was to move all files into single directory. The calling code asks to simply upload the lib dir, and I think it should be copied structurally intact. I think I saw on the user list a complaint that properties files were not moved -- this should fix that. Or am I missing some other concern?\n- The new commit 26c8511701d6b852a3c6f8b306f4b5da8e7b8479 now only modifies flink-yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/yarn/Utils.java\n- I kept the check for file:// scheme for now just because I think it's safer to check than assume it's set down the call stack but I can hunt down and change those calls if you think it's best. \n\nSince this PR is pretty tortured, maybe I should create a new one with just the above commit?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/259523999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/259538106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2448#issuecomment-259538106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2448","id":259538106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTUzODEwNg==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T21:56:48Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T21:56:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmetzger @iampeter \nI've rebased the code and updated it according to your suggestions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/259538106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/259542880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2775#issuecomment-259542880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2775","id":259542880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTU0Mjg4MA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T22:17:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T22:17:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix!
