It seems mesos sent caught SIGNAL 10 and sent SIGTERM to heron-executor. Heron-executor will then clean (kill, send SIGTERM to all spawned processes). Stream mgr was also killed and printed the stack trace above. So I don't think the death of stream mgr is a result rather than a cause.\nSo I have questions:\n1. Did u run \"heron kill ...\" to kill the job at ~ 09:31:46 ?\n2. What does SIGNAL 10 mean in aurora/mesos?\n3. Could u check whether the job hit aurora limitation (for instance, used more ram than required) and was killed by aurora?\n\nAlso, currently the stderr & stdout of stream mgr can lose: (https://github.com/twitter/heron/issues/958)\nSo can u try to change here: https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/executor/src/python/heron-executor.py#L359\nto forcibly redirect the logs to a file and share the content of the file with us?\n\nThanks \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/230905645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/230927586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1027#issuecomment-230927586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1027","id":230927586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDkyNzU4Ng==","user":{"login":"wuye9036","id":848649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODY0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036","html_url":"https://github.com/wuye9036","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuye9036/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T22:34:38Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T22:36:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In Linux, it means SIGUSR1 as same as POSIX standard.\n\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/asm-generic/signal.h\n\nAurora treats this SIGNAL as same as KILL.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/aurora/blob/b24619b28c4dbb35188871bacd0091a9e01218e3/src/main/python/apache/thermos/runner/thermos_runner.py#L159\n\nCould we get the log from slave.cpp of aurora?

No, I did not run the \"heron kill... \" command at that time.  I ran it a couple minutes later when the subsequently launched tasks also failed.  The logs you are referring to are the ones from the first task incarnation.\n2. @wuye9036 commented on this, I believe.\n3. I did not check any Aurora specific logs but you were right: it seems to be a RAM issue!\n\nI followed your guidance and re-built Heron from the latest source code (git `4cbe5ae96b72f`) and it generated a Java Heap out-of-memory error!  The two slave nodes are each configured with 4GB of RAM, and Mesos advertised about 2.7GB available on each.  When I ran the ExclamationTopology out of the box (the code requests 512MB for each of the 2 containers: word and exclaim, so I though it should be around 1GB), and looked at the --verbose output of \"heron submit --verbose ...\" I saw that Aurora blew it up to 3GB RAM_PER_CONTAINER!\n\nNext, I tried lowering the RAM requested in the source code to 1MB (failed immediately upon \"heron submit\" asking for a minimum of 192MB) then to 200MB so that it would have a chance to run on my slave nodes.  Then I encountered the Java Heap Space error, which would explain how it failed at different points in the Google Protobuf code (because the out-of-memory gets hit at different times from run to run).\n\nFinally, I bit the bullet and powered everything down (well, just the 2 slaves) and increased the VMs to have 16GB rather than 4GB.  Now things seemed to somewhat work with the code recompiled at the original level of requesting 512MB per container.  I even got some log lines with the bolt counting some emits!  However, the topology still failed and I am running out of time now to debug this further.  I fear I won't get to it until Monday...\n\nThanks for all your help so far and have a great weekend.  I'll be looking into this further on Monday morning German time.

But could this be the culprit?  The Aurora processes `fetch_*` run through without a hitch but then the `launch_heron_executor` fails.  Could the mistaken reference to `--announcer-ensemble` cause the error later on???\n\nAttached are the logs from the above cited run and generated with:\n\n```\n$ tar -cvzf ~/supervisor1-logs.tgz --exclude=*.tar.gz --exclude=*.jar --exclude=*.pex --exclude=.pex --exclude=heron-core .\n$ cd\n$ zip supervisor1-logs.zip supervisor1-logs.tgz\n```\n\n[supervisor1-logs.zip](https://github.com/twitter/heron/files/356829/supervisor1-logs.zip)\n\nI am also looking at `supervisor2` and the same issues turn up there.\n\nFinally, I am trying to read and understand the code at `heron/executor/src/python/heron-executor.py` and specifically how the class HeronExecutor gets initialized but I don't see an immediate place where the announcer ensemble gets conveyed.  Maybe it is some hidden Aurora configuration?  Which would be weird because I was able to run the Aurora hello_world example from their Getting Started tutorial issued from nimbus (master) to the supervisors (slaves) without a problem...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/231693429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
