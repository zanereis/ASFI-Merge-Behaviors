Therefore how about adding parser support for TUMBLE (and HOP) in the GROUP BY clause? This would be deprecated functionality, and removed at some point. The parser would be hard-wired to create calls to that function, and therefore function does not need to be called literally TUMBLE. It could be called \"TUMBLE_OLD\" or whatever.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/535647198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/535658020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1457#issuecomment-535658020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1457","id":535658020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTY1ODAyMA==","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T19:45:03Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T19:45:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@julianhyde I like your idea. So we save \"TUMBLE\" for one operator and use a new name for another operator, but Parser will code one so it will create an operator directly without caring about operator name. By doing so operator overloading is also avoided. I like it.\r\n\r\nYou suggest code old TUMBLE into parser(thus rename old TUMBLE operator to maybe \"TUMBLE_old\"), which seems to me there will be a backward compatible issue: maybe someone is already depending on \"TUMBLE\" as the name to lookup the old TUMBLE operator? If this is a concern it would be better to use new name for the new operator and code the new operator into Parser. And then we should start a deprecation process at some point to say only maintain old operator for 2 ~ 3 versions, and finally switch the name back.
