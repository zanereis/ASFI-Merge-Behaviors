SQLRewriteEngine.isRewriteDistinctLiteral => isMeedRewriteDistinctLiteral\r\n4. SQLRewriteEngine.isContainsAggregationDistinctToken can move to sqlStatement, and let token type as an input parameter\r\n5. SelectStatement.getFirstSelectItemStartIndex() should as a Token and Split append distinct from rewriteInitialLiteral\r\n6. Make sure responsibility of rewriter and engine, only rewriter can use token\r\n7. EncryptSQLRewriter & ShardingSQLRewriter can new instance out of loop\r\n8. Make unify with stopPosition & stopIndex\r\n9. sqlBuilder is global field with SQLRewriteEngine, may avoid pass from private method by input parameter\r\n10. Make accurate with javadoc on SQLRewriter.rewrite\r\n11. Avoid start a new line if not exceed 200 char one line, at line 107 on EncryptSQLRewriter\r\n12. Make input parameter as same sequence for differnet methods, like: EncryptSQLRewriter.encryptInsertOptimizeResultUnit and EncryptSQLRewriter.encryptInsertOptimizeResult's param: unit\r\n13. add Predicate if Optional can not be absent, at line 105 on EncryptSQLRewriter\r\n14.

**For English only**, other languages will not accept.\r\n\r\n**ok.... When can we optimize 'in' query**\r\nfor example： db1 (table_1, table_3, table_5), db2(table_0,table_2,table_4). sharding key is 'id'.sharding role is 'id %6'。 We have 3 records : id = 1, id = 2, id =4 。 so the real sql is : select * from db1.table_1 where id in (1 ,2,4) , select * from db2.table_2 where id in (1 ,2,4), select * from db2.table_4 where id in (1 ,2,4). so much in，it is not necessary i think。if we do batchGetByids => in (.............), it will do in all tables, it is inefficient i think。thanks\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/494703756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/494706647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2425#issuecomment-494706647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2425","id":494706647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDcwNjY0Nw==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T08:29:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T08:29:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank

@jimmycheng888, Can you provide your database type(MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL or others), and Which connection pool you used?\r\n> \r\n> And you can try to upgrade to 4.0.0-RC1. This version has some enhancement for this problem.\r\n\r\nThe database I use is PostgreSQL, the database connection pool is HikariDataSource, and there are too many connection pool threads in multiple data sources. Will it affect the production environment?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/495040184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/495042751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2420#issuecomment-495042751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2420","id":495042751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTA0Mjc1MQ==","user":{"login":"KomachiSion","id":37170243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTcwMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37170243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion","html_url":"https://github.com/KomachiSion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T02:23:10Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T02:26:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The database I use is PostgreSQL, the database connection pool is HikariDataSource\r\n\r\nAbout PostgreSQL and Oracle, ShardingSphere will get all tables in datasource even these tables are not sharding tables.

So the sharding column name must be the same as sql column.  Otherwise, the corresponding Column object will not be found.\r\nIn your example, the configuration should be \r\n```\r\nmdm_acct_conn:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds${0..1}.mdm_acct_conn\r\n      databaseStrategy:\r\n        inline:\r\n          shardingColumn: Ac_Id\r\n          algorithmExpression: ds${Ac_Id.intdiv(10000) % 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can try to use custom sharding algorithm which implement by yourself. Only implement `org.apache.shardingsphere.core.strategy.route.ShardingStrategy` interface. In this case, Shardingsphere only call your implement method `doSharding`, income the SQL column name and the value, whether filtering case sensitivity is determined by the algorithm you implement.\r\nconfiguration like:\r\n```\r\nmdm_acct_conn:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds${0..1}.mdm_acct_conn\r\n      databaseStrategy:\r\n        standard:\r\n          shardingColumn: ac_id\r\n          precise-algorithm-class-name: ${full class name your implement algorithm}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/495434158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/495435302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2420#issuecomment-495435302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2420","id":495435302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTQzNTMwMg==","user":{"login":"KomachiSion","id":37170243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTcwMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37170243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion","html_url":"https://github.com/KomachiSion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-24T00:59:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T00:59:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jimmycheng888, Any new information about this problem?
