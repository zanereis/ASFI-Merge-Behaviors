Currently the producer will still send ProduceRequest with version 3 if the message magic version is 2. This is because the newly-added produce version 4 is incompatible with 0.11 broker. The downside of this is that server will translate KafkaStorageException to NotLeaderForPartitionException. But this should not cause any problem to the functionality of the producer.

@vahidhashemian. Have we considered rethrowing the same exception with the original exception as the cause? Ideally, we would add a method to the future that does that so that the logic doesn't have to be repeated in multiple places. Using `addSuppressed` kind of works although it seems a little bit of a hack. See the Javadoc:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  * <p>Note that when one exception {@linkplain\r\n     * #initCause(Throwable) causes} another exception, the first\r\n     * exception is usually caught and then the second exception is\r\n     * thrown in response.  In other words, there is a causal\r\n     * connection between the two exceptions.\r\n     *\r\n     * In contrast, there are situations where two independent\r\n     * exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular\r\n     * in the {@code try} block of a {@code try}-with-resources\r\n     * statement and the compiler-generated {@code finally} block\r\n     * which closes the resource.\r\n     *\r\n     * In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be\r\n     * propagated.  In the {@code try}-with-resources statement, when\r\n     * there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from\r\n     * the {@code try} block is propagated and the exception from the\r\n     * {@code finally} block is added to the list of exceptions\r\n     * suppressed by the exception from the {@code try} block.  As an\r\n     * exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple\r\n     * suppressed exceptions.\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315723512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315731963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3516#issuecomment-315731963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3516","id":315731963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTczMTk2Mw==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T11:39:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T11:39:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

My previous question was that is it common to require different topic configs for the repartition topics. The current mechanism is that:\r\n\r\n0. Kafka server side topics config is global for all possible topics ever created.\r\n1. The streams config is global (i.e. this PR) that affects all internal topics being created, including the repartition and changelog topics.\r\n2. The `StateStoreSupplier` allows you to override the configs for its changelog topics.\r\n3. For repartition topics we do not yet have a way to override it on a per-topic basis.\r\n\r\nSo my question was mainly around 3) above whether it is as common as a requirement to override per-topic as

For large topics, having control over retention settings is useful to avoid wasting too much space. \r\n- when dealing with different amounts of data in different parts of the topology, adjusting the number of partitions on some parts of the topology might be useful. e.g. large amounts of data could benefit from a larger number of partitions, but if the data gets reduced throughout the topology it becomes useful to lower the number of partitions to avoid an unnecessary large number of state stores.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315916851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315921144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3540#issuecomment-315921144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3540","id":315921144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTkyMTE0NA==","user":{"login":"derrickdoo","id":271961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTk2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo","html_url":"https://github.com/derrickdoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrickdoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T00:15:24Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T00:15:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang updated the TOC to point at the new Streams landing page.
