The result is 100. That's because can not read data in parquet file if requiredStructSchema is empty. I think its a problem about parquet 1.12.1.\r\nBut I can pass the full schema to the reader of parquet, and extract the required schema outside to solve this.\r\n\r\n`TestMORDataSource.testPrunedFiltered` also fails due to use `DefaultHoodieRecordPayload`. Both `PAYLOAD_ORDERING_FIELD_PROP_KEY ` and `PAYLOAD_EVENT_TIME_FIELD_PROP_KEY ` use `ts` as the default value and are never changed along with `preCombineField`, that cause a failure or not to update values with a latest precombine value.\r\nSo I set the current `preCombineField` to `PAYLOAD_ORDERING_FIELD_PROP_KEY ` and `PAYLOAD_EVENT_TIME_FIELD_PROP_KEY `.\r\nWhy this case can success in Spark with version < 3.2, it's so wried. But these changes work in all Spark versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1010570382/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1010577389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4300#issuecomment-1010577389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4300","id":1010577389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM48PC_t","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T02:49:02Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T02:49:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Could we also get the docs updated\r\n\r\nYes, I'll follow up on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1010577389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1010577806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3929#issuecomment-1010577806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3929","id":1010577806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM48PDGO","user":{"login":"watermelon12138","id":49849410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODQ5NDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49849410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138","html_url":"https://github.com/watermelon12138","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermelon12138/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T02:50:03Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T02:50:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello, I hava some questions.

just did a cursory glance here and I am not very familiar. But can you talk a bit more about how the flow will work for a regular Hive table to read Hudi tables work in this new design ? Will the presto hive connector machinery be able to call into the presto-hudi connector being proposed ? \r\n\r\nHow about the advanced features of presto-hive like some of the pushdown logic it applies (to leverage the parquet rowgroup stats), or leveraging other advanced Parquet/ORC scanning features like Aria etc. I am not clear on the details but just want to be clear that such improvements in the presto-hive don't need to be ported over to the new presto-hudi connector in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the user impact of this new connector ? I expect no impact : Queries written against hudi hive tables should continue to work as efficiently as before. \r\n\r\nCan you also comment on the write path ? Does this new design open up the possibility to write into Hudi tables via Presto ?
