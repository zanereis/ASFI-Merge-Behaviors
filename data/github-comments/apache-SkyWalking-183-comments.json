I followed the instructions. The \"APM\" Dashboard of SkyWalking was showed correctly, but nothing on the Tracing page, while the tracing data could be seen on.Jaeger. With the current method, nothing is needed to be done on the application code side, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/683507225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/683507719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5394#issuecomment-683507719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5394","id":683507719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzUwNzcxOQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-31T01:37:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T01:37:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that is another thing. Tracing must have something related to the codes, even Javaagent(auto-instrumentation) is doing the thing in the runtime only. \r\n\r\nALS solution is not for tracing, tracing is for the language agent case. You could install agent/SDK in your application, and close the `analysis` option in the OAP. Then you have the trace on the page.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/683507719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
