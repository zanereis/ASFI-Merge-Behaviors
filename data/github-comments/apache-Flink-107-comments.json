Here's a few suggestions to align it even further.\n\nThe problem of _managing_ a Flink cluster is mostly independent from _using_ a cluster (to submit and manage jobs).    I would like to see the two concerns be cleanly separated.    In this PR, the `ClusterDescriptor` handles creating the cluster, then produces a `Client` with which to manage jobs _and to handle shutdown_.    I suggest that a new component - the `YarnDispatcher` - be introduced to handle all lifecycle operations for a cluster.   Make the `ClusterDescriptor` be an entity class that is given to the dispatcher.  \n\nA related issue is that it is only possible to use the `YarnClusterClient` to interact with a newly-created YARN session, not a pre-existing one.   When submitting a job to an existing YARN session, seems the `StandaloneClusterClient` is used.\n\nThe `detached` flags could use clarification.   In the `Client` context, the detached concept seems related to interactivity with the job (tailing the status messages, etc).   I don't think it should imply anything about the lifecycle of the cluster; leave that to the dispatcher.   The `stopAfterJob` method should move accordingly to the dispatcher.\n\nHow this relates to Mesos is, the `MesosDispatcher` component will run in the Mesos cluster, manage numerous sessions, and be accessed remotely by the CLI.

Do we really need a QueryableStateStream exposed in the API? As you said this is just a pretty basic sink that anyone can probably inline who knows Flink enough to use the States. And I am guessing looking inside other operators is probably the most interesting use-case for this new feature. \n2. If we decide to keep the QueryableStateStream could it be just implemented as a simple RichSink? stream.addSink(...) instead of adding another operator to the runtime layer\n3. I think it would be great to make the KvStateClient somehow aware of the types, because passing keynamespace byte arrays will be confusing for users as they will have no idea what the namespace is. The namespaces are pretty internal to the system. Maybe we could allow users to register serializers for state ids in the KvStateClient so they would not need to manually pass byte arrays and they could work with the actual keys. Also if they don't want to specify the namespace, we could then serialize it with the VoidSerializer as it usually happens in the runtime in most cases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222606282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222625496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2051#issuecomment-222625496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2051","id":222625496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjYyNTQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T08:34:16Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T08:34:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1. I think that you are very much looking at it with your specific use case in mind, which is (I think) querying other operators from within your operators. To me, that's not the main use case for queryable state though... For that, it's true that the `QueryableStateStream` does not provide much help. If you are already using partitioned state manually, then you will probably go with the `setQueryable` method, that's true. But for some state like Flink's internal windows, you don't have access to the `StateDescriptor` (which is currently not exposed for queries on the API though). Furthermore, I think it's good to provide a low barrier way of doing things. But if others feel the same, I'm certainly OK with removing it.\n2. I think that would be possible, yes. I agree that the `QueryableStateStream` is conceptually similar to a sink.\n3. I agree, but that was on purpose for the first version until we figure out how to expose it properly. You have utilities in `KvStateRequestSerializer` to serialize key and namespace and you can use `QueryableStateStream` to access the key and value serializer. Namespace is usually `VoidNamespace` if you are not querying windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222625496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222627001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2051#issuecomment-222627001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2051","id":222627001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjYyNzAwMQ==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T08:40:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T08:40:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are probably right that I am little biased regarding (1), sorry :) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222627001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222633219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2049#issuecomment-222633219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2049","id":222633219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjYzMzIxOQ==","user":{"login":"gallenvara","id":12931563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMxNTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12931563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara","html_url":"https://github.com/gallenvara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gallenvara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T09:09:19Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T09:09:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske I have changed the return type to generic `T` in `AvgAggregation` class because when return `null.asInstanceof[Short/Int/..]` , the value can convert to `0`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222633219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222634611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2033#issuecomment-222634611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2033","id":222634611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjYzNDYxMQ==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T09:15:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T09:15:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing.

Let me quickly show what I mean. `KeyedStream` would have this method:\n\n```\n<S extends State> QueryableStateStream<KEY, S> asQueryableState(\n    String queryableStateName,\n    StateDescriptor<S, ?> stateDescriptor);\n```\n\nthe signature of `QueryableStateStream` would be like this:\n\n```\npublic class QueryableStateStream<K, S extends State> {\n    private StateDescriptor<S, ?> stateDescriptor;\n\n    /**\n     * Read the state represented by this stream using a state client\n     */ \n    public S read(K key, QueryableStateClient client) {\n        return stateDescriptor.bind(new QueryStateBinder(client.read(key, stateName)));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe nice thing about `StateDescriptor.bind()` is that you can use this to create a state reader based on the state type. You pass in a custom `StateBackend` (this should really be called `StateBinder`, btw). That constructs a state reader that deserializes the bytes read from the state client.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222648249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222650638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2053#issuecomment-222650638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2053","id":222650638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjY1MDYzOA==","user":{"login":"joseprupi","id":4953512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTM1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4953512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi","html_url":"https://github.com/joseprupi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joseprupi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T10:27:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T10:27:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, thanks @vasia !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222650638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222656652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2052#issuecomment-222656652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2052","id":222656652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjY1NjY1Mg==","user":{"login":"danielblazevski","id":10012612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10012612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski","html_url":"https://github.com/danielblazevski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T10:59:33Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T10:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chiwanpark done.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222656652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/222688842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2056#issuecomment-222688842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2056","id":222688842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjY4ODg0Mg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T13:31:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T13:31:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure whether the changes fix the problem.
