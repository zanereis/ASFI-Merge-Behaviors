That impact existing user.\n2. name 'LOCAL_STORAGE'  and 'REMOTE_STORAGE' is not appropriate. because user provided storage layer can be anything. It can be based on local filesystem, it can be based on remote storage, it can be based on something other.\n\nHere's my suggestion,\n\nLet ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE receive comma separated class names, so user can use 1 to n \nstorages (for now, i think it's okay only handle up to 2 storages).
