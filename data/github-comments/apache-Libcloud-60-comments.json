for reporting this.\r\n\r\nThat code is pretty old and I'm wondering how much of it still relevant. It appears a lot of it was needed in the past due to compatibility with old Python version.\r\n\r\nI would personally feel much more comfortable if that code could be simplified to reduce all the possible permutations and edge cases. This should reduce the surface area and make security and other issues less likely.\r\n\r\nAnd in general I think that code is not following best practices. Doing something like this here (https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/abba8c1719a8bda6db8efde2d46fd1b423ae4304/libcloud/container/types.py#L19) and simply accepting any server certificate when that error is received seems like a bad and insecure practice to me. So if anything, that could should be removed.\r\n\r\nIf we want to leave such option in the code, it should be an explicit opt-in by the end user - they need to understand and accept the consequences if they chose to skip ca cert validation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1688297032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1688501819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1940#issuecomment-1688501819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1940","id":1688501819,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485kpH47","user":{"login":"munahaf","id":1132506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf","html_url":"https://github.com/munahaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/munahaf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T16:07:16Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T16:07:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"At least the change I proposed appears less confusing and still retains the original logic of the code.

I think we can apply the following fixes-\r\n\r\n# Case 1\r\nWe can rewrite the `vsphere.py` file into something like this- we put option for `keyfile` and `certfile`. Then it's completely depends on the user. They may not use the certificate chain but the support is there in the library.\r\n\r\n### [class VSphereNodeDriver](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/vsphere.py#L80)\r\n```py\r\n...\r\ncontext = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=ca_cert)\r\nif certfile and keyfile:\r\n    context.load_cert_chain(certfile=certfile, keyfile=keyfile)\r\nself.connection = connect.SmartConnect(\r\n    host=host,\r\n    port=port,\r\n    user=username,\r\n    pwd=password,\r\n    sslContext=context,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [class VSphere_REST_NodeDriver](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/vsphere.py#L1182)\r\nSince `VSphereNodeDriver` is used by this class too, we add support for certificate chain here too. The updated code would look something like this-\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef __init__(self, key, secret=None, secure=True, host=None, port=443, ca_cert=None, certfile=None, keyfile=None):\r\n    ...\r\n    if ca_cert:\r\n        self.connection.connection.ca_cert = ca_cert\r\n    else:\r\n        self.connection.connection.ca_cert = False\r\n    if certfile and keyfile:\r\n        self.connection.connection.certfile = certfile\r\n        self.connection.connection.keyfile = keyfile\r\n    else:\r\n        self.connection.connection.certfile = False\r\n        self.connection.connection.keyfile = False\r\n```\r\nAnd then use it as below-\r\n```py\r\nself.driver_soap = VSphereNodeDriver(\r\n    ...\r\n    ca_cert=self.connection.connection.ca_cert,\r\n    certfile=self.connection.connection.certfile,\r\n    keyfile=self.connection.connection.keyfile,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Case 2\r\nSince I don't have the entire context about the whole project, I think simply replacing `PROTOCOL_SSLv23` with `PROTOCOL_TLS` will suffice. The fixed code would look something like this-\r\n```py\r\nif \"certificate verify failed\" in error_message:\r\n                # bypass self signed certificates\r\n                try:\r\n                    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS)\r\n                    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1689352111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1689573005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1944#issuecomment-1689573005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1944","id":1689573005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485ktNaN","user":{"login":"ricardobranco777","id":10237751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM3NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10237751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777","html_url":"https://github.com/ricardobranco777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricardobranco777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-23T09:05:09Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T09:05:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The change looks good to me, but can you add a a couple of simple unit tests for it so we can get it merged?\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n> It seems like that for consistency reasons, `libcloud.container.Type` should eventually be made to inherit from `libcloud.common.type`.\r\n\r\nI'm very much in favour of doing that if we remove the dunder methods.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1689573005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/1694712444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1946#issuecomment-1694712444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1946","id":1694712444,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAZm485lA0J8","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-27T16:49:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T16:49:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the contribution.\r\n\r\nWhen you get a chance, can you please add some test case for those changes?
