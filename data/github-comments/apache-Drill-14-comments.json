That's why when we want to retrieve the data from such table we should consider the local timezone.\nOn the other hand parquet files don't involve the particular time zone and when we just read the file we shouldn't consdier a local timezone. And this is also standard drill behaviour with normal int64 timestamps.\nSo I decided that we need two `IMPALA_TIMESTAMP` functions: for hive and for regular parquet files.\nI left  `IMPALA_TIMESTAMP` function without local timezone retain and I added `IMPALA_TIMESTAMP_LOCALTIMEZONE` function (is used implicitly while reading hive timestamps with enabled drill native parquet reader). \n\nPlease let me know if this approach is good.\nChanges in a new commit for easy review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/257660405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/257684420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/600#issuecomment-257684420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/600","id":257684420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzY4NDQyMA==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-01T20:24:34Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T20:24:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.

So, the caching provider does in fact get used but then subsequently gets stuck in the apply() method of the ReflectiveRelMetadataProvider.  I did not attempt to debug why it got stuck there...partly because I am not very familiar with the way reflection is used in this provider.  Hence, my fix is an attempt to circumvent the issue.
