If a transform's `expand(input)` uses `input.getPipeline().getOptions()` to access required always-available things like `tempLocation`, this can be mostly mechanically replaced with `ProcessContext.getPipelineOptions()`. I think this is every use in `BigQueryIO`.\r\n2. If a transform's `expand(input)` uses `input.getPipeline().getOptions()` to configure itself, then these should be builder methods accepting `ValueProvider` and the existing types and design patterns for that are just right. I don't know of any uses like this at the moment.\r\n3. A transform's `validate(PipelineOptions)` method is now called after construction is complete; it is OK to give it `PipelineOptions`, though they should be moved to the actual execution environment. This is infeasible in the short term and needs more design work.\r\n\r\nI picked up this work sort of out of nowhere and didn't glean this context from my readings.
