The tests that were failing with M5, ShellServerIT and RowHashIT, now pass on this branch.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that too. It is unlikely that it broke any other tests, but I'll try to run the full ITs, just in case.\r\n\r\n> For some reason there is a test failing in the checks, MiniAccumuloClusterImplTest, but it passes for me when run locally so not sure whats going on there.\r\n\r\nYeah, it's probably just a temporary resource issue in the GH actions runner.

We're using it to keep a count of the number of threads currently permitted to perform the action. Technically, a sized thread pool would also have a counter, but my point wasn't really about counters... so much as it was about using higher-level concepts instead of using lower-level primitives directly, to manage the resource.\r\n\r\n>  I am not sure how we would do this with the Semaphore() and the ThreadPools class.\r\n\r\nIf I understand this code correctly (and I very well may not), the threads we're executing these writes in are coming from libthrift, created to handle the network request. I was thinking along the lines of having a thread pool / executor that handles the actual writes, and these RPC threads just delegate the write work to that pool, and wait on its Future. Could have a different pool for metadata writes and user table writes, so only user table writes are constrained. My understanding of the Semaphore solution is that we are just doing the write in the RPC thread from libthrift. I guess that's fine, assuming libthrift doesn't put a limit on the number of threads it creates and prevent us from writing metadata because all its threads are in use.\r\n\r\n> We could rename the property to `tserver.write.thread.permits` or something.\r\n\r\nNo, that's just exposing implementation details. It's fine with the current name, regardless of implementation. The only thing that might help is if the name indicated that it applied only to user tables, not to metadata tables. But I don't care about the name that much, if the description is good enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1095537411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1095683891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2614#issuecomment-1095683891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2614","id":1095683891,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5BTs8z","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T23:18:45Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T23:18:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I pulled the code from `ConfigCommand` so we can easily do anything we are doing there. And we could display config by different servers and have the server name as a node in the output.\r\n\r\nThe ConfigCommand has some of the same issues (as does the public API it calls). But, at the very least, you can't view any configuration in the shell unless you've done *some* kind of authentication. That's not true of this change to the monitor. This just provides it without any kind of authentication.\r\n\r\nTo partially address the misleading information problem, you could display the config for each server, but that would be a bit of information overload. Or you could just display the one, but with \"as reported by serverX\". However, either way, you'd have to either modify the public API, or bypass it to get the server information and talk directly via Thrift. I don't think that extra code is worth it when the benefits are marginal. And, ultimately, I don't think it would better than an authorized sysadmin securely grabbing a copy of the config files from each server's class path and dumping the ZK config to get the authoritative information, that they can already do today.\r\n\r\nOverall, though, I don't think the monitor's scope should grow to be a tool for configuration management, even if it is just used to report configuration. I'm also deeply uncomfortable exposing all this through the monitor without authentication. I think users have much more reliable and secure means for viewing the configuration they've deployed to their own servers than anything we'd add insecurely to the monitor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1095683891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1095707949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2612#issuecomment-1095707949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2612","id":1095707949,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5BTy0t","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T23:55:28Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T23:55:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Okay, I fixed the issue with the test breaking.
