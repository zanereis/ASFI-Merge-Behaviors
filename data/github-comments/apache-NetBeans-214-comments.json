You can try to fallback to OpenGL Rendering (see last paragraph of issue description):\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8284381\r\n\r\nWhen launching NetBeans pass `-J-Dsun.java2d.metal=false` or `-J-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true` to the launcher. (the `-J` prefix instructs it to pass the arguments to the underlying java launcher).\r\n\r\nBut I repeat: Your JDK is not current, so this might already be fixed.

Exclusions I've kept for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2226852476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2226890687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7565#issuecomment-2226890687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7565","id":2226890687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Eu6e_","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-13T12:54:58Z","updated_at":"2024-07-13T12:54:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> We may also have to keep in mind the option to revert to 3.2.5 for NB23 given #7560\r\n\r\n@neilcsmith-net yep, had the same thought.

looking at this afresh on my computer rather than trying to make sense of the test trace on my phone, I realised the dependency on the Window API is there.  The problem seems to be the lack of a window manager token.  I'm pretty sure this isn't required, but was added by the APISupport TopComponent wizard and I hadn't realised.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/apisupport/apisupport.wizards/src/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/ui/wizard/winsys/NewTCIterator.java#L321\r\n\r\nWhereas the window API arch docs say \"You might use `OpenIDE-Module-Requires: org.openide.windows.WindowManager` but it is not generally done. \"\r\n\r\nLonger term we could if necessary move the default (Swing) dashboard displayer into a separate module.  But hopefully this fixes the immediate issue.  @sdedic the API itself doesn't rely on Swing, aside from actions, so an alternative displayer could be used in the VSCode plugin in future, should there be interest in exposing any widgets added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2227990711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2228005652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7566#issuecomment-2228005652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7566","id":2228005652,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6EzKsU","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-15T08:55:46Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T08:55:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@neilcsmith-net Maybe dashboard could `OpenIDE-Module-Recommends` the WindowManager token.
