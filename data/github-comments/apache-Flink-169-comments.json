Furthermore, the union aspect may (or may not) happen at restore time, but not at the time that a user requests this state. For what this currently does, I think `ReplicatingState` describes it pretty well. Broadcast would be a good description from the operator's perspective: it broadcasts the generated data to all peers on restore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287326820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287327751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3508#issuecomment-287327751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3508","id":287327751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzMyNzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T11:10:39Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T11:10:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StefanRRichter

for opening this pull request. Adding a `CompositeStateHandle` and a `StateRegistry` is a good idea.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n\r\n  - What do you think about making the `StateRegistry` into a `SharedStateRegistry` which only contains the handles to state that is shared across checkpoints? State that is exclusive to a checkpoint is not handled by that registry, but remains only in the checkpoint. That way we \"isolate\" the existing behavior against the coming changes and do not risk regressions in the state cleanup code (which is very critical for current users).\r\n\r\n  - Another reason for the above suggestion is to also bring some other code into place that has some \"fast paths\" and \"safety nets\" for checkpoint cleanups (currently only with non-shared state), for example dropping a checkpoint simply by a `rm -r` (see https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3522 ). We have seen that for various users the state cleanup problems are among the biggest problems they have, which we can address very well with the work started in the above linked pull request. These things would work together seamlessly if the registry deals only with shared state handles.\r\n\r\n  - I am wondering if it is easier to put the registry into the checkpoint coordinator rather than the checkpoint stores.

Good question, Here I glad share why I notice this method：\r\nWhen we try to implement OVER window TableAPI, The first version of the prototype to achieve，we do not consider the table field will be out of order when we implement translateToPlan method，then we set outputRow field from inputRow according to the Initial order of the table field index.\r\nAt the beginning, the projections in the select statement less than 5 columns It works well.But Unfortunately when the count of projections bigger than 4 (>=5), we got the random result. Then we debug the code, we find that ProjectionTranslator # identifyFieldReferences method uses theSet temporary save field, when the number of elements in the Set is less than 5, the Set takes the Se1, Se2, Se3, Se4 data structures. When the number of elements is greater than or equal to 5, the Set takes HashSet # HashTrieSet and which will cause the data to be out of order. So we thought 2 approach to solve this problem：\r\n\r\nLet ProjectionTranslator # identifyFieldReferences method guaranteed the order of the extracted field references same as input order.\r\nWe add the input and output field mapping.\r\nAt last we using approach#2 solve the problem. This change is not necessary for the problem i have faced. But I feel it is better to let the output of this method in the same order as the input, it may be very helpful for other cases, though I am currently not aware of any. I am ok with not making this change, but we should add a comment instead to highlight that the potential output of the current output. Otherwise, some people may not pay attention to this and assume it is in order.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSunJincheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287505523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287510699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3525#issuecomment-287510699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3525","id":287510699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzUxMDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"WangTaoTheTonic","id":5276001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzYwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5276001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic","html_url":"https://github.com/WangTaoTheTonic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-18T02:35:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-18T02:35:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right...I have same thought as you at the beginning and i've tried to make the move atomic but it has serveral side affect, like:\r\n1. if we use this way to handle this, which means two job can share the same jar file in blobserver, it will be a problem when one of them being canceled and deleting its jars(now it seems like it doesn't do the delete, but it should do)\r\n2. for job recovery(or other kind of recovery, i'm not sure, just observed the phenomenon) blob server will upload jars to hdfs using same name of local file.

I will update the PR as suggested.\r\n* I think it's a good idea that we make the `StateRegistry` into `SharedStateRegistry`.  That will need (1) the state handle must not discard registered objects in the `discardState` method and (2) the state handle has to register shared object once it is received by the coordinator (now the state handle does not register their objects before its checkpoint completes).\r\n* Now that state handles have to register their objects once they are received by the coordinator, we should move `SharedStateRegister` from `CompletedCheckpointStore` to `CheckpointCoordinator`.\r\n* It's better for `StateRegistry` directly discard an object once its reference count is 0. I used a list to collect discarded objects because I want to make the changes in the discarding of completed checkpoint as few as possible.

I would suggest that the shared state handle has a method `String getKey()` (or `Object getKey()`) which gives the unique identifier of the shared state. The `SharedStateRegistry` internally could use something like a `Map<String, SharedStateHandleAndRefCount>`. I think that would give us a bit more flexibility in how we describe \"equality of shared state\": we don't need to make sure that the state handles themselves implement `equals()` such that it meets the semantics of the shared state registry. In the case we have currently, the `getKey()` method could return the normalized path of the file.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287727890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287728689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3535#issuecomment-287728689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3535","id":287728689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzcyODY4OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T10:59:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T10:59:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can not really assess what this change is doing in detail, meaning how it affects typical workloads.

for reminding, @uce 😃 Already had this on my list.\r\n\r\nThe only code that reads the DEFAULT_PARALLELISM from the config should be in this piece of code in `CliFrontend`: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-clients/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/client/CliFrontend.java#L250. Here, we should check whether the user directly specified a parallelism and if not read the one from the config. From there the parameter is already passed to `ClusterClient.run()` where a a `ContextEnvironmentFactory` is being created. In `ContextEnvironmentFactory.createExecutionEnvironment()` we would thus have this parallelism.\r\n\r\nThe question now is whether to keep the `lastEnvCreated.setParallelism(defaultParallelism)` or pass the default parallelism to the `ContextEnvironment` so that the `StreamExecutionEnvironment` can pick it up from there in the constructor. The problem with calling `env.setParallelism()` is that the default parallelism will be \"forgotten\" if the user calls `env.setParallelism(PARALLELISM_DEFAULT)` where `ExecutionConfig.PARALLELISM_DEFAULT == -1`. If we manually store the default parallelism in an extra field we would keep it. This seems to be the nicer solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287751087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287751563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3567#issuecomment-287751563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3567","id":287751563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Nzc1MTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T12:58:17Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T12:58:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you describe what rules this style actually enforces?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287751563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287754339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3521#issuecomment-287754339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3521","id":287754339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Nzc1NDMzOQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T13:10:58Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T13:10:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, thanks.

In general, I like the decoupling of failover handling from the execution graph.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\n  - How about we rename the `FailoverCoordinator` to `FailoverStrategy`?\r\n\r\n  - We should probably implement one very simple failover strategy (restart all) and one better one (failover region based). That has the advantage of having a default implementation that is simple and robust (same as now) for all conservative users.\r\n\r\n  - I would suggest to let commands like `fail()` and `cancel()` that go directly to the `ExecutionGraph` stay on the execution graph.

Because of this issue and because a WindowFunction does not support any kind of pre-aggregation, I think that a WindowFunction is not the right approach to implement this type of OVER windows. For example an over window of 1 hour range would aggregate the whole hour for each row over and over again.\r\n\"\r\n\r\n=> i am not sure there is any other design/option better than this. We could use:\r\n-> processing function - see my comments before\r\n-> we could use window.aggregates (as you suggested to JIRA 5653). There are 2 issues with this: 1) when implementing distinct an the like we still do not have access to the whole data structure ; 2) aggregates is done mainly for supporting just aggregates...which means that in order to support carrying also the contents of the last element (as required by how calcite optimizes the query) you need to artificially create another state-full aggregator to remember the last element (LastElementAggregate) to carry the data - see the solution from @stefanobortoli in 5653 - i feel this is an indication that the design is not the right one either\r\n->we could use windows...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/287999186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288010296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3581#issuecomment-288010296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3581","id":288010296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODAxMDI5Ng==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T08:38:38Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T08:38:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288010296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288010522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3582#issuecomment-288010522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3582","id":288010522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODAxMDUyMg==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T08:39:41Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T08:39:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome guide!

I start also to see a problem with the overall design based on ProcessFunction which make window object obsolete.  FLINK-5572 proposes a solution to avoid memory duplication in Window which in my opinion are better tools. Perhaps we could look into that direction to improve memory efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't even see the need for eager aggregation, as the \"between X and current row\" will not include millions of element, but it is likely to be used with relatively small ranges (10^2?).  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I will look into the ProcessFunction although I have feeling we are making our way through the overall SQL implementation more complex as we move complexity in the aggregation rather than window semantics. Of course these are my2c, and if ProcessFunction works better I will implement it.
