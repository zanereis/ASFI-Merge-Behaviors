I liked how Zipkin 1.x did this with the [ca/sa constants](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin/blob/2.10.0/zipkin/src/main/java/zipkin/Constants.java#L199).  The UI [had some logic](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin/blob/1.31.3/zipkin-ui/js/component_ui/traceSummary.js#L63) for determining which tag/annotation was the most authoritative and would show that.  I honestly miss that as we used the SA annotation to differentiate our DB calls from our HTTP calls.  Now everything has our web service as the name.\r\n\r\nSo your solution could be as simple as this: add a \"magic tag\" which acts as an override for the service name.  Whatever you put in it is what you put in it.

The neat thing here is that it was ordered which meant you could reason with scopes.. For example if something is at a scope smaller than IP, there would be data beyond the IP field\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-retired-htrace/blob/master/htrace-core4/src/main/java/org/apache/htrace/core/TracerId.java#L36\r\n\r\nThis however implied a partial string query to implement. Also, different instrumentation may define this tag differently, which could complicate the ability to reason beyond the IP address.\r\n\r\nSince the original request here was to make IP and port visible, and we already have that data in span.localEndpoint, we settled on a design that is easy to implement and doesn't require changing instrumentation or existing data to achieve (unless for some reason instrumentation didn't add IP in their data which could happen also)\r\n\r\nThere will be different usability stories, relating to site-specifics, where other mechanisms could make more sense. For example, a site could define something not in our model, like a special tag. I would think of this as a separate activity from how to present IP/port information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/484765483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/484766214","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2512#issuecomment-484766214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2512","id":484766214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDc2NjIxNA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-19T04:46:01Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T04:46:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"<img width=\"965\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-19 at 1 41 54 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64215/56405869-42218980-62a9-11e9-96e2-1294bd04e7f6.png\">\r\n\r\nHere's the screen shot showing what we discussed at the workshop.

have a decision to make about group IDs based on this valid comment from @devinsba https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin/pull/2517#discussion_r277020346\r\n\r\nRight now, the change moves things into o.a.z.zipkin2 like so\r\n```diff\r\n-  <groupId>io.zipkin.zipkin2</groupId>\r\n+  <groupId>org.apache.zipkin.zipkin2</groupId>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would mean there is no artifact in `org.apache.zipkin`, rather each repo has a subpath underneath. We could choose the main repo to put its assets under `org.apache.zipkin` directly. This would look neater at the moment. there's a future consideration though. When we make an api incompatible change, we'd want to make a `org.apache.zipkin.zipkin3` at that point, so that old and new classes could co-exist. In other words, it might only be temporarily the case that we could use the root directory `org.apache.zipkin`.\r\n\r\nIf we choose to not use `org.apache.zipkin`, we have choice of `org.apache.zipkin.zipkin2` (to match now) or `org.apache.zipkin.zipkin` (to remove the 2 since there's no ambiguity, yet).\r\n\r\nThis mainly affects java people, but it also affects download urls for the zipkin server jar.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/485052366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/485052482","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2520#issuecomment-485052482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2520","id":485052482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA1MjQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T02:42:45Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T02:42:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks very much!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/485052482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/485054186","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2513#issuecomment-485054186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2513","id":485054186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA1NDE4Ng==","user":{"login":"devinsba","id":139938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTkzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/139938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba","html_url":"https://github.com/devinsba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinsba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T03:15:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T03:15:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Having thought about it a bit more, my updated opinion would be that the library artifacts (those that are reusable, probably not the starters) are `org.apache.zipkin.zipkin2` but everything else is `org.apache.zipkin`.
