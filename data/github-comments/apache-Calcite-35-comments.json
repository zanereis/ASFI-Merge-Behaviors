in fact, I need to refactor a lot on this PR. \r\n\r\nI ignored one biggest fact, which caused my implementation wrong in some places.\r\n\r\nBasically, I believe, per reading EnumerableMergeJoin implementation, it will\r\n1) construct key selector based on ordering of left join keys and right join keys.\r\n2) construct key comparator by `keys must be sorted in ascending order, nulls last`: https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/adapter/enumerable/EnumerableMergeJoin.java#L306.\r\n\r\nThis implementation limits traits propagation in EnumerableMergeJoin to \r\n1. Collations that is constructed for join (not the required one, but the one we want to construct) must have the same ordering as join keys.\r\n2. Collations must be in ascending order, null last\r\n\r\nSo I think based on this understanding, even the exact key matching is not correct:\r\n1. violates the second requirement. \r\n2. just consider orderless case so not following join key's ordering.\r\n\r\nHowever, the most useful way is, EnumerableMergeJoin construct key selector and key comparator based on collations. \r\n\r\n@hsyuan do you agree?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/643722774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/643723354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2026#issuecomment-643723354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2026","id":643723354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzcyMzM1NA==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-14T06:02:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-14T06:02:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`overwrite` is a too broad option name.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure the option works from the command line, and it is documented as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/643723354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/643772611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2006#issuecomment-643772611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2006","id":643772611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Mzc3MjYxMQ==","user":{"login":"hsyuan","id":15352793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzUyNzkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15352793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/hsyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-14T14:16:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-14T14:16:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Physical properties depends on how is the physical implementation algorithms. e.g. For hashjoin, we can't deliver or require the collation out of build side.
