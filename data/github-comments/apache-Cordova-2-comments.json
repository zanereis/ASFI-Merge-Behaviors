the description of this issue:\r\n\r\n> we actually _still_ need to either copy or preferably link `<PROJECT>/node_modules/cordova-<PLATFORM>/node_modules` to `<PROJECT>/platforms/<PLATFORM>/node_modules` _if the former exists_. Otherwise Node's module resolution would not pick up the correct dependency versions for the platform in case of version conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe recent PRs by @erisu seem to ignore this fact. This is mandatory to not break module resolution. Or did you consider this and I am mistaken here? IMO, we need something like this in the create scripts:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ROOT is the platform module root\r\nconst platformDependencies = path.join(ROOT, 'node_modules');\r\n\r\nif (fs.existsSync(platformDependencies)) {\r\n  const localPlatformDependencies = path.join(project_path, 'cordova/node_modules');\r\n  fs.ensureSymlinkSync(platformDependencies, localPlatformDependencies, 'junction');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should fix things until we find time to do it the right way (just my opinion):\r\n> In the long run, we should probably try to have only native projects in `platforms` and keep the platforms' build scripts in the project's `node_modules` and run them from there. That should make things easier and cleaner IMHO.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/437362934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/437981352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/32#issuecomment-437981352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/32","id":437981352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzk4MTM1Mg==","user":{"login":"dpogue","id":241708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTcwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue","html_url":"https://github.com/dpogue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpogue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T18:23:32Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T18:23:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There are a bunch of similar-sounding problems here, and I think you've identified one and @erisu handled one, but they're not quite the same problem and it probably makes sense to try to identify all the problems:\r\n\r\n1. **Existing released platforms need their node_modules copied when installing with the CLI**\r\n  This *should* already happen, because the copy command is unconditionally in their project create scripts.\r\n\r\n2. **Existing released platforms need their node_modules copied when installing using `bin/create` from a tarball**\r\n  This is currently broken because the tarballs don't include node_modules, but I think it's out of our current scope to try to fix this for existing releases.\r\n\r\n3. **Current platforms do not need their node_modules copied because they should match the CLI**\r\n  But it's not safe to rely on this, which is what I believe @raphinesse is pointing out. See case 5 below.\r\n\r\n4. **Current platforms need their node_modules copied when installing using `bin/create` from a tarball**\r\n  @erisu fixed part of this by ensuring that the bin/create scripts will include the command to copy node_modules. One problem that still exists is that the tarball releases on dist don't actually include node_modules, but that's probably also out of scope for this particular discussion (it should, however, get raised for discussion in terms of our release process).\r\n\r\n5. **Current platforms with a future CLI (or vice versa) need their node_modules copied when installing with the CLI**\r\n  This is @raphinesse's point, that is the complication in case 3. If we install an older platform, its dependencies might not match the versions used by the CLI, so we would need to copy the nested node_modules folder to ensure we don't break module resolution.\r\n\r\nThe PRs from @erisu solve part of case 4, but we probably need to always copy node_modules if they exist to handle case 5.\r\n\r\nAre there any additional edge cases that I've missed?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDoing this \"the right way\", and running the platform API scripts from the node_modules folder itself is definitely something we should eventually try to move towards, but

everything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/437981352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/438237090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/46#issuecomment-438237090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/46","id":438237090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODIzNzA5MA==","user":{"login":"janpio","id":183673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio","html_url":"https://github.com/janpio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T11:42:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T11:42:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Possible

I would like to have better control over when it updates the behavior of cordova.js. For example, the master branch of cordova-js has changes to remove browserify, with version 5.0.0-dev, which I think is not wanted in a patch release. I have my own fork, with changes in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/pull/188> (WIP PR) that I can use to generate from a specific cordova-js version but find this whole step to be a bit clumsy and non-intuitive.\r\n* cordova-coho seems to make the updates in multiple commits. While it would be straightforward for a developer to squash the commits I find this to be clumsy as well.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that we can set the desired version number in one place, and the scripts would generate the platform files with the right version numbers __whenver the user does `cordova platform add`__. I think this should be very straightforward with help from existing npm packages. I can raise a PR to demonstrate this idea if desired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/439985835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/439989457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/50#issuecomment-439989457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/50","id":439989457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTk4OTQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"janpio","id":183673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio","html_url":"https://github.com/janpio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T18:12:43Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T18:18:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

A recent example is <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/7534>, which they landed in <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/commit/405e8d3710b518f36d026a619e16e59775d7b971>. (Earlier PouchDB PRs such as <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/2900> were actually closed rather than merged since the GitHub merge tool was less advanced back then. And Node.js still seems to close accepted PRs with \"landed\" messages instead of actually merging them; <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23163> is an example.)\r\n\r\nI am starting to favor keeping the PR number at the end, like GitHub does by default, to make things easier.

For example, this was never a part of the original roadmap or even a hint as future work.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as @dpogue commented \r\n> I don't think this actually requires anything more than a patch release\r\n\r\nSince we are pining `cordova-common@^3.0.0` and we do not commit `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` (for most packages) this means the the patch released would take affect immediately without releasing new tools.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/448204591/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/449807018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/10#issuecomment-449807018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/10","id":449807018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTgwNzAxOA==","user":{"login":"erisu","id":1029107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjkxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu","html_url":"https://github.com/erisu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-25T05:59:07Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T07:44:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**Stage 2 Progress Report:**\r\n\r\nThe following tools and template has been published and its corresponding [release blog post](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2018/12/25/tools-release.html) has also been posted.\r\n- cordova-app-hello-world@4.0.0\r\n- cordova-fetch@2.0.0\r\n- cordova-js@5.0.0\r\n- cordova-serve@3.0.0\r\n\r\nI am planning to begin with stage 3 after winter vacation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/449807018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/449807454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/10#issuecomment-449807454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/10","id":449807454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTgwNzQ1NA==","user":{"login":"erisu","id":1029107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjkxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu","html_url":"https://github.com/erisu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-25T06:02:53Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T06:19:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@brodybits Have you finished preparing the `cordova-node-xcode@2.0.0` release?
