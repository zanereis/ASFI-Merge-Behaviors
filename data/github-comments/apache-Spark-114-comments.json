That's closer in behavior to always creating a new `Thread`. You may still get loads of simultaneous threads and may not save many allocations.\n\nCapping the number of threads helps those two factors (why wouldn't the max pool size have effect?) but at some level this means this may block when the executor is busy. Right now the no-arg `LinkedBlockingQueue` will go on accepting work until it has 2 billion entries, if the executor can't keep up. This is probably not ideal, and should be capped at something more reasonable. Not sure if the possibility of blocking the thread that invokes the task is a problem or not.\n\nHow about setting the max pool size, and queue capacity, to a value that is deemed quite large? like, you never want more than 1000 threads and 100K tasks queued?

Mark, one comment on this (also discussed over email): instead of setting the uncaught exception handler of the Akka thread we happen to run in, it might be better to wrap these in a try/catch, and the easiest way to do it would be to add a `Utils.tryOrExit(block: => Unit)` that goes through the same code paths as here on exceptions. What do you think? It will be more verbose but it will limit the chance of this uncaught exception handler breaking other stuff (though in normal operation we shouldn't be randomly getting exceptions AFAIK).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42352943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42353112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/663#issuecomment-42353112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/663","id":42353112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzUzMTEy","user":{"login":"sryza","id":654855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza","html_url":"https://github.com/sryza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-06T20:17:11Z","updated_at":"2014-05-06T20:17:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, misunderstood how ThreadPoolFactory worked.\n\nTo take a step back, we expect to have a burst (max low thousands) of executors to run at the beginning of an application.  Then the only time we'll use the thread pool is when executors fail and we need to start new ones.\n\nSo the behavior we want is to be able to scale the pool up to a large number of threads, and then shrink it after the initial burst is done.  We'd probably like to limit this number of threads at some number, but keep queueing up containers to start.\n\nI think the right solution is probably to create a pool with a large core size (500?), and then, after the initial containers are launched, bring this down to something more manageable like 10.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42353112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42353831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/663#issuecomment-42353831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/663","id":42353831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzUzODMx","user":{"login":"sryza","id":654855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza","html_url":"https://github.com/sryza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-06T20:23:21Z","updated_at":"2014-05-06T20:23:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Or,

don't necessarily need to start with 500 threads.   In the very least it should be configurable.  In our tests of MR we found that 500 threads didn't actually help, we found that 10's worked just fine (20-30), even when launching thousands of tasks.  If you actually get 500 threads it can cause memory issues.  I guess if we have them timeout quicker it might not be as much of an issues (I believe MR's timeout is high), but I would like to see it a config just in case it is.  Also 1 second might be a bit to short if you actually want to reuse them as the AM heartbeats to the RM every 5 seconds, so if you get one round launch them, heartbeat back in, it will have shutdown those threads even though it could reuse them.  \n\n@srowen  See the javadoc on the ThreadPoolExecutor about LInkedBlockingQueue:\n\nUnbounded queues. Using an unbounded queue (for example a LinkedBlockingQueue without a predefined capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize therefore doesn't have any effect.) This may be appropriate when each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server. While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on average faster than they can be processed.\n\nAlso perhaps adding a comment there to explain it would be good as its easy to miss that max isn't used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42362724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42365720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/671#issuecomment-42365720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/671","id":42365720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzY1NzIw","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-06T22:02:58Z","updated_at":"2014-05-06T22:02:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can
