this normal? Should this errors recover automatically?\r\n- Do we need the 3 bookies in the ensemble up and running for us to recover from these errors? If so, what happens if we loose one bookie forever?\r\n- From broker side, is there something to do to handle better these errors? we're left with a bunch of consumers or topics not being able to
