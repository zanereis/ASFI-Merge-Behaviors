But what if there was an error in the index, and the error is fixed? As I read the code, the diagnostics will not be refreshed?\r\n\r\nCurrently - the refresh is done in the following way: For the file being modified, the diagnostics are updated with each modification via LSP ‘textDocument/diagnostic’ requests. After the modified document is saved - it is re-indexed (`ErrorsNotifier` gets started searches for all files in index with errors and recompute their diagnostic). After that the second round of re-indexing starts with all dependent files and files with error (which removes errors from the index for files that were transitively fixed with the change in the original file).\r\n \r\n>     * what if there will be a lot of files with errors? Will this try to open the Document for all of them, and do full diagnostic run for them, parsing&attributing in the process?\r\n\r\nYou are right - currently it does the full diagnostic run for all files marked as erroneous including parsing&attributing in the process. If it turns out to harm the overall performance of the extension, it can be rewritten to publish the diagnostic directly form the caches.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2328802433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2328967621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6652#issuecomment-2328967621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6652","id":2328967621,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6K0TnF","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-04T13:01:01Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T13:01:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I didn't know, that this view renders MD, I just noticed HTML.

This will happen only if the root has already been recognized, so it should not alter cases where source file launcher is not used.\r\n\r\nI checked it and I think it does not work. Here is what I did:\r\n\r\n1. Build NetBeans from this branch\r\n2. Place breakpoints in `MultiSourceRootProvider.java`, lines 110 and 164\r\n3. Remove `nbbuild/testuserdir`\r\n4. Run \"Debug\" from the \"Java File Launcher\" project\r\n5. Enable \"Java SE\" in the Plugin manager\r\n6. Ensure there is a \"test.java\" file in your home directory\r\n7.  Open \"Favorites\" tab\r\n8. Expand the \"Home\" node\r\n\r\nThe breakpoint in line 164 is hit with the home directory as `root`. The letting the IDE continue running the breakpoint in line 110 is hit, reporting `true` for my home directory.\r\n\r\nI did not use the source file launcher, yet the file and the directory are now recognized.\r\n\r\nWhat is more I see similar reports as @mbien.
