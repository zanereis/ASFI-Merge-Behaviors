truth, I'm not opposed to a mechanism _like_ `PipelineOptions` to provide global settings during pipeline construction, but that won't actually solve the problem.

It is not part of the definition of a trigger for a user. So `OnceTrigger` and `Trigger` exist in the SDK when you are building a pipeline, and the SDK handles validation there. When that pipeline arrives for execution, you don't have to keep track of it.\r\n\r\nSeparate from that, I do believe that we should eliminate the `OnceTrigger` conceptually, since it is a risk of data loss.
