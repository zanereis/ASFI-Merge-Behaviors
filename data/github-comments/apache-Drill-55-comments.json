The issue as you mentioned is because we are loading the response from server in same page. I guess the reason for that is because any error in query on server side is also send as a HTTP success response. So we just chose to update the /query page with either actual result or exception from server side. Please consider below 2 options:\r\n\r\n1) Create a single `queryResult.ftl` page or repurpose `result.ftl` page, now on server side based on success or failure we populate it with either result.ftl or errorMessage.ftl template. In this way the form on /query page can always be directed to load /queryResult.ftl page (I guess using the `action` property)\r\n2) Somehow in success handler of ajax post request get the response page URL and load that url with the response data. Or may be use redirection mechanism to load the result page.

If the file contains the pattern `\\\"` or `\"\"`, then the text reader will produce a different result than previously.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, please do point me to the errors and I'll track down the issues.

The were not public for the log format plugin, so I changed them to {{public}} to get the above query to work.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the code in [`FormatPluginOptionsDescriptor.createConfigForTable()`](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/store/dfs/FormatPluginOptionsDescriptor.java#L123), we'll see that there is nothing that would handle the `values` syntax suggested in your note.

This failed due to the unfortunate use of \"schema\" as plugin property name. You've pointed out this issue all along, I finally understood why it was a problem. Still, I'm reluctant to change the config property name for fear of breaking compatibility.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, this limitation is only a minor nuisance since the only reason to combine the two kinds of table functions is to specify the regex property. A unit test shows that the regex can be specified as a table property instead.\r\n\r\nAlso, went ahead and added support for the `columns` column. If no schema is provided (not in the plugin config, not in a table function, not in a provided schema), then rather than creating a set of dummy fields `field_0`, `field_1`, etc., the plugin how follows the text format plugin and puts the fields into the `columns` array. The dummy fields are still used if the user specifies at least one column schema, but the regex has more groups than specified columns.\r\n\r\nThis means that, if the user uses a table function to specify just the regex, the user gets a reasonable result: the fields come back in the `columns` array.\r\n\r\nUnit tests show the new `columns` array support.

@arina-ielchiieva, for pointing me to the Parquet data sources. As it turns out, these failures are quite a mystery.\r\n\r\nFirst, I don't think the files you mentioned are those used by the tests that failed. The set stored on GitHub is for scale factor (SF) 0.1 which has 1500 customers in the customer table with ids from 0 to 1499. The tests seem to use SF1 which, perhaps, is generated by the test framework during its setup. If we look at the union03 query, the expected results include customer IDs in the six-digit range.\r\n\r\nThat said, I did recreate the union03 query locally, using the SF0.1 files and got 3 result rows. To verify, I wrote a test that scanned the entire table (just a `SELECT * FROM ...`), and \"manually\" applied the where clause. Three rows matched. So, looks like, at least locally, that particular query works OK against the SF0.1 data set.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't check the contents of the `customer.parquet` file because I can't get Parquet tools to work after several hours of fighting one thing after another. I seem to recall we discussed bundling that tool with Drill. Doing so would be very handy. Building by hand requires far more steps than is documented in the Parquet and HortonWorks web site: 1) install gcc, 2) download and compile thrift, 3) build Parquet-tools, 4) figure out the set of dependent jars that must be on the class path, 5)... not sure, here is where I gave up in frustration...\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, I'm actually completely mystified at how my changes could impact Parquet (only). This PR only changed source files are for the \"new\" scan, which Parquet does not use. Oddly, none of the text file queries fail; which is the one area I *did* change.\r\n\r\nWere the parquet files used in the tests rebuilt recently? Might there be a problem with the data itself?\r\n\r\nJust to make sure I'm tracking down the correct issue: does the master branch pass these same tests? Using the same data files (that is, using the same cluster without rebuilding the functional tests?) Perhaps try testing the log regex or mock PRs.

very sorry for the trouble that PR has caused. Thank you for the SF1 data. It allowed me to find the offending change and fix the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is a case of \"no good deed goes unpunished.\" I tried to work around the bad code explained in DRILL-7308 by setting precision only if non-zero. For reasons I did not track down, this change caused some part of the TPC-H queries to fail.\r\n\r\nThe failure was in the \"tuple/column metadata\" classes. I had not realized that these classes are now used outside of just the new scan and schema work. (I did not track down the usage.)\r\n\r\nThis exercise shows that Drill requires the following rules regarding precision:\r\n\r\n* Precision must be set for all types that need it (including VarChar and Decimal.)\r\n* Precision must be set for these types even if the value is zero.\r\n* Code that wants to know if the precision is non-zero should check the precision value itself. Code should not use an \"is set\" check as a substitute for \"value != 0\". (This is the flaw in the REST code described in DRILL-7308.)\r\n\r\nFiled DRILL-7318 to suggest we clean up and standardize our type-to-string implementations so that they build type strings based on the above rules.\r\n\r\nReverted the precision-related change in {{PrimitiveColumnMetadata}}. The TPC-H union03 query now passes locally. I presume the others will also.\r\n\r\nThe reversion caused a test to fail. It seems that the `EXPLAIN PLAN` for the new schema provisioning stuff uses the `toString()` method to get the type string shown in the plan for a provided schema. Not sure this is the best idea because `toString()` is for debugging and uses internal type names. It also shows the precision and scale for all types, resulting in the output `INT(0, 0):OPTIONAL`. (The type names and cardinality notation should be fixed as part of DRILL-7318.)\r\n\r\nThe reverted change had removed the unwanted precision and scale. By reverting the change, the unwanted precision and scale returned. So, for now, I modified `MaterializedField.toString()` to not emit the precision if the value is zero (unless the type is Decimal.) `EXPLAIN PLAN` now produces `INT:OPTIONAL` (without the precision and scale.)\r\n\r\nLeft the changes as a new commit so you can review just the new changes.\r\n\r\nPlease try this PR again against the functional tests. Let's hope this time things work this time. If so, I'll squash commits. We talked about creating a merge branch with the three open PRs. Since you need to run the functional tests again to verify the fix, do you want to then just commit this PR? I can create a merge branch for the other two. Otherwise, I'm happy to create a merge branch with all three.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/508966464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/508995549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1823#issuecomment-508995549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1823","id":508995549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODk5NTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-07T12:23:46Z","updated_at":"2019-07-07T12:23:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vvysotskyi and @paul-rogers thanks for code review.

Before explaining the problem, let me answer your questions and make the idea clear:\r\n\r\n1. The purpose of this change is to enable support for openssl 1.1.0/1.1.1. This requires updating boost (to at least 1.64). So, I updated boost to the latest - 1.68. But, then I ran into problems with building using travis (as explained later) and I started experimenting with other versions of boost to see if the issue can be resolved. Thats why you see 1.65 there in the change. Ideally it should be 1.68.\r\n\r\n2. Agreed, the changes in travis.yml are only experiments to get the build pass. Will explain the problem shortly.\r\n\r\n3. Boost API has changed. The argument now needs to be passed by reference. This is the main purpose of the change. Without the change drill client code would not compile with boost 1.68.\r\n\r\nNow, the problem. To get travis to build drill client code I would have to specify the location for downloading the boost 1.68 static libs. I could not find a repo from where I can do this and hence the change in the travis.yml file is not accurate. One option is to build boost from source but that would unnecessarily slow down the build. I also tried other boost versions (1.65, 1.67) but travis build did not succeed. Not sure how to proceed from here now.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/509622674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/510800641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1817#issuecomment-510800641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1817","id":510800641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDgwMDY0MQ==","user":{"login":"dgrinchenko","id":49441223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDQxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49441223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrinchenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrinchenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T08:31:01Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T08:31:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@debraj92 please read carefully point 2 of my comment, it describes why travis failing for you.
