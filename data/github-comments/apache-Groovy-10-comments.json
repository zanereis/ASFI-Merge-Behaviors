\n- The name \"maxAllowedValue\" is confusing, since this may be a minimum, something like \"limit\" might work better\n- Not sure how to reuse these methods for a lazy / streaming approach of reading n steps and then aborting prematurely (like StepIterator inner class in ObjectRange)\n- 2nd Exception should include feedback information about the values used\n- the code path at the bottom half of step when (initialValue == maxAllowedValue and step!=0) looks dodgy and overly complicated, seems to me the final loop will never execute in that case, so code could return early in that case\n- inclusive / exclusive limit distinction not yet there\n- Not sure if initialValue, limit and step have all to be of same generic type T\n- Not sure if while loop with comparison each time might be safely optimized by calculating how many numbers should be passed to closure, saving the time of comparisons (safely means rounding errors safe). \n- Note that adding step n times is also prone to some rounding \"influence\" compared to adding (i \\* step) to initialValue in the loop (many rounding errors for each addition vs. 2 rounding errors (1 multiplication and 1

of all, sorry, that there has been no communication about this for such a long time. One reason this is open for that long is, because the solution is not really satisfying and a better solution is lacking. I think we could go with the property idea, but only testing once... similar to for example file.encoding. I would not go the route of allowing changes to the format encoding at runtime after first use. I would especially not do anything with ThreadLocal if not absolutely required. If we require a change at runtime I think the category usage might not be the right thing to do for this. Then I think we would need a different solution as a new feature.

I merged in the less controversial commits to reduce some noise.\n\nAs a general comment, we don't have a strict preference for adding \"final\" everywhere. It used to be the case that we'd have strongly encouraged it. It is after all a statement of programmer intent and used to be a great hint to the compiler. But it does make the code slightly more noisy and the compiler is now usually smart enough to work out when it can optimize things regardless of the keyword. One take is that if your code is so complex that you need to have final keywords to help understand what things might change and what doesn't, then you need to refactor to more simple code. We certainly don't take it that far and so don't actively discourage its use when it makes sense. In any case, this is just for background information, not trying to stop you adding them if you feel strongly about them. Some reviewers might love them, others will see it as noise - so best to keep them in separate commits - which is what you did, so thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/229915105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/229918917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/360#issuecomment-229918917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/360","id":229918917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTkxODkxNw==","user":{"login":"l0rinc","id":1841944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDE5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc","html_url":"https://github.com/l0rinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T10:57:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T10:57:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@paulk-asert, I used to have a strong opinion about finals also, but I fully agree with your statement, it's how I view comments also: if you need them to make things more obvious (i.e. whether the values have changed since the declaration), you should probably redesign.\n\nCould you please let me know what you would like me to change for this PR to be merged (again, it's pending for almost 1 year).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/229918917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/229923514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/360#issuecomment-229923514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/360","id":229923514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTkyMzUxNA==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T11:24:25Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T11:24:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, my observations at this point:\n- there seems to be a problem with `IntRange` and decimal step values:\n\n```\n(0..9).step(1.1)\n// => java.lang.ClassCastException: java.math.BigDecimal cannot be cast to java.lang.Long\n```\n- I still think using `StepIterator` (or `LazySteppingIterator`) directly rather than `iterator()` is the way to go internally. Regardless of the performance results of adding in the extra synchronization, it seems better to avoid it when we know it isn't needed.\n- I still wonder about decimal step sizes for non-Numbers. I wonder whether people will be surprised by the following results:\n\n```\ndef r1 = 'a'..'j'\nassert r1.step(1.01) == ['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i']\nassert r1.step(1.99) == ['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i']\n```\n\nand also:\n\n```\ndef r1 = 'a'..'j'\nassert r1.size() == 10\nassert r1.step(1.1).size() == 5\ndef r2 = 0L..9L\nassert r2.size() == 10\nassert r2.step(1.1).size() == 9\n```\n- We also have the breaking change which (if acceptable) would need to be documented. The following script currently executes:\n\n```\nassert (1G..9G).step(2) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\nBigInteger.metaClass.next << { delegate + 2 }\nassert (1G..9G).step(2) == [1, 5, 9]\n```\n\nBut fails after the changes. This is to be expected since we removed the \"reflective\" path and replaced it with an optimized path. In other places in Groovy we do some optimizations like this when we know metaprogramming isn't in play but such checking currently isn't easy to do within the Range classes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/229923514/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/229939908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/360#issuecomment-229939908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/360","id":229939908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTkzOTkwOA==","user":{"login":"l0rinc","id":1841944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDE5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc","html_url":"https://github.com/l0rinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0rinc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T12:58:16Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T12:58:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> it seems better to avoid it when we know it isn't needed\n\nI find it premature optimization, but will accommodate.\n\n> ``` groovy\n> def r1 = 'a'..'j'\n> assert r1.step(1.01) == ['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i']\n> assert r1.step(1.99) == ['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i']\n> ```\n\nNot sure what people would expect to happen in this case, as characters are not numbers? :/\n\n> (0..9).step(1.1)\n\nThanks, my mistake.

Like others, I think a ClassInfo that may or may not reference its corresponding Class is super-prone to surprising errors.\n\nUPDATE: Never mind, guessing that's not actually possible, and weakly referencing Class is probably the next best thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230074174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230090836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/219#issuecomment-230090836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/219","id":230090836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDA5MDgzNg==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-02T08:30:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T08:30:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How do you make for example String reference ClassInfo?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230090836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230093741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/360#issuecomment-230093741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/360","id":230093741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDA5Mzc0MQ==","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-02T09:53:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T09:53:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paulk-asert : \nGenerally we should avoid the word \"step\" for the extension you propose. I recommend the article on ranges in Swift. Ranges represent indexed lists, that can be represented as a list of pairs:\n[(0, a), (1, b), (2, c), ...]. A \"step\" is the distance between 0 and 1 as an example, but you want to introduce a custom distance between \"a\" and \"b\". Maybe call that a \"stride\" instead of a \"step\".\n\nThe abstraction of groovy.lang.Range is based on next() and previous() as \"strides\", meaning for domains where elements have a useful inherent indexing order, a segment within that domain can be represented by a lower and upper boundary. That happens to be useful in the case of Integers, single characters, and little else (some obscure custom domain classes maybe), where the implicit \"stride\" is obvious. Even enums are dubious candidates IMO, because their order is somewhat inexplicit.\n\nYour suggestion is to open this up to a different abstraction, to describe series of elements using a lower boundary, and upper boundary, and a custom stride.\n\nAs mentioned trying to represent such a series may be done outside the scope of groovy Ranges, extending Numbers with a stride function.\n\nA similar way to create number series with a fixed stride is:\n\n```\n(1..9).collect {it * 0.1}   ==    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.9]\n```\n\nIt is more typing and a bit less obvious than\n\n  (0.1..0.9).stride(0.1)   ==    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 0.9]\n\nbut on the other hand the closure notation is way more extensible than a fixed stride Range. In general I would favour teaching Groovy Programmers to avoid any Range unless based on Integers or special custom classes with custom next() and previous() methods, and use the integer-based range + closure instead. The concept of a range simply does not fit much else than integers. In other words, for me, Groovy 3 could ship without the ObjectRange class, as it brings more problems than benefits. It would even be debatable for me if the \"..\" operator is useful enough compared to a mere range function like pythons.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230093741/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230098951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/360#issuecomment-230098951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/360","id":230098951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDA5ODk1MQ==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-02T12:15:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T12:15:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let us go on the concept side and do step-by-step..\n\nDefinition1:\nNormally I would define a range along this: If I have a Range X..Y, then for all i<=Y && i>=X, the Range contains i. And that's it. For this I need compareTo on X,Y as well as a \"contains\" on Range. \n\nThe problem now of course is that the Groovy range is almost never used in this manner, so this clean definition will not do the job. Let us then define the Rang as a List with a lower and upper bound. That makes X, the first element of the list. But how to define the other elements?\n\nDefinition2: use next(). This easily realizes a stepping of 1, not as a numeric value as such, but as one-by-one. Now we can define l_0 as X, and l_1 as l_0.next(). For l_(n+1) we define l_n.next(). To met the old requirement of the range we would also have to have X<=l_i<=Y via compareTo to realize a contains. This still leaves the question of how to handle an i, for which there is no list element, but allows X<=i<=Y. Defining \"contains\" to behave like in the first range definition makes it clear, that there will be nothing clear to the user, if i has to be a list element from a ranges perspective, but that is exactly the definition imposed by List. Leaving that conflict aside a stepping s (of integer type) can be done by multiple executions of next(). A non-int-stepping will not work for this. For ranges based on numbers an optimization could be done by using plus(n), instead of multiple uses of next().\n\nDefinition3: use plus(stepping). So instead of using next, we would here use the plus method as defined through X and Y. l_0 is then still X, l_1 is l_0+stepping. and l_(n+1) = l_n+stepping. This can in theory allow arbitrary steppings, for as long as the plus method allows it. Like before we have a conflict for \"contains\". Again an optimization could be done for number based ranges with l_n = l_0+stepping*n, which requires the definition of multiply of course.\n\nThe aim of this pullrequest (well it got modified so much by now, that talking of \"this\" pullrequest is not really right anymore, but let us leave it at that) seems for me to go in the direction of Definition3, while Definition2, with i having to be a list element for contains, is more of what we use in Groovy now. But it is a big problem for me to realize Definition3 using logic based on \"next\" instead of plus. Something like 'a'..'j'.step(1.1) makes no sense to me. Also plus doesn´t have to take a number as well.... not to forget, that using plus for String based ranges would lead to actually entirely different results than today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230098951/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/230109518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/242#issuecomment-230109518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/242","id":230109518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDEwOTUxOA==","user":{"login":"shils","id":2948884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg4ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils","html_url":"https://github.com/shils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-02T16:14:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T16:14:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agreed,

It has the same bug as this one, just in reverse (weak hash map of ClassValue to stored value, but stored value cannot reference ClassValue).

(Makes me think Java should have a `LinkingReference<A, B>` which, if alive, makes `A` strongly reference `B`, but meh.)\n\nThat said, if I understand correctly, `ClassInfo` will store the `MetaClass` from Groovy, right? Even if we make the `Class<?>` a weak reference, wouldn't adding a strong reference to the `MetaClass` (in Groovy script code) just reproduce the problem? What about a reference to another `Class<?>` from the same classloader as `klazz`?

spike showing an alternative to PR#360. Basically it takes some of the optimizations desired for ObjectRange from that PR but only implements them in a new class NumberRange. It does also change the default class for creating ranges involving two (non-Integer) Numbers to use NumberRange instead of ObjectRange.\n\nThe main thing which is supported is fast calculation of range items rather than relying on next() calls and ranges with a non-integral step size like this:\n\n```\ndef r = (0.1..0.9).by(0.1)\nassert r == [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]\n```\n\nIt is a breaking change in that some weird edge cases involving metaprogramming on Numbers will behave differently. There is a slightly better backwards compatibility story than PR#360 however since users are still free to create ObjectRange's manually if they need the old behavior.\n\nI call it a spike because I still have some questions on the current design. For instance, with ObjectRange we have the following behavior:\n\n```\ndef or = 'a'..<'f'\nassert or.step(2) == ['a', 'c', 'e']\nassert or.step(-2) == ['e', 'c', 'a']\n```\n\nBut currently inclusivity is remembered and applied to the 'to' end of the range when going in different directions, e.g.\n\n```\ndef nr0 = (1..<6).by(2)\nassert nr0.step(1) == [1, 3, 5]\nassert nr0.step(-1) == [6, 4, 2]\n\ndef nr1 = (1..<6).by(-1)\nassert nr1.step(2) == [6, 4, 2]\nassert nr1.step(-2) == [1, 3, 5]\n\ndef nr2 = (1..<6).by(1)\nassert nr2.step(1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nassert nr2.step(-1) == [6, 5, 4, 3, 2]\n```\n\nThis may seem unintuitive at first but is kind of useful once understood. It is also somewhat essential to creating efficient ranges that can be traversed in either direction. But it's not the only possible design. We could brute force calculate the final to value (going in the forward direction) and use that as the from value when iterating in reverse.\n\nAnother question as brought up by @tkruse in an earlier PR was whether for inaccurate number types like float whether it is better to continually add the step values when iterating or multiply by an index - giving at most two rounding errors rather than a compounding scenario. I also haven't tried to fast calculate all possible cases - it might be possible to cover additional cases. But that can be done I believe as a post optimization. It might also be possible to precalculate the number of items within the range during iteration which might save the cost of comparisons for each iteration.\n\nAlso, there are some other optimizations possible. The expression `(0.1..0.9).by(0.1)` creates two NumberRanges. The first with a step size of one, the second with the desired 0.1 step size. This is just a convenience to piggy back on existing syntax features. It would be possible to enhance the compiler to detect cases like that and instead just create a single NumberRange. Again, I consider this an optimization for later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/232311537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/232312636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/360#issuecomment-232312636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/360","id":232312636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjMxMjYzNg==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-13T10:04:18Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T10:04:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paplorinc I created an alternative spike here: PR #366\nSome snippets of the code is borrowed from some of your work but it wasn't possible to mix in any of your commits as a whole.
