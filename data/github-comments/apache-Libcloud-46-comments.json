way to solve this would be to vendor the requests library into libcloud so that we know that there's always a specific version of requests available.\r\n\r\nSince we just discovered that libcloud relies on `requests>2.6.0`, another way to at least surface this problem at install time as opposed to run time would be to specify a minimum version of requests that the library requires.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/515052500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/515102835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1322#issuecomment-515102835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1322","id":515102835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTEwMjgzNQ==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T15:59:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T15:59:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm

a record in Gandi encompasses all values, whereas in Route53 each individual value constitutes a record, and multiple values are a convenience.  So it's possible there to delete one value (record), whereas with Gandi you can only delete all values.  If you want to change the number of values associated with a name-type, you basically have to delete and recreate the record instead of updating it (whereas if you could pass in the new set of values directly, you could just call update).  This `update_record` is still mostly useful just because most records are unlikely to have multiple values, but beyond that you'd have to know something about driver specifics.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/517078453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/517249133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1331#issuecomment-517249133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1331","id":517249133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzI0OTEzMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T11:44:30Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T18:21:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#1331](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331?src=pr&el=desc) into [trunk](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/commit/2b45f76753701fc6f405f35e2c645de035698c3c?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=PYoduksh69&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##            trunk    #1331      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   86.27%   86.27%   +<.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         367      367              \n  Lines       75303    75315      +12     \n  Branches     6886     6886              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        64965    64977      +12     \n  Misses       7561     7561              \n  Partials     2777     2777\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [libcloud/compute/drivers/openstack.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvY29tcHV0ZS9kcml2ZXJzL29wZW5zdGFjay5weQ==) | `84.05% <100%> (+0.05%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/test/compute/test\\_openstack.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9jb21wdXRlL3Rlc3Rfb3BlbnN0YWNrLnB5) | `94.67% <100%> (+0.02%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1331?src=pr&el=footer).
