Will leave as is.\r\n\r\n2) Asked about RexUnknownAs\r\nThat wasn't how the original code exposed this option. I stayed consistent which seems appropriate for an configuration/options object.\r\n\r\n3) Whether consider an ENUM and dislike 3-boolean contstructor\r\nI don't think an enum for every combination of three binary values makes sense. My whole change was to avoid having users interact with constructors that were like that (and why the ReductionOptions constructor is private). This is a basically a builder pattern to make sure the code is easily consumable. On that point, given that we now have three properties, I would assume we may have more in the future thus a builder seems like a much better pattern.\r\n\r\n4) Want to understand when it is important to preserve types\r\nI didn't introduce this functionality so I have no opinions about it. I'm simply trying to make construction of the rule more readable and expose the option: reduction of dynamic functions that was previously not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/449776143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/449876420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/980#issuecomment-449876420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/980","id":449876420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTg3NjQyMA==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-25T22:13:42Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T22:13:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">I don't think an enum for every combination of three binary values makes sense\r\n\r\n@jacques-n , I don't understand why do you have multiple JIRA/PRs for the same code changes.

Using Enums is one way to solve this. Another option is using builder-esque pattern with an options object. I chose the second option because it benefits from being able to have additional options added without further refactoring. The only place where generic booleans are used are internal to the class and everything else is done via immutable builders well defined method names.
