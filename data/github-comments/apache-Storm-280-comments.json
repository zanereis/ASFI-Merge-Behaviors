href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>Sorry, I should have explained. The KafkaConsumer supports subscriptions via two APIs: subscribe() and assign(). subscribe() lets Kafka deal with assigning partitions to each consumer, assign() lets the calling code assign them manually. When I asked if you were using automatic assignment, I meant which of these APIs your spout was using. The default is subscribe().  </p>\n\n<p>I think the subscribe() API doesn't really work when there are multiple consumers in a thread. As far as I can tell, the KafkaConsumer will initiate a partition reassignment whenever a new consumer joins the consumer group. The rebalance seems to require all active consumers to call poll(), and poll() doesn't return until the rebalance is complete. </p>\n\n<p>The problem seems to be that when we run multiple spout tasks in one executor, we end up triggering a rebalance when each consumer joins the group. Since the other consumers in the executor can't call poll until the rebalance is complete, because the newly joined consumer is blocking the thread in poll(), they are booted from the list of active consumers. For the version of Kafka you're running, this will happen once the session.timeout.ms expires (default 30 seconds), at which point the blocking poll() returns. At this point Kafka considers only the newly joined consumer to be alive. When the other tasks in the executor next call poll, they try to rejoin the group, which again causes a rebalance and and reassignment.</p>\n\n<p>The log you posted shows partition reassignment to a new task id every 30 seconds for each executor (look for \"Partitions reassignment.\"). I don't think the subscribe() API was designed with the expectation that one thread might be running multiple consumers.</p>\n\n<p>I attached some test code that starts two KafkaConsumers and repeatedly polls with them. It seems to demonstrate this behavior where the subscribe() API works poorly when there are multiple consumers in a thread. The assignments keep flip flopping between the consumers. With one consumer per thread, or manual assignment through the assign() API, it works fine.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a sample print</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">176 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser - Kafka version : 0.10.0.0\n176 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser - Kafka commitId : b8642491e78c5a13\n176 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Polling from c1\n301 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator - Discovered coordinator DESKTOP-AGC8TKM:9092 (id: 2147483647 rack: <span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>) <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> group test.\n302 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator - Revoking previously assigned partitions [] <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> group test\n302 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Partitions [] revoked <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> c1\n302 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator - (Re-)joining group test\n309 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator - Successfully joined group test with generation 42\n309 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator - Setting newly assigned partitions [topic-0, topic-1] <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> group test\n309 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Partitions [topic-0, topic-1] assigned to c1\n2185 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Polling from c2\n2290 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator - Discovered coordinator DESKTOP-AGC8TKM:9092 (id: 2147483647 rack: <span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>) <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> group test.\n2292 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator - Revoking previously assigned partitions [] <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> group test\n2292 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Partitions [] revoked <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> c2\n2292 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator - (Re-)joining group test\n30321 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.AbstractCoordinator - Successfully joined group test with generation 43\n30321 [main] INFO org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator - Setting newly assigned partitions [topic-0, topic-1] <span class=\"code-keyword\">for</span> group test\n30321 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Partitions [topic-0, topic-1] assigned to c2\n35340 [main] INFO com.mycompany.scratch.NewClass - Polling from c1\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>During the hang in poll, the consumer group tool shows the group as rebalancing</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">$ ./kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group test\nConsumer group `test` is rebalancing.\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>I think we can work around this by switching to manual partition assignment (as the default?), since rebalances don't happen then.

So that should unblock Srishty for now.\r\n\r\nBut let me make a few points:\r\n* The \"standard\" we are using here is just the *Google* standard, it's not some industry-wide thing that everyone strictly follows.  I'm not sure whether we should be trying to follow it strictly, or just using it as a jumping off point for our own standard.\r\n* ~~I'm pretty sure most would agree that `ignoreFinal` *should* be `false` (unlike the google default), because otherwise your constants won't be be allowed to be named `FOO_BAR`, they'd be named `Foo_Bar` or `FooBar`, neither of which stand out as being a constant.  So that's at least one more deviation I strongly believe we should be making.  And I'm sure there are more, the Google \"standard\" seems to be a bit wacky IMHO.~~\r\n   * As @srdo pointed out [below](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2109#issuecomment-302190521), this point is invalid, because constants in Java should be specified with *both* `final` and `static`.\r\n* If your statement about \"documentation\" and \"HBase\" (I'm not familiar with that issue) is about how we're obscuring what we've changed from the Google defaults, I do have sympathy for that view.  But that's because it's also going to be harder to upgrade our version of checkstyle later, since we'll need our changes to be applied to a newer google_checks.xml file. Though I will note that it's quite easy to craft a command to show the changes we've made so far:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n   % diff <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/checkstyle-7.7/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml) <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/storm/master/storm-buildtools/storm_checkstyle.xml)\r\n    1a2,19\r\n    > \r\n    > <!--\r\n    >  Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n    >  contributor license agreements.

I'm not sure if you can just run it on your laptop directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/302275986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/302328129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2072#issuecomment-302328129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2072","id":302328129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjMyODEyOQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T07:48:04Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T07:48:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Left a comment to know intention of changing build process.

Are you saying passing it as a constructor argument is more clear than setting a public property? If yes, I dont agree with you on that. That extra constructor does not add any value. Plus, community is encouraged to use new spout. So unless there is a blocker or critical bug in the old spout i prefer not changing any code there.\r\n\r\nFor storm-kafka-client I plan to raise a PR to get rid of the builder pattern. Builder pattern relies on builder.build() and pass the returned object to the constructor. Unfortunately, that does not work well with flux. Hence setProp method, either on the builder (or may be in future directly on KafkaSpoutConfig) is encouraged. There are so many other properties on kafka consumer api. It does not make sense to expose each one of those as a setXXX java method. Without those setXXX methods it is a much cleaner api for spout and its config object. Intellisense should not be the top priority here. I would prefer a cleaner api.
