Therefore, if the Ranger db_setup.py script was previously run using Python2 in the system, it would not throw an error. \r\nThis is because `subprocess.Popen(command, stdout = subprocess.PIPE)` returns a str in Python2, but returns bytes in Python3.\r\n\r\nSo, if you use a Python3 script to execute db_setup.py, modifying it to `(key, _, value) = line.decode('utf8').partition('=')` is good. However, there are many places where similar subprocess.Popen code exists, and all have encoding issues. \r\nAll Python scripts for Ranger are based on Python2, so upgrading them all would be a better

Only Flink and YCSB took a long time for running dh_strip_nondeterminism (1h+ and 30m respectively) and your PR is significantly effective (it shortened the whole build time to 25m and 4m).\r\n\r\nBased on the observation above, how about overriding dh_strip_nondeterminism only in Flink and YCSB?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1765502029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1765509887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1184#issuecomment-1765509887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1184","id":1765509887,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5pO4r_","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-17T01:26:41Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T01:26:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sekikn Thank you very much for your detailed testing and review.

Or you can file it as another issue and address it separately. Either is fine.\r\n\r\n* (minor nit) There are other component names (hbase and hive) in the copyright and postinst files. Would you fix them?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1769704046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1770162451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1197#issuecomment-1770162451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1197","id":1770162451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5pgokT","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-19T06:43:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T06:43:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sekikn \r\nThank you very much for helping with the review, the modifications have been completed.

After applying the current PR, `pg_ctl initdb` is executed before installing ranger-admin. But postgresql is installed as Ranger's dependency, so there is no executable when the command above is executed. As its result, applying the Ranger manifest fails as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./docker-hadoop.sh -d -dcp -C config_ubuntu-22.04.yaml -F docker-compose-cgroupv2.yml -G -L -k hdfs,hbase,ranger -s ranger -c 1\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nError: Could not find command '/usr/bin/pg_ctl'                                                                                                                                               \r\nError: /Stage[main]/Ranger::Admin/Exec[initdb]/returns: change from 'notrun' to ['0'] failed: Could not find command '/usr/bin/pg_ctl'                                                        \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we have to reorganize the Puppet manifest, not only removing package declarations. The steps are supposed to be:\r\n\r\n1. install python and ranger-admin (and postgres as its dependency)\r\n2. run initdb after ensuring 1 is finished\r\n3. startup postgres ensuring 2 is finished\r\n4. put install.properties ensuring 1 is finished\r\n5. run setup.sh ensuring 3 and 4 are finished\r\n\r\nIn addition, the directory layout of postgres seems to differ between rpm- and deb-based systems.\r\nFor example, pg_ctl doesn't seem to be located in /usr/bin, but /usr/lib/postgresql/$VERSION/bin on Debian/Ubuntu.\r\nAlso, the database directory currently specified in the Puppet manifest (/var/lib/pgsql/data) probably doesn't work on deb-based systems due to the directory permission.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1770544958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1772254274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1200#issuecomment-1772254274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1200","id":1772254274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5ponRC","user":{"login":"iwasakims","id":1856607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTY2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1856607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims","html_url":"https://github.com/iwasakims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T07:51:50Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T07:51:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Why ERROR and WARN messages are not shown at all after the patch is applied?

\r\nThis PR fixed the code for packaging Ranger deb, and it can be successfully installed and started on Ubuntu 22, but the unit test failed.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1201\r\n\r\nCode Logic:\r\n1.PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 22 doesn't need to be initialized, it's automatically initialized after installation.\r\n2.The logic to change the PostgreSQL password was added because PostgreSQL 14, installed on Ubuntu 22, cannot be accessed without a password.\r\n3.The default location for the JDBC driver installed in Ubuntu is /usr/share/java/postgresql-jdbc.jar, so it's necessary to create a symbolic link and keep it consistent with the configuration\r\n\r\nI tested the packaging of Ranger on a machine running Ubuntu 22, and manually installed it, but the same error was still reported.\r\nThis error is very strange, and there's no starting point to resolve it. I spent a lot of time on testing but couldn't solve it.\r\nI compared the deb packaging files one by one with the bin package after Ranger compilation, and there was no missing part. It seems that the error might not be related to Ranger packaging, and might be related to the operating system instead.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm stuck here, I wonder if you could help me out with this

Both BIGTOP-4046 and BIGTOP-4045 are based on BIGTOP-4044, and they both depend on BIGTOP-4044. Therefore, when testing BIGTOP-4046 and BIGTOP-4045, it's necessary to include BIGTOP-4044 in the merge as well.\r\n\r\nRegarding the patch numbering convention you mentioned, I've also noticed it. However, what has been confusing is that this is a shared patch. If we add a patch number, it means that the names of this patch will be different for all components because the patch numbers will vary.\r\n\r\nI have also considered another approach, which involves placing this patch in bigtop-packages/src/templates and then copying this patch to the respective build directory after adding the corresponding compilation options. However, there are two drawbacks to this approach:\r\n\r\nIt would require an additional property to control whether the patch needs to be copied to this project because some projects are not Java projects, and some projects do not yet support parallel compilation. This would mean having two properties to control parallel compilation, adding complexity and potentially reducing usability.\r\nConsidering this, it seems that adding a patch number might be a better choice compared to the second approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1859370915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1859375462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1214#issuecomment-1859375462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1214","id":1859375462,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5u09Fm","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-18T01:08:04Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T01:08:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@iwasakims \r\nI have grouped the parallel compilation PRs as subtasks under the BIGTOP-4044 issue for better progress management.
