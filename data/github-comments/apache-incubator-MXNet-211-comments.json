Also is there any issue with performance with the above workaround?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/313517002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/313517591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6931#issuecomment-313517591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6931","id":313517591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzUxNzU5MQ==","user":{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-06T20:58:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-06T20:58:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@GuilongZh Please try the code below.
