Consider that it will create quite some diff noise and probably merge conflicts for any open PRs.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there's a tool that does these transformations for you: https://lebab.io/. Last time I checked it was a bit overzealous with the arrow functions, resulting in bad code layout. And one of the code transforms choked on our license header. So *if* we do this, it might be worth considering throwing something like `prettier` at the code to format it uniformly (and make sure we make `git blame` completely useless). @janpio Would love to do that, I hear :wink:\r\n\r\nOf course, for `var` to `const` simple search and replace should work too.

Maybe along the lines of https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier\r\n\r\nIf that's not acceptable, I would prefer dropping version pinning and putting emphasis on the latest versions of the modules. The old versions of platforms and other modules are losing importance constantly, because technologies are deprecated and removed all the time.

Only in case they do not review the PR for \"their\" package the DefinitelyTyped maintainers will do an express review (and if the CI passes merge the PR).  \r\nI'm happy to help with the typings but would appreciate it, if there would be more than person involved with the typings - otherwise a missing review could block an otherwise good PR.\r\n\r\n> What are the processes to generate them?

Can we remove them? Currently in question is `create`, but the rest can probably go as well.\r\n\r\nI believe project creations is typically performed with Cordova CLI. I am not sure how many people actually create a project from the platform package.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of the question\r\n## The originating problems background\r\nOnce bundled dependencies were removed, when a platform is added, all of the dependencies are installed into the projects root directory, flattened. Therefore the copy command fails because the `node_modules/cordova-ios/node_modules` directory no longer exists.\r\n\r\n## Removing the bug\r\nYes, the best solution is to remove the copy command but there are still test failures to resolve.\r\n\r\n## The test failures\r\nThe failures are coming from `create.spec.js`, an e2e test file. The test uses the `create` binary to create a project. When creating a project, a path must be provided where the project will be created. In that folder, since the platform is being copied over and not installed via NPM, it needs the `node_modules` of the checked out platform to copy over. If it's not copied, it will fail later due to missing packages.\r\n\r\nIf I attempt to copy the `node_modules` directory into the temp project folder before it is called, create process will fail because it will appear as if the project already exists.\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/erisu/cordova-ios/jobs/433949167#L3190\r\n\r\n## The question\r\nBasically, there were two options that I can think of. If CLI `cordova platform add ios` is the typical pattern, should the ability to create a project from the platform be valid? If not it can be removed.\r\n\r\nIf we want to maintain this option, we can update the binary to pass in a flag within the options argument. The flag could be called `isNotCli: true`, and then update the copy node_modules line to come from the `__dirname` and only called when `isNotCli: true`. The reason for a negated option is so we do not need to update CLI code. \r\n\r\nAlternative flags could be: `isPlatformBin: true`, ... \r\n\r\nI am thinking the binaries can be removed and the tests using the binaries as well can be removed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any confusion let me know and I will try to clear it up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/426887402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/426958486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/39#issuecomment-426958486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/39","id":426958486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjk1ODQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"timbru31","id":838003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODAwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/838003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31","html_url":"https://github.com/timbru31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timbru31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T09:59:12Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T09:59:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That sounds like a plan!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/426958486/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/427229721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/8#issuecomment-427229721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/8","id":427229721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzIyOTcyMQ==","user":{"login":"erisu","id":1029107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjkxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu","html_url":"https://github.com/erisu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erisu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-05T02:43:21Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T02:43:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is this task completed?
