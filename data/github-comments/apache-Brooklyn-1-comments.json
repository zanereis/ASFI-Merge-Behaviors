The linked CNCF site above refers to Brooklyn's repository as `Repository https://github.com/apache/brooklyn-server`.   I'm guessing this change in `./.../brooklyn` will not fix the linked page above,  is that right?  I expect we should also update `brooklyn-server` and our other repositories (`dist`, `docs` etc.)?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/comments/399103696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/comments/399140451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brooklyn/pull/15#issuecomment-399140451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/15","id":399140451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTE0MDQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"ahgittin","id":496540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjU0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/496540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin","html_url":"https://github.com/ahgittin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahgittin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T15:16:50Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T15:16:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@eirinikos TY.  i agree with the objective and this is a good partial implementation.  two main questions:\r\n\r\n(1) do you have an Apache ICLA on file with the ASF so we can merge this?\r\n\r\n(2) is the \"APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\" required for `licensee` to work?  given the existence of google etc it seems pointless.\r\n\r\n\r\n@geomacy your point is correct, this should be done for all the sub-projects too.  however the LICENSE files are auto-generated so rather than do them piecemeal i suggest we:\r\n\r\n(A) agree the approach\r\n(B) apply it to the scripts\r\n(C) rerun the scripts\r\n\r\nregarding (A) @eirinikos @geomacy, i'm not thrilled about moving the current header to 1000 lines down as it means a person reading it won't easily find it and probably won't have any clue that there is anything present in the file other than the main license.  but i can see why the tool requires it to be the first or the only text in the file.  however apache requires us to include much of that other info -- it doesn't _need_ the header but i think a header makes the information much more useful.  which is a bit of a catch-22.\r\n\r\ni wonder whether we could make `LICENSE` be _just_ the Apache License, and move other items into `NOTICE`.  the ASF docs vary as to what should go into `NOTICE` but on the surface of it, given the trend that tools expect `LICENSE` to be a standard license nothing more nothing less, it seems a logical move to make `NOTICE` be the guy who holds all the other stuff.  i will ask on the relevent ML and report back.\r\n\r\nregarding (B) i've been working on that for a related issue as per ML so happy to pick this up once we settle (A).\r\n\r\nin the meantime i think this should be merged once we have ICLA confirmation so that CNCF and other tools get the right idea, and we should check once we've done (C) that they still get the right idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/comments/399140451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/comments/399165630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brooklyn/pull/15#issuecomment-399165630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/15","id":399165630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTE2NTYzMA==","user":{"login":"geomacy","id":14142759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQyNzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14142759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy","html_url":"https://github.com/geomacy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T16:32:17Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T16:32:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds good to me @ahgittin \r\n\r\nYes it was my intention to update the scripts to change the licenses elsewhere, if you are happy to pick this up as part of changes you are making anyway that's grand.\r\n\r\n@eirinikos sorry I should have asked about an ICLA, it would be great if you could file one.

I know the source code is the _official_ release, but I see that as an object of record which should have _clear_ and _reliable_ build instructions but no requirement to make it _easy_ to build.  (And as you know very well it is _not_ easy to build, with rpm and npm and go etc etc, so a couple extra build arguments is relatively small!)\r\n\r\nAlso there is no super easy fix that I'm aware of.  The build _is_ broken from a non-SCM source copy, and this PR fixes that problem.  I'd love it if there's a better way that allows `buildNumber` to get a default value, but that can be another PR that reverts this.  Desire for that shouldn't block this.\r\n\r\nTo answer your final question these variables result in the SHA1 commit ID of each source code project to be encoded in the generated JARs and other artifacts, and served up in the REST API.

request](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Brooklyn/job/brooklyn/view/change-requests/job/PR-52/4/consoleText) so the difference may be down to the workspace contents here, or perhaps the Docker images since the `master` image is cached, but the pull-request image is built fresh each time...?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/comments/842311759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/comments/883545245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brooklyn/pull/54#issuecomment-883545245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brooklyn/issues/54","id":883545245,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtDrA840qdSd","user":{"login":"sachpak","id":72699556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjk5NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72699556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak","html_url":"https://github.com/sachpak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachpak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-20T16:53:34Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T16:54:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks
