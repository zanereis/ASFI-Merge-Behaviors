Given the scope of the current pull request, I recommend considering that change separately.\r\n\r\nIn general, sensitive properties such as passwords do not support reading from environment variables. The reason is that environment variables are also accessible through Expression Language, so they are not necessarily secure. The use case is still supported through Parameter Contexts and Parameter Providers, where the Environment Variable Parameter Provider can be used. This is an additional layer of indirection, but it follows the general convention for other sensitive properties.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2111054120/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2111149151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7745#issuecomment-2111149151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7745","id":2111149151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM591ZRf","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-14T21:11:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T21:11:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the update @ChrisSamo632 all looks good to me at this point.

It was deprecated in 1.x and removed in 2.x for what amounts of lack of maintenance and this new PR does not change that nature.  There is clearly much of this which is simply copy and paste from the previous state.  While there are a lot of comments all of them look actually very easily addressed.  \r\n\r\nThey do however call into question the level of consideration that went into creating the newly offered couchbase components in the first place.  L&N is important to get right and review.  Avoiding duplicative dependencies in the chain is important for maintenance, behavior, and build size.  Bumping from the older clients to the newer clients implies these components were considered for new compability implications with Couchbase server/etc..  By re-introducing these components to the codebase the presumption is that you as the author considered these things.  If not, it is best to avoid re-introducing until such time that can be done because otherwise we're at the previous position again in terms of lack of maintenance.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2118253612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2118310157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8845#issuecomment-2118310157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8845","id":2118310157,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5-QtkN","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T20:06:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T20:06:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will
