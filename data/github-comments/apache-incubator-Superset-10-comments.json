for the slow reply on this. long term I think we're considering moving the entire front end to React. That likely means that visualizations should easily wrapped as React components, something along these lines:\n\n`const propTypes = {`\n`data: PropTypes.array,`\n`width: PropTypes.number,`\n`height: PropTypes.number,`\n`margin: PropTypes.shape({`\n`left: PropTypes.number,`\n`top: PropTypes.number,`\n`right: PropTypes.number,`\n`bottom: PropTypes.number`\n`})\n`};`\n\n`const Chart = React.createClass({`\n\n  `getDefaultProps() {`\n    `return defaultProps;`\n  `},`\n\n  `componentDidMount() {`\n    `const container = this.refs.chart;`\n    `chart.create(container, this.props);`\n  `},`\n\n  `componentDidUpdate() {`\n    `chart.update(this.props);`\n  `},`\n\n  `componentWillUnmount() {`\n    `chart.destroy();`\n `},`\n\n`render() {`\n`const { width, height } = this.props;`\n`return (`\n`<div`\n`ref=\"chart\"`\n`className=\"vis-chart\"`\n`style={{`\n`width: '${width}px',`\n`height: '${height}px'`\n`}}`\n`/>`\n`);`\n  `}`\n`});`\n\nEach chart should then clearly implement a `create()`, `update()`, and `destroy()` method, and `props` defines any customizable attribute or accessor of the chart. With this setup the `update()` has to handle updates for any prop. Right now the vis's are very inconsistent for the `refresh()` method, most simply call `render()` again, and are written in a way that depends on the `Slice` object (i.e., they are not modular). We also should eventually also update the Python side to make it even easier to dropin new vis's as plugins.\n\nI also like the approach `d3.chart` takes because it is easily extensible with the hooks they provide into initialization, updating, transitions, etc.:

like cross-filtering just as much as the next guy, but it was a conscious not to bring a large dataset back to the browser. For this kind of interactivity to be possible you need an indexed dataset with all dimensions/metrics in the browser. As users bring in more metrics and dimensions that dataset can get quite out of hand, forcing complex abstractions like having multiple datasets on the the client side that can be partly linked on shared dimensions. But all that becomes quite very tricky extremely quickly, so we decided to steer away from it.\n\nWith our simple approach, it's easy to cache very small snippets of data for each widget and puts most of the workload on the server side when things aren't cached. \n\nWe could support an individual crossfilter widget that could be multi-chart pretty easily, but the backend of the dashboard will most likely stay as it is, with the different widgets being loosely coupled (through the dashboard controller) and individually making calls to the backend.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/212071411/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":2,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/212073602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/375#issuecomment-212073602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/375","id":212073602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjA3MzYwMg==","user":{"login":"philippfrenzel","id":2319890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel","html_url":"https://github.com/philippfrenzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philippfrenzel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T19:13:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T19:13:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, \n\nI totally understand your concern. What I normally do for building a performant datastructure is to union all metrics tables and then link the dimensions in a simple 1 connection star model. So I love your sense of not blowing up the analysis on the other side some analyic functions would rock! \n\nSo maybe a compromise would be to enable the cross-filtering for one data view and then check which slices are linked to the same datasource and then apply the filter to the same? And maybe a sign within the chart showing that a filter got applied to the view..?\n\nQlik Sense does it like this...\n\nBest

For example, if the user wants the dashboard to refresh every 10 seconds, but the query actually takes 30s, without the callback, there can be too many http requests pending in the browser. Maybe the user should choose a 1-minute interval, but maybe the user just doesn't know they are making the server load heavy. So I think a callback is natural for an async operation like this.
