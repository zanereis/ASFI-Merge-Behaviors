For instance consider the following sshd log file:\n\n```\n070823 21:00:32       1 Connect     root@localhost on test1\n070823 21:00:48       1 Query       show tables\n070823 21:00:56       1 Query       select * from category\n070917 16:29:01      21 Query       select * from location\n070917 16:29:12      21 Query       select * from location where id = 1 LIMIT 1\n```\n\nYou can't really split this by space or tab, and dissecting it with various string slicing functions would lead to some very complex and ugly queries.   But with the following regex:\n\n```\n^(\\d{6}\\s\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2})\\s+(\\d+)\\s(\\w+)\\s+(.+)$\n```\n\nYou can extract all the fields and query them.  \nWith respect to the HTTPD log parser, the log parser accepts a format string in the configuration (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-3423) and with that you can parse any kind of HTTPD log. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/253401211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/253580693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/601#issuecomment-253580693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/601","id":253580693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzU4MDY5Mw==","user":{"login":"laurentgo","id":677448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzQ0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/677448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo","html_url":"https://github.com/laurentgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T17:26:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T17:26:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing: same as #613\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/253580693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/253595326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/602#issuecomment-253595326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/602","id":253595326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzU5NTMyNg==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T18:19:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T18:19:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's discuss this offline.

I just have the following observations -\n1) The build on Windows was a problem for me. I found CppUnit here (http://dev-www.libreoffice.org/src/cppunit-1.13.2.tar.gz). There is a Windows solutions file that will build on VS 2013\nHowever FindCppUnit needs to be updated to find CppUnit on Windows as there is no standard location the build will install to.\n\n2) The cmake script now requires maven which in turn requires the JDK!. Is it possible to generate the product version from the root pom? This would be useful as the version is automatically changed at the time of the release. \nEither way you should update the windows build instructions on where to get CppUnit. Also, include instructions that the build requires JDK and Maven as this was not previously required.\n\n3) I hacked findCppUnit and that found the libs and header files, but the unit tests failed to compile. I did not spend too much time on this though.\n\n4) On MacOs, I upgraded my ZK libs to 3.4.7 (I built from source) and the build goes thru fine. There are some new warnings which should be removed -\n`/Users/pchandra/work/drill/contrib/native/client/src/clientlib/drillClientImpl.hpp:364:4: warning: field 'm_bIsDirectConnection' will be initialized after field 'm_bIsConnected'\n      [-Wreorder]\n                        m_bIsDirectConnection(false),\n                        ^\n/Users/pchandra/work/drill/contrib/native/client/src/clientlib/drillClientImpl.hpp:583:34: warning: field 'm_bIsDirectConnection' will be initialized after field\n      'm_maxConcurrentConnections' [-Wreorder]\n        PooledDrillClientImpl(): m_bIsDirectConnection(false), m_maxConcurrentConnections(DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS), m_lastConnection(-1), m_pError(NULL), m_quer...\n                                 ^\n/Users/pchandra/work/drill/contrib/native/client/src/clientlib/drillClientImpl.hpp:583:64: warning: field 'm_maxConcurrentConnections' will be initialized after field\n      'm_lastConnection' [-Wreorder]\n        PooledDrillClientImpl(): m_bIsDirectConnection(false), m_maxConcurrentConnections(DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS), m_lastConnection(-1), m_pError(NULL), m_quer...\n                                                               ^\n/Users/pchandra/work/drill/contrib/native/client/src/clientlib/drillClientImpl.hpp:583:150: warning: field 'm_pError' will be initialized after field 'm_queriesExecuted'\n      [-Wreorder]\n        PooledDrillClientImpl(): m_bIsDirectConnection(false), m_maxConcurrentConnections(DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS), m_lastConnection(-1), m_pError(NULL), m_quer...\n`\n\nOther than that, things are really good. Even though it made reviewing the code much harder, thank you for refactoring and cleaning up the code.\n\nBTW, I also built and tested the build on linux, windows and macos. I also ran a bunch of queries and cancels thru valgrind, and everything was nice and clean.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/254969644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/254971065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/622#issuecomment-254971065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/622","id":254971065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDk3MTA2NQ==","user":{"login":"laurentgo","id":677448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzQ0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/677448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo","html_url":"https://github.com/laurentgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laurentgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-19T23:36:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T23:36:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers I missed your comments, but I don't mind doing a follow up.

Regarding CppUnit, it seems the LibreOffice folks are using the version hosted on FDo (https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/cppunit/). It seems the source provides instructions on how to build on windows at https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/cppunit/tree/INSTALL-WIN32.txt?id=cppunit-1.13.2\n\nDo you mind posting changes to FindCppUnit so I can add them to the patch? (unless I find a way to build on windows meanwhile)\n\n2) To get the version from the pom, I would need at least a xml parser, like libxml2, so I could write a script like that one:\n\n```\nxmllint --shell pom.xml << EOT\n> setns maven=http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\n> cd //maven:project/maven:version/text()\n> write version\n> bye\n> EOT\n```\n\nbut I guess having xmllint2 installed on a windows box is a similar burden.\n\nI'm open to suggestions (maybe @superbstreak have some ideas?), otherwise I'll add a valid Java/Maven environment as a prerequisite\n\n4) It looks like llvm and xcode have a different set of warnings, I'll check those and fix them.\n\nMore generally, do you want to keep this pull request as one change (and merge it as one commit), or do you prefer I open separate pull requests for each DRILL jira I addressed?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/254977619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/254984991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/624#issuecomment-254984991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/624","id":254984991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDk4NDk5MQ==","user":{"login":"Ben-Zvi","id":5465159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjUxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5465159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben-Zvi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben-Zvi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T01:20:00Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T01:20:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM  (also tested this change -- worked as expected).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/254984991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/254987496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/602#issuecomment-254987496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/602","id":254987496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDk4NzQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T01:41:12Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T01:41:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just put the FindCppUnit hack in my branch here: https://github.com/parthchandra/drill/tree/DRILL-4420\nI hit another issue (bit of a show stopper) with windows.
