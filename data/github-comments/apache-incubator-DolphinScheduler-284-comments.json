Remove the dependency of jUnit 4 and migrate all the UTs with IDE `inspections` in this PR.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > However, I think the second method is a bit risky.\r\n> > > WDYT? @caishunfeng @kezhenxu94 @SbloodyS @ruanwenjun\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > I prefer the second way.\r\n> \r\n> I just tried migrating all the UTs and got blocked.\r\n> \r\n> Specifically speaking, there are two risks:\r\n> \r\n> 1. We need to switch all the UTs to use jUnit 5 and `Spotless` will automatically reformat them. I've tried it, there would be 333 files modified.\r\n\r\nThis is totally OK to me, \"migrations\" are always huge changes...\r\n\r\n> 2. We used `powermock` quite a lot in the project and `powermock` does not support `jUnit 5` as stated in [[Improvement][UT] Upgrade junit to 5.+ #10976 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10976#issuecomment-1207427898). It is hardly possible to refactor all the code using `powermock` in one PR.\r\n> \r\n> The real issue blocking me is the second one. May I ask whether there is a good way, or some kind of workaround for the second point? @ruanwenjun @kezhenxu94\r\n\r\nI hope we could finally get rid of powermock one day, did you find any alternative to Powermock in JUnit5 platform? Or it's just impossible?

@kezhenxu94 @caishunfeng \r\nFinally I managed to remove the dependency of `jUnit 4` since it is wired, ugly and confusing to have two versions of `jUnit` in `pom.xml`.\r\n\r\nI have the same worries that ` if we still keep the Junit4, we need to constantly remind contributors to use Junit5`.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though I have removed the dependency of `jUnit 4`, contributors still could write `jUnit 4` fashion UTs as long as we use `junit-vintage-engine`. It is quite difficult to migrate all legacy tests in this PR. I will keep working on this but I prefer doing it iteratively. \r\n\r\nAbout `Powermock`, It seems we could use high version (greater than 3.4.0) `Mockito` to mock static methods and I've already added the dependency in this PR. I need more time to find out whether the latest `Mockito` could fully replace `Powermock` since we use `Powermock` quite a lot previously. Also, I find someone use `bytebuddy` to do some trick but I'm not sure whether this trick could apply here: https://git.stklcode.de/stklcode/juraclient/commit/c9444bbc971cd36f80824c3e7ec9baf8ecfbd676. \r\nBut I believe we could get rid of `Powermock` as long as we set our minds to : ) \r\nhttps://wttech.blog/blog/2020/mocking-static-methods-made-possible-in-mockito-3.4.0/\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the legacy tests, we could migrate some of them easily with `Intellij`, but still, there are some complicated ones we need to do it manually. \r\n\r\nAbove all, there are two action items after this PR, if you agree:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Remove dependency of `Powermock`. https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11405.\r\n- [ ] Migrate legacy code and replace `junit-vintage-engine` with `junit-jupiter-engine`.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1211054006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1211433261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10878#issuecomment-1211433261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10878","id":1211433261,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5INQEt","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T00:24:02Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T00:24:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity for 30 days.

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nIn the officially released version 3.0, there is a problem when setting the timing parameters. The maximum value of the hour, day and month selection has reached 59, which is not distinguished from the second and minute selection.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56808442/184103074-8e0d565f-57f2-4d46-a490-4ff09cc8f22c.png)\r\nThis will cause parsing of the crontab expression to

happen\n\nI hope to fix this bug like in 2.0.5\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nAfter the workflow is online, set a timed task, and you can see it in the drop-down box corresponding to the specific hours on

When worker failover, in the function of `killYarnJob`, the logic is send a view log request to worker and then parse it. However, worker is just the client to submit yarn job, the worker failover will not auto-kill submitted yarn jobs, so in the situation that worker is failover and how can it response the log
