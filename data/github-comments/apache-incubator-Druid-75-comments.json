the importance of the issues @dclim raised are, from most important to least,\n- 3 (supervisor persisting) is critical\n- 6 (avoiding killing \"safe\" tasks on startup) is important to make people feel like it's safe to restart overlords whenever they want (which is currently the case, and we want to keep it that way)\n- 2 (unnecessary replicas being killed and FAILED) is important, as the current behavior will be confusing for users like @himanshug pointed out\n- 1 (eliminating ingestion pauses) is going to be critical for users that have a real real-time requirement, and nice to have for other users\n- 5 (early stopping) would be nice for getting schema updates out faster. Kafka tasks support restoreTasksOnRestart so I think this is not really needed for rolling updates (the tasks can restore after a MM restart)\n- 4 (keeping replicas in sync) is nice but least important\n\nOf those I think 3, 6, 2 are important to do before releasing the feature at all.\n\nI think we can live without 1 for the first release but should do it in a follow-up.\n\nI think 5, 4 are nice improvements but less critical than the others.\n\n@himanshug - does this sound reasonable to you?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/199462784/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/199496137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2675#issuecomment-199496137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2675","id":199496137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTQ5NjEzNw==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-21T21:33:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T21:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@binlijin

It might be interesting if we allowed the user to specify a target for how long they want the task to run and then run an initial task to ingest a small number of events to get a feel of the events/sec and then use this to tune our offset ranges. Also like you said, if we had graceful shutdown we could guarantee tasks live as long as we want them to. Is that along the lines of what you were thinking? (have the user set the lifetime of the task in time vs number of

\n\nre: changing SelectorFilter and JavascriptFilter to implement DimensionPredicateFilter\n\nThere are some performance considerations if that change were made:\n- getBitmapIndex() for DimensionPredicateFilter requires a scan through the column's dictionary values to determine which values matched the predicate. For SelectorFilter without an extraction function, the current getBitmapIndex() is much simpler/faster since it can just call selector.getBitmapIndex(dimension, value).\n- For JavascriptFilter, the current implementation allows getBitmapIndex() to reuse the Context object across the scan of the dictionary. Using the JavascriptPredicate with DimensionPredicateFilter's getBitmapIndex() function would result in a new Context object being created on every apply() call. There's a note regarding this performance consideration at:\n  https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/io/druid/segment/filter/JavaScriptFilter.java#L92\n\nI think, if that change is desirable, it's better handled in a separate
