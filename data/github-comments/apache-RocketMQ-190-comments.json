[TIMEOUT_CLEAN_QUEUE]broker busy, start flow control for a while, period in queue: 200ms, size of queue: 9 这个错误是服务端处理达到瓶颈限流了。调整 sendMessageThreadPoolNums 没有意义，在实际存储消息的地方，因为是单文件，数据写入之前会加锁处理。如果只是偶尔有这个报错，可以适当调整 waitTimeMillsInSendQueue 这个参数(默认 200ms，比如可以调整为 500ms)，可以让请求在队列中多保留一会，来减少这个报错。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2545071080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2545132067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/9051#issuecomment-2545132067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/9051","id":2545132067,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86Xs6Ij","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-16T10:01:10Z","updated_at":"2024-12-16T10:01:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
