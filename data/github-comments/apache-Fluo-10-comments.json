The solution is to group workers into fixed sized groups and have each group scan a disjoint set of tablets.  \r\n\r\nFor example if there are 23 workers, a minimum group size of 7, and 100 tablets, then would create the following groups :\r\n\r\n * Group 1 with 8 workers and 34 tablets\r\n * Group 2 with 8 workers and 33 tablets\r\n * Group 3 with 7 workers and 33 tablets\r\n\r\nEach worker in group 1 would have a unique id within the group ranging from 0 to 7.  A worker with id 5 in the group would scan all 34 of the groups tablets looking for notifications where `hash(notification) % 8 == 5`.  \r\n\r\nThis solution allows the cost of scanning for notifications to stay fixed as the number of workers grows.  \r\nThe reason to have groups of workers is that it evens out notification processing in the case where notifications are not evenly distributed among tablets.\r\n\r\nThe current notification finding implementation in Fluo has a single group.  So notification processing is very evenly spread among workers without having worry about collisions.  However, the cost of every worker scanning every tablet does not scale well as the number of workers grows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/291199063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/291213455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/500#issuecomment-291213455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/500","id":291213455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTIxMzQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-03T17:26:44Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T17:26:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"How would tablets be assigned to groups?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/291213455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/291231758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/500#issuecomment-291231758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/500","id":291231758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTIzMTc1OA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-03T18:30:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T18:30:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> How would tablets be assigned to groups?\r\n\r\nGood question, I have spent a good bit of time thinking about this.  This is easy to do, IF all of the workers can agree on what the current set of tablets for a table is.  However, the workers can possibly read different splits at different times.\r\n\r\nI was trying to figure out a fancy distributed way of all workers agreeing on the same set of split points for a table (for a time period), but could not think of anything.  So I think putting the splits in zookeeper is a good option.  I am currently thinking of taking a subset of table split points where the total size is less than 128K or 256K and putting that in zookeeper. Thinking of reading the splits and removing all odd splits while the total size is greater than 256K before storing in ZK.  The worker with the lowest ID could manage the splits stored in ZK.  All other workers can observe the splits node.  \r\n\r\nOnce the workers all agree on a set of split point, its smooth sailing.  Using the info about workers in zookeeper, can decide how many groups there are.  Then can shuffle the splits in a deterministic way and round robin assign to them to groups.  This should lead to all workers making the same decisions about which splits are in a group.  The shuffle+round robin will result in very even and random assignment of tablets to groups.  I was thinking it would be nice to avoid assigning contiguous tablets to a group.\r\n\r\nI have used the term tablets and splits.  In reality all of the worker just need to agree on some set of row ranges for the table that don't overlap and cover the table.  It does not need to be tablet split points, that's just convenient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/291231758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/292171198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/500#issuecomment-292171198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/500","id":292171198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjE3MTE5OA==","user":{"login":"mjwall","id":2342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall","html_url":"https://github.com/mjwall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjwall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T13:17:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T13:17:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"How does recovery happen if any given process is killed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/292171198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/292301706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/500#issuecomment-292301706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/500","id":292301706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjMwMTcwNg==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T20:11:37Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T20:11:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> How does recovery happen if any given process is killed?\r\n\r\nAll of the information used to partition workers, tablets, and notification comes from zookeeper.
