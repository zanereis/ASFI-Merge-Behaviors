@adelapena do we need to add testing for `maxwritetime` here?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to add some basic coverage in the new test class, yes. Note that there are more detailed tests for `maxwritetime` on [`TimestampTest`](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/26dd119679605bf61ad3caa24a70509e5be5aac9/test/unit/org/apache/cassandra/cql3/validation/entities/TimestampTest.java#L115-L181). I have modified the proposed `WritetimeOrTTLTest` to include some checks on `maxwritetime`.

- thanks for taking a look.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, I'm not sure how we define or pin the plexus dependency that is the source of the CVE here\r\n\r\nThe plexus-utils2 dependency is a transitive dependency included in the last released version of Maven Ant Tasks, which we pull in as a JAR here: https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/889ca60edc8afd85b4a594442883c1b5efdf3c6b/build.xml#L472\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to address CVE-2017-1000487, I considered authoring a forked Maven Ant Tasks and bumping the plexus-utils2 dependency to bypass the vulnerable version. I figured that it was worse to maintain a fork of a long-retired project, even with a very simple fork. It's unfortunate that Maven Artifact Resolver Ant Tasks [doesn't support an alternative](https://lists.apache.org/thread/o0llzvf55zgo2nqn6yq1m4lhv3t9vdk7) to the writepom task - in my opinion, that would be ideal. And because Maven Ant Tasks is required so early in our build, we can't use exclusion rules to re-write the plexus-utils2 dependency since Maven Ant Tasks is what resolves those exclusions in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to simplify to two POMs, by removing `apache-cassandra-build-deps.pom`. I'm not clear on why that's necessary when Maven already supports different classpath scopes for dependencies (compile, provided, test, etc), and we could ideally include all the build dependencies in `apache-cassandra.pom` with the compile scope.\r\n\r\nI agree that this adds some pain to dependency management for contributors. I tried to simplify this as much as possible with my changes in f80da9b, by centralizing all dependency versions and scopes in the parent POM, and making the child POMs reference those.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other thoughts on this approach before I share this discussion with the dev list?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1184807504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1184843242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1725#issuecomment-1184843242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1725","id":1184843242,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5Gn0Xq","user":{"login":"michaelsembwever","id":559444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTQ0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/559444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelsembwever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T19:58:49Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T19:58:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The plexus-utils2 dependency is a transitive dependency included in the last released version of Maven Ant Tasks\r\n\r\nYes, plexus is inside the jar file.\r\n\r\n> I considered authoring a forked Maven Ant Tasks \r\n\r\nWe define where we download the jar file from, so we can download a patched jar file from any other location (though we want the source open and verifiable).\r\n\r\n> Do you have any other thoughts on this approach before I share this discussion with the dev list?\r\n\r\nCan you explain how one takes advantage of this CVE here?

Our test dependencies need not be made public.\r\nYou cannot find our test classes anywhere in a maven repo, so why publish the test dependencies list? \r\n\r\nThe dependency list is use for two things: actual dependencies (build and test) , and publishing maven poms for those maven jars we publish.

While it's valuable in practice to separate the application's classpath from the test classpath, it's important for us because the application's classpath (`lib/`) is bundled into our convenience (binary) artefacts.

“merge down, copy up” and the “tofu scale: firm above, soft below”\r\n\r\n@dcapwell , we're (or I was) largely talking past each other :) \r\n\r\nThe precedence in the project is what you describe as already doing: \"forward merges (as this is our protocol), but then overrides the commit with the branch specific patch to avoid issues\".\r\n\r\nI also think it's normal, if not already a precedence, to start with just one branch's patch – avoiding the cost of patching multiple branches until an initial review has completed.\r\n\r\nMy [initial response](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1725#issuecomment-1191907509), which was a bit orthogonal to your point of focusing just with one branch patch initially (apologies), was only that the initial patch+review doesn't have to be trunk: that other contributors and reviewers may prefer starting with the patch on a harder branch… that's all :)

I will try to figure it out tomorrow but at least we have a workaround and I wanted to show you what I came up with so far. Currently that method is also only used by the in-jvm test framework. \r\nThe Converter was broken when we introduced null post CASSANDRA-15234, I will add to the new tests for the rest of the properties and converters in a separate commit tomorrow.

For example, the cluster is in the mixed mode and the old node (as the coordinator) receives the query with WRITETIME and it further queries replicas running both old and new versions.\r\n\r\nIn that case, if the column is not a collection the old coordinator would run the query as usual. Nothing has changed for regular columns so the new nodes would return the same. If the column is a collection the old coordinator would reject the query before that wasn't supported until now.\r\n\r\nAs for queries running on the new node, they would work even if there are not upgraded nodes, because everything happens on the coordinator's CQL layer. \r\n\r\nThe problematic case would be aggregation queries such as `MAX(WRITETIME)` or `MAX(TTL)` running on a new node while there are not-upgraded nodes. Those queries won't work properly because the selector is serialized and sent to the not-upgraded nodes. So I think we should add a note advising against using these functions on not-frozen collections/UDTs when upgrading to 4.2, similar to the one that we added for `MAXWRITETIME`.
