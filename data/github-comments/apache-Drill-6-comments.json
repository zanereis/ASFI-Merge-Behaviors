This patch -as the numbers above check out- is more of a clean-up than an extension. My plan was to discuss possible changes to API going forward once this clean-up patch made its way to master. Here is the rationale: I spent quite a while trying to understand the current design, event flow in the API in an attempt to find a way for subscribing to store events. Especially being notified when an ephemeral node dies just like what Zookeeper watches offer. I got confused multiple times with E/PStore and E/PStoreProvider distinction at interface level as it seems redundant. That's how the idea of this clean-up patch rolled out. \n\nAs for naming, I am open for non-abbreviated alternates. I would invite developers relying on this interface to read the documentation first. To this end, I will go ahead and extend documentation with possible warning areas. \n\nPlease let me know if you want me to address specific issues with this patch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/172126518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/172369155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/325#issuecomment-172369155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/325","id":172369155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjM2OTE1NQ==","user":{"login":"jacques-n","id":183350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n","html_url":"https://github.com/jacques-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-17T19:27:30Z","updated_at":"2016-01-17T19:27:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You want to do a hangout to discuss the concept of EStores and watches and the relationship with the ClusterCoordinator interface.

quick note, I still am receiving failures on a small set of unit tests because of metric registration conflicts so I'll be fixing those. (Happens only in tests where a single JVM contains multiple drillbits since the registry is currently static.) Also, I'm concerned that some portion of allocation is not getting tracked since the tests that Vicky just posted on DRILL-4266 don't show a zero peak allocation for the RPC data layer (which doesn't make any sense unless all the queries were single fragmented).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/172623959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/172747355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/325#issuecomment-172747355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/325","id":172747355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mjc0NzM1NQ==","user":{"login":"jacques-n","id":183350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n","html_url":"https://github.com/jacques-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T05:44:18Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T05:44:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's do a separate hangout.

The code remained available for five days for review and received two plus ones and no negative feedback. It is modeled after the HBase plugin and works the same. It is unfortunate that there aren't integrated tests (due to the fact that there wasn't an easy way to provide integrated tests such as mini hbase cluster) but it was and is regularly manually tested. Due to the light testing, we are communicating it as experimental to users.\n\nSuggesting it didn't go through review when you have that large a group of developers involved is weird. Assuming that the user api isn't in dispute (which no one here disputed most likely because Kudu looks exactly like an Oracle table), providing experimental plugins increases the breadth of Drill's appeal and thus broadens and strengthens the community. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/185738887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/185825063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/380#issuecomment-185825063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/380","id":185825063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTgyNTA2Mw==","user":{"login":"jaltekruse","id":365366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTM2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse","html_url":"https://github.com/jaltekruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaltekruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T17:26:34Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T17:26:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you also add result verification?
