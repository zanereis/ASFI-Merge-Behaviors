We started the project by javaagent, doesn't mean it must be agent working, especially we have other languages. As far as I known, @liuhaoyang will provide .NET CLR receiver soon, maybe in 6.1.0\r\n\r\nBut we can say one thing, we could run in multiple scenarios\r\n1. Language agent.\r\n1. Service Mesh.\r\n1. Envoy.\r\n1. Zipkin\r\n\r\nIn these three modes, we have certain receivers and `application.yml`, right? Could we consider to deliver different startup scripts to run in different modes?\r\n- `startup-in-language-agent-mode.sh`, Trace, JVM, CLR, register on.\r\n- `startup-in-mesh-mode.sh`, istio, mesh, envoy, register on.\r\n- `startup-in-proxy-mode.sh`, only envoy on.\r\n- `startup-in-zipkin.sh`,  zipkin and trace on.\r\n\r\nAnd, with\r\n- `startup-all.sh` with all receivers on(only turn zipkin-off, because it is not production ready, this is a clear principle). This is for quick-start and docker entry.\r\n\r\nIf we have this, we could have a clear document why we open these receiver, and which scenario requests us to open.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/470923616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/470924371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1360#issuecomment-470924371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1360","id":470924371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDkyNDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T13:15:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T13:15:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kezhenxu94

We create span at Controller edge, then, no matter which web container is used inside, the span will work as expected.  \r\n\r\nLike in the codes\r\n```\r\npublic class MyServer extends AbstractVerticle {\r\n \r\n    @Override\r\n    public void start() {\r\n \r\n        Router router = Router.router(vertx);\r\n \r\n        router.route().handler(this::queryHandler);\r\n        vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router::accept)\r\n                .listen(8080);\r\n        System.out.println(\"MyServer startup\");\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    private void queryHandler(RoutingContext routingContext) {\r\n        routingContext.response()\r\n                .putHeader(\"content_type\", \"application/json\")\r\n                .end(\"hello world\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpan should be created when `#requestHandler` called, there should not be a shared thread at this point, because it can't in Java thread model, the `requestHandler` will hold the thread until it is done or start a child thread(that is context capture/continue designed for)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/471366370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/471366837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2342#issuecomment-471366837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2342","id":471366837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTM2NjgzNw==","user":{"login":"BFergerson","id":3278877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzg4Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3278877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson","html_url":"https://github.com/BFergerson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-10T23:51:15Z","updated_at":"2019-03-10T23:51:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wu-sheng, thanks for the quick response.

I'm pretty sure you're absolutely right. Unfortunately, I think that's the only way to use Vert.x. Everything that runs in the verticle is run on the event loop and in my situation, there is only a single event loop. That's what I'm seeing locally as I debug the creation of the spans. The thread is always `vert.x-eventloop-thread-0`.\r\n\r\nI should have included some Vert.x code to begin with to open this discussion. I've included some below and described the steps the code takes and the steps I take to trace it.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Sender extends AbstractVerticle {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();\r\n        vertx.deployVerticle(new Sender());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void start() {\r\n        Router router = Router.router(vertx);\r\n        router.route().handler(BodyHandler.create());\r\n        router.get(\"/products/:productID\").handler(this::handleGetProduct);\r\n        vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router).listen(8080);\r\n\r\n        //vertx.setPeriodic(1000, v -> callGetProduct());\r\n        callGetProduct();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void callGetProduct() {\r\n        HttpClient httpClient = vertx.createHttpClient();\r\n        httpClient.getNow(8080, \"localhost\", \"/products/test\",\r\n                new Handler<HttpClientResponse>() {\r\n\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void handle(HttpClientResponse httpClientResponse) {\r\n                        System.out.println(\"Got response\");\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void handleGetProduct(RoutingContext routingContext) {\r\n        HttpServerResponse response = routingContext.response();\r\n        vertx.setTimer(4000, it -> {\r\n            response.setStatusCode(200).end(\"Done\");\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried to keep it as simple as possible and I think I'm creating the right spans at the right places.\r\n - I have an `HttpClient` which calls a `GET` request on `/products/test`. This opens a `ExitSpan`.\r\n - This request is received by `handleGetProduct`. This opens a `EntrySpan`.\r\n - The response is delayed by 4 seconds and then responds with \"Done\". This closes the `EntrySpan`.\r\n - The response is received by `handle`. This closes the `ExitSpan`.\r\n\r\nThe locations I'm doing the opening and closing of spans seems correct to me as well.\r\n - The `HttpClient` sends the `GET` request by calling `HttpClientRequestImpl.end()`. I take the `ContextCarrier` and inject it into the header and open the `ExitSpan`. I also assign the `ContextSnapshot` to the request (via `EnhancedInstance`) for closing later.\r\n - The `GET` request is receieved and sent to the target method via `HttpServerRequestImpl.doEnd()`. I remove the headers to rebuild the `ContextCarrier` and open a `EntrySpan`. I also assign the `ContextSnapshot` to the response (via `EnhancedInstance`) for closing later.\r\n - 4 seconds pass\r\n - I pull the `ContextSnapshot` from the response (via `EnhancedInstance`) and close the `EntrySpan` once `HttpServerResponseImpl.end()` is called as this signifies the response has been written.\r\n - I pull the `ContextSnapshot` from the request (via `EnhancedInstance`) and close the `ExitSpan` once `HttpClientRequestImpl.doHandleResponse()` is called as this signifies a request has been replied to.\r\n\r\nAgain, this all works when I just go through this flow once. The single call in the code to `callGetProduct();` fulfills this scenario. It's once `//vertx.setPeriodic(1000, v -> callGetProduct());` is uncommented that it starts acting up. As you can see, `setPeriodic` makes the call to `callGetProduct` every second. This means that I won't have the previous trace closed by the time the next one starts.\r\n\r\nGiven that Vert.x is running everything on a shared thread, and the goal is to not create spans on a shared thread, what's my move here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/471383541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/471424791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2341#issuecomment-471424791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2341","id":471424791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTQyNDc5MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T06:56:27Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T06:56:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The HttpClient sends the GET request by calling HttpClientRequestImpl.end().

The `ContextSnapshot` is saved to the `SkyWalkingDynamicField` for the request. The `ExitSpan` is closed on `afterMethod`.\r\n - The `GET` call is received and a `EntrySpan` is opened with the `ContextCarrier` extracted from the request's headers during `beforeMethod`. The `ContextSnapshot` is set on the `SkyWalkingDynamicField` of the response object.  The `EntrySpan` is closed on the `afterMethod`.\r\n - 4 seconds pass\r\n - `HttpServerResponseImplEndInterceptor.beforeMethod` is triggered and creates a `LocalSpan` and calls `ContextManager.continued` with the `ContextSnapshot` saved to the response object. The `LocalSpan` is closed on the `afterMethod`.\r\n - `HttpClientRequestImplDoHandleResponseInterceptor.beforeMethod` is triggered and creates a `LocalSpan` and calls `ContextManager.continued` with the `ContextSnapshot` saved to the request object. The `LocalSpan` is closed on the `afterMethod`.\r\n\r\nI don't exactly have a question here so I hope you see what I'm doing wrong.
