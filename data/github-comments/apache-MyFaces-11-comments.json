fix is only to queue the action event for some scenarios. \r\n\r\nWhen 4606 was introduced, it allowed all ajax calls (on the form's submit button) to invoke the action event. For example: \r\n\r\n```\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h:inputText />\r\n      <h:commandButton id=\"confirm3\" value=\"listner3\" action=\"#{ajaxEventBean.confirm()}\" >\r\n          <f:ajax event=\"mouseover\"/>\r\n      </h:commandButton>\r\n    </div>\r\n```\r\nThe mouseover event would trigger a form submission.  I don't think that's intended. It didn't happen prior to 4606. \r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think the current 4606 behavior is correct here, so maybe we should revert it.  However, the question I have is which ajax events should trigger an action event?  I'm having a hard time find what the spec says here.  As for the decode button behavior, it says the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n> Obtain the Map from the \"requestParameterMap\" property of the ExternalContext. If the value in the Map for the value of the \"clientId\" property of the component is null, create a String by concatenating the value of the \"clientId\" property of the component with the String \".x\" (without the quotes). Create another String in the same manner, but concatenate \".y\" (without the quotes). If null is the value in the Map for both Strings, return from decode(). If the value in the Map for the value of the \"clientId\" property of the component is not null, get the value of the \"type\" attribute, and convert it to lower case. If the result is equal to the String \"reset\" (without the quotes), return from decode(). Otherwise, create a javax.faces.event.ActionEvent around the component, and pass it to the queueEvent() method of the component, which must be an instance of UICommand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wording here could be significantly improved in my opinion, but it doesn't mention ajax here. \r\n\r\nCurrent options: \r\n1) Revert 4606\r\n2) Only allow certain ajax events to trigger action events. \r\n3) Other\r\n\r\nAlthough..... re-looking at the fix, the `isSubmitted` method does handle ajax via the `HtmlRendererUtils.isPartialOrBehaviorSubmit(facesContext, clientId);` check in the return.  \r\n\r\n Perhaps some other refactoring could be done here...?  Let me push up a new commit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/2316639835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/2316917914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/736#issuecomment-2316917914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/736","id":2316917914,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs6KGVya","user":{"login":"tandraschko","id":2485545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2485545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko","html_url":"https://github.com/tandraschko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-29T07:38:06Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T07:38:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Of course should this trigger an AJAX request:\r\n```\r\n      <h:commandButton id=\"confirm3\" value=\"listner3\" action=\"#{ajaxEventBean.confirm()}\" >\r\n          <f:ajax event=\"mouseover\"/>\r\n      </h:commandButton>\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it should not trigger a non-AJAX request","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/2316917914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/2317895344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/736#issuecomment-2317895344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/736","id":2317895344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs6KKEaw","user":{"login":"volosied","id":5934310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied","html_url":"https://github.com/volosied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-29T14:34:06Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T14:34:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, an ajax request still occurs, but it's basically a no-op (unless it has a listener attached).

was not the problem if the TCK test, the problem was that the render ID was outside of any form, but given there is exactly one form in the page it was safe enough to use that one for the viewstate handling!\r\nIt still would fail with a two form setup, but then you could use a form passthrough parameter to reference the form you want to use (a feature Mojarra probably does not have in its js implementation, but perfectly html5 compliant)\r\n\r\nI personally think using a form attribute as reference to a form somewhere in the page which is not a parent or a child of the updated element, is more elegant than trying to do auto detection of a form in a page, which introduces \"magic\" but now we have both and with both mechanisms we can cover the single form and multiple form usecases without any crude hacks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/2429933454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/2429935299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/769#issuecomment-2429935299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/769","id":2429935299,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs6Q1d7D","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-22T18:11:14Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T18:11:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
