loukey-lj, excited to hear a fantastic idea. \r\nMay I know if you have tried part of this idea? For example, updating parquet file actually is not bounded to hudi framework. We can have a unit test by directly rewrite a file only depending on parquet api. As far as I know, parquet file requests schema to be unique among all row groups.

Couple of issues I noted\r\n\r\n- When trying to open any blog page the page crashes with the message `editUrl is not a function` \r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-13 at 12 29 20 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179254/189993336-292dd89b-c44f-4819-8982-be5c47249d30.png)\r\n\r\n- When listing all articles with a single tag, previously it was crowded and overlapped. Now all articles are displayed 1 after another like below which is better than before. But the image being too big and needing to scroll a lot with this view, can we make it display in grid style with two or three blogs per row (similar to blog landing page)? That way it is easy to scroll. \r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-13 at 12 40 04 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179254/189994269-bc44837c-fc2d-4406-8716-611392874cb5.png)\r\n\r\n- The other thing I noticed is we need to disable reading time in the Blogs landing page. Since there are both external docs  and native docs. External docs are redirected pages and reading time for them is displayed as 1 minute which doesn't make sense. We only want the reading time displayed when we open a blog. In the blogs landing page we don't need them.\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-09-13 at 12 42 06 PM copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179254/189995269-4ae9058c-bb45-4c30-aa07-75a1bbe5b4d9.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1245882796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1245884295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6654#issuecomment-1245884295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6654","id":1245884295,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5KQq-H","user":{"login":"bhasudha","id":2179254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzkyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha","html_url":"https://github.com/bhasudha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-13T19:49:47Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T19:49:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Once these issues are fixed we are closer to landing this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1245884295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1245978612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5358#issuecomment-1245978612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5358","id":1245978612,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5KRB_0","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-13T21:37:08Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T21:37:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing it due to no activity for long time. \r\nfeel free to raise a new issue for any assistance.

For multiple spark jobs, we cannot avoid `union`. Good thing is that clustering does not do rdd.union, instead it runs context.union which is slightly better. Benchmark revealed that writing to parquet column as a whole incurs high overhead. Another thing which hogs up memory is bytes-avro conversion. More details in HUDI-2949. \r\nThe fix entailed making changes in [parquet-mr](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/commit/06bb358bcf8a0855c54f20122a57a88d9fde16c1). That fix has been merged but we have not yet upgraded parquet version in Hudi. Created HUDI-4840 to track the upgrade.

This feature will make many things really fast and simple.\r\n\r\nHope my example is useful for understanding the feature provided by our RFC :) @yihua @prasannarajaperumal @alexeykudinkin ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1246305177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1246335065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5242#issuecomment-1246335065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5242","id":1246335065,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5KSZBZ","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-14T07:04:31Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T07:04:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am unable to reproduce this issue with version 0.12.0. I ran the whole quickstart (which has multiple commits) with the same fixed timeline server port. Looking at the code, I don't see a reason why the same port cannot be used.
