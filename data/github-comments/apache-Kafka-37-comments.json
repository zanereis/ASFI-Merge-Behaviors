Just a high level comment. Should we step back and take a holistic approach to changing all ZK accesses in the controller to use the raw ZK client api? This is because (1) We also identified an issue (KAFKA-3083) related to the controller soft failure, which potentially requires direct access to raw ZK client api to fix; (2) We probably don't want to make the controller code more complicated by having it to deal with both sync and async mode.\n\nThis may take a bit more effort. However, it will move the controller to a state that we ultimately want. We can't immediately remove the dependency on ZKClient due to the scale consumer. However, we can at least change all the ZK usage in the broker to use the raw ZK client api and leave the ZK usage in the scala consumer untouched.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/172724684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/172750649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/786#issuecomment-172750649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/786","id":172750649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mjc1MDY0OQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T06:08:12Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T06:08:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the catch @dajac , just wondering where in your code did you call `sizeInBytes` (currently it is only triggered in `RecordAccumulator`)? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/172750649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/172753584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/786#issuecomment-172753584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/786","id":172753584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mjc1MzU4NA==","user":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T06:23:30Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T06:23:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guozhangwang I'm was playing with Records/MemoryRecords in the context of KAFKA-2066.

However, it will be useful to improve the performance in other places as well. For example, when the controller fails over, the first thing that it does is to read all existing topic/partitions from ZK. Using the async api there will speed up controller failover. So, perhaps moving completely to the async api will be better since it gives better performance and makes the code more uniform?

That makes sense for compatibility if the V1 option would be tried when any other version is seen. I suspect when we add a V3 or V4 we would also maintain writing the older fields for V1 & V2 in `ZkUtils.registerBrokerInZk`. It could make sense to have the parsing logic in `Broker.createBroker` (or anything reading Json from Zookeeper) try all known versions in descending order from the version received from ZK. but perhaps that logic is too loose. \n\nA generic function to capture whatever rule is defined such as `parseVersionedJson` could take functions for each versions and return the successful result or fail. Rough pseudo code for examples sake:\n\n``` scala\ndef parseVersionedJson[T](json: String, versionedParsers: Map[Int, String => T]): T = {\n  Json.parseFull(json) match {\n    case Some(m) =>\n      val fields = m.asInstanceOf[Map[String, Any]]\n      val version = fields(\"version\").asInstanceOf[Int]\n      if(versionedParsers.contains(version)) {\n        versionedParsers(version)(json)\n
