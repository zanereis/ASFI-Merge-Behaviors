Would it be easy to write or modify a unit test to verify the behaviour? It's subtle and it seems overkill to have to run the system tests to detect it (the system tests are useful for other reasons, of course).\n\nOn a more general note, I think it's better to avoid methods like AbstractCoordinator.metadata() where we return a LinkedHashMap to indicate that ordering is important.

Based on my local observations, there are two issues going on that are causing the failures we observed on jenkins. \n\nThe first one is that if we always provide the Client/Server sections in the jaas file, then the client will spot it when we pass the jaas login file to the Kafka server and will try to authenticate with the ZooKeeper ensemble. The client will fail if the server isn't configured to do it because it'll keep waiting for the SaslAuthenticated event which will never come. I fixed this by making those sections of the jaas loging file conditional on the field zk_sasl.\n\nThe second issue is the one I mentioned to you offline about increasing the zookeeper connect timeout. Before I give evidence that increasing the timeout is necessary, let me give some background. In the client state machine of zookeeper, if the client isn't trying to authenticate, then it will receive a SyncConnected event meaning that client can start submitting requests. When trying to authenticate, the client needs to receive additionally a SaslAuthenticated event. Now let's check these log messages from a Kafka server while running the test case proposed here: \n\n```\n[2015-12-03 11:11:31,914] INFO starting (kafka.server.KafkaServer)\n[2015-12-03 11:11:32,084] DEBUG Initializing task scheduler.

Prepare to shutdown (kafka.server.KafkaServer)\n```\n\nThe client starts connecting around second 32 and it receives the SyncConnected event around second 34, barely making the timeout of 2s. If this client were not trying to authenticate, then it'd be fine. The SaslAuthenticated event, however, only comes after the timeout expires, which causes the Kafka server to shutdown.\n\nIt is possible that increasing the timeout is only necessary for my slow machine.

Really appreciate your detailed description of your use case. So it seems your pipeline looks like this:\n\n[data source] --> [input Kafka topics] ---> Service A / B / etc.. ---> [output Kafka topics, ...]\n\nwhere:\n\n1) Data source could contain \"entities\" (or in a another word, updates streams); and hence its ETL input Kafka topics need to be log compacted;\n2) Service A / B / .. could be stateful processing and would prefer its input topic to be partitioned according to its inner state's key so each parallel processor can get all the records per specific key;\n3) Output of each of the service A / B /.. needs to be sent to a single Kafka topicfor duplicate handling in exactly-once guarantees.\n\nSo it seems the issue we want to solve here is that for input Kafka topics, where we want to enable log compaction on the full message key for these topics while at the same time partition them with partial key for different services. What I was suggesting is that we can modify the pipeline as:\n\n[data source] --> [log-compacted Kafka topics] ---> repartition service ---> [re-partitioned Kafka topics] --> Service A / B / etc.. \n\nwhere the \"log-compacted Kafka\" contains data ETL'ed from the data source and is log compacted with full message key, and a repartition service consumes from these topics and send them to another tier of topics by transforming the record <key, value> to <partial-key, value> with partial key as the partitioning key (with different re-partitioned Kafka topics their partial-key may be different, e.g. <database>/<collection> for one topic and <database>/<collection>/<table> for another topic, etc). So we separate log compaction with partitioning into separate tiers of topics. Would this work for your scenario?\n\nBTW as you may know we are are now developing a high-level DSL called KStream on top of the Processor Topology API layer, where users can just use APIs like \n\n`KStream.from(\"source-topic\").map(<key, value> -> extractPartialKey()).aggregateByKey(aggFunc)`\n\nwhich will be translated to the underlying processor topology with re-partitioning automatically added to the topology, which will abstract users a lot more from the underlying Kafka integration such as partitioning, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/162668080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/162672006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/579#issuecomment-162672006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/579","id":162672006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjY3MjAwNg==","user":{"login":"ymatsuda","id":169548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/169548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda","html_url":"https://github.com/ymatsuda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T21:39:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T21:39:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"lgtm\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/162672006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/162678474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/309#issuecomment-162678474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/309","id":162678474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjY3ODQ3NA==","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T21:58:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T21:58:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang, that is a pretty accurate description of my use case. However, I still don't think that using separate tiers of topics provides the same functionality or guarantees. Not only are the extra tiers increasing the latency for completing each request (remember, my system is processing requests and delivering responses in near real time), but they may actually cause reordering of some requests of _related_ entities (e.g., all entities within a group or collection). Manually specifying the partitions minimizes the # of topics and services involved (and thus latency), and it helps me control total ordering of related requests.\n\n> BTW as you may know we are are now developing a high-level DSL called KStream on top of the Processor Topology API layer, where users can just use APIs like\n> \n> ```\n> KStream.from(\"source-topic\").map(<key, value> -> extractPartialKey()).aggregateByKey(aggFunc)\n> ```\n> \n> which will be translated to the underlying processor topology with re-partitioning automatically added to the topology, which will abstract users a lot more from the underlying Kafka integration such as partitioning, etc.\n\nI am aware of the KStream DSL, and understood KStreams to be a way of implementing a topology with processing logic that could be represented as the provided simple functions (e.g., map, flatMap, branch, filter, windowing, etc.). Since my processor logic is complex (carefully using one or more state stores) to ensure exactly-once processing, that appeared to be well beyond the capability of KStreams and so I have not investigated it in much details.\n\nAlso, are you suggesting that a single KStream \"program\" might produce multiple topologies, or perhaps a single topology that uses intermediate streams not defined by the builder's `from(...)` and `sendTo(...)` methods? If so, is this documented anywhere?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/162678474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/162701043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/579#issuecomment-162701043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/579","id":162701043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjcwMTA0Mw==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-07T23:11:15Z","updated_at":"2015-12-07T23:11:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\n\nCan you create a JIRA to remove the ZK dependency after KIP-4 is done?

Today we only contain state-store operation latency metrics, with the following format:\n\n1) groupName = \"streaming-\" + scopeName + \"-metrics\", where scopeName defines the store type, e.g. \"in-memory-state\", \"in-memory-lru-state\", \"rocksdb-state\".\n\n2) no additional tags from the framework, i.e. still have one tag as clientId, while we have APIs for users to add more tags if they want while developing their own state implementations.\n\n3) we define metric name based on the operation name and the \"entity\" name (i.e. store name for this set of metrics) , in two levels:\n\nA global metric with metricName e.g. \"all-put\", \"all-get\", \"all-delete\";\nA per-store metric with metricName e.g. \"store1-put\", \"store2-put\", .. etc where the global metrics' sensor is the parent of the per-store metrics' sensor.\n\nWith this, we still only define metrics per-thread, not per-task within the thread, but distinguish different state-store instances.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163056539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163059252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/643#issuecomment-163059252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/643","id":163059252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzA1OTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"ymatsuda","id":169548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTU0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/169548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda","html_url":"https://github.com/ymatsuda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymatsuda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T23:48:19Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T23:48:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"lgtm\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/163059252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
