We can create other sampling operators following the same strategy.\nIt'll be easy to implement the policy gradient algorithm using this operator. In fact, policy gradient can be viewed as a gradient w.r.t a special kind of loss `R\\log p(\\hat{a}|s)` where `s` is the state and `\\hat{a}` is the generated sample.  We can set `R` to be different values to implement different kinds of PG algorithms. For example, we can set `R = reward - baseline`, which leads to a special version of REINFORCE.\n\n``` python\ndef safe_eval(expr):\n    if type(expr) is str:\n        return ast.literal_eval(expr)\n

@feiyulv , I also observed the low efficiency of RNN, which includes low speed and unstable GPU util. I thought that it is because a new graph is always created for a new batch. But after checking the code, it seems that `DataParallelExecutorManager` will not create a new graph for a seen length key and I am getting more confused.\n\n@pluskid Any idea about this issue? I tried several times to sell mxnet to others, however, for the current performance on RNN, it might be less convincing to encourage NLP people to use it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253147678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253147788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3506#issuecomment-253147788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3506","id":253147788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzE0Nzc4OA==","user":{"login":"ijkguo","id":13162287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTYyMjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13162287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo","html_url":"https://github.com/ijkguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T08:12:38Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T08:24:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It must came as a surprise to change the naming of symbol_inception-bn.py. If it break your model, please stick to the previous symbol.py. If not, this change will be justified by the following account.\n\nThe previous version of symbol.py does not correspond to pretrained model, either. To accurately reflect the previous model the symbol would be:\n\n``` python\n# stage 2\nconv_2_reduce = mx.symbol.Convolution(data=pool1, num_filter=64, kernel=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1), pad=(0, 0), name='conv_2_reduce')\nbn_2_1 = mx.symbol.BatchNorm(data=conv_2_reduce, name='bn_2_1')\nrelu_2_1 = mx.symbol.Activation(data=bn_2_1, act_type='relu', name='relu_2_1')\nconv2 = ConvFactory(data=relu_2_1, num_filter=192, kernel=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), pad=(1, 1), name='2')\npool2 = mx.symbol.Pooling(data=conv2, kernel=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), name='pool2', pool_type='max')\n```\n\nThis seems strange so a change from '2_reduce' and '2_1' to '2_red' is proposed. We also change 'conv_conv1' and 'bn_conv1' to 'conv_1' and 'bn_1' since it is consistent throughout entire network.\n\nActually it is not likely to reproduce the previous model `inception-bn_old.tar.gz` since pooling behavior is changed.\n\nThe parameters of eps, bn_mom and fix_gamma is a practical training choice. Current setting works and should be further adjusted to suit your need.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253147788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253149173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3509#issuecomment-253149173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3509","id":253149173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzE0OTE3Mw==","user":{"login":"starimpact","id":2155428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTU0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2155428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact","html_url":"https://github.com/starimpact","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T08:19:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T08:19:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"v0.9.0rc1

version?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253382664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253387748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3193#issuecomment-253387748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3193","id":253387748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzM4Nzc0OA==","user":{"login":"feiyulv","id":18651286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxMjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv","html_url":"https://github.com/feiyulv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feiyulv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T01:39:26Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T01:39:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@magic282 If you use the bucket, the gpu util will be unstable at the beginning, but after all the buckets are constructed, gpu util will be stable. In my case, I do't use bucket key, and create a new symbol  for each batch. You can try the new nnvm, it will be faster. Bucket is a little ugly, it forces more padding, and has to calculate bucket keys and bucket size for different dataset.\n@pluskid The result I provided yesterday was wrong, nnvm is really faster than the original mxnet for variable length lstm(1400 vs 1150), but the gpu util is still unstable. I check the code in model.py, the forward and backward caller of executor is asynchronous, so theoretically the time of symbol construction/destruction can be overlapped by training. The drop of  gpu util may be caused by the construction/destruction time is too long to be hidden. Is that possible to support dynamical graph construction as theano?

Great set of points. Doing this would greatly improve user experience for MXNet users.\nI agree with most of your suggestions on organizing the content and adding new content. Me along with some more people at Amazon are working on coming up with a proposal on improving docs page navigation and organization of content.\n\nMost of our current plan overlaps with your suggestions. I will be adding a correspondence here with more details (combining ideas we have and people's suggestion in this thread) by end of day Friday.\n\nAt high level I would like to take this forward in multiple steps as below:\n- [ ] Present the proposal for re-organization of mxnet docs.\n- [ ] Make required changes for high level re-organization of contents.\n- [ ] Improve Installation set up guide\n- [ ] Improve Tutorial section\n- [ ] Improve \"How to\" section. Add contents on applications, training etc. pulling from mxnet/examples.\n- [ ] Re-organize \"API/Python\" section.\n- [ ] Re-organize \"API/Scala\", \"API/Julia\", \"API/R\" sections.\n- [ ] Re-organize \"FAQ\" section\n- [ ] Create \"Developers Guide\" section. It might be good idea to have \"Community\" with sub-options \"Committer\", \"Issues\", \"mailing list\" ?\n- [ ] Explore usage of doctest.\n- [ ] Explore integration test set up on examples. Explore running IPython notebooks.\n\nWe can create separate issues for each of above tasks and track them?\n\nDo let me know your thoughts and suggestions team.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253477751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253480462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3514#issuecomment-253480462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3514","id":253480462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzQ4MDQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"aaronzs","id":1827365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjczNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1827365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T10:51:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T10:51:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

I understand your idea,  MXNet is truly good at asynchronous computation.\n\nHowever, my case is to develop the [\"Asynchronous Method for Deep Reinforcement Learning\"(A3C) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783). \n\nIt is **multi-processor computing on a single machine with centralized neural network parameters**, which usually involves more than 16 parallel actor-learners. \n\nMulti-threading is not feasible, partly because the RL environements are not thread-safe. \n\nDistributed KVStore is also not optimal because it will introduce too much overhead caused by network communication.\n\nNumpy has an API that allows as to create an array from a existing memory buffer, which enables multiprocessing.\n\nI would be willing to develop such functionality for KVStore that supports efficient single-machine, multi-process communication based on shared memory, given that it's not supported yet.\n\nThanks!\n\nPeter\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253505189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253523342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1392#issuecomment-253523342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1392","id":253523342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzUyMzM0Mg==","user":{"login":"marcociccone","id":1114692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1114692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone","html_url":"https://github.com/marcociccone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcociccone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T14:07:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T14:07:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@starimpact Could you please share your Cudnnv2 version? a fork or a gist file would be really appreciated by the community :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/253523342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
