Your project `zipkin-tests` does not contain `src/main/java/module-info.java` and no JPMS, so you may freely remove the workaround `useModuleInfo=false` since of Surefire `3.0.0-M6`.\r\nTo explain why the default value is set to `true` is the reason that we have to respect user's settings of the project. If the project (a folder which has POM) contains `src/main/java/module-info.java` then we have to respect it and employ module paths as much as possible instead of flat classpaths.

In the UI it looks like this then:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/193792/96350575-c3342980-10b6-11eb-9c7a-d6c4f290fd93.png)\r\n\r\nOfcourse, if you'ld rather have the async operation as a separate trace you can disable this behaviour and set a key as annotation in both traces for correlation purposes if still needed.\r\n\r\nAll this just to illustrate that async spans can be tracked in the different ways like is described in this issue, but that it is up to the instrumentor to decide how.
