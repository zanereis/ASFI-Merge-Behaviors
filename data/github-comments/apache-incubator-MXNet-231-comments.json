points made by piiswrong@ and leopd@. \r\n\r\nBased on my experience of using fork() over many years, I would say that calling fork() from a Multi-Threaded process is typically NOT recommended. If you do, you will need to understand the details in how it works to make correct use of it. A few caveats on the use of fork() are:\r\n\r\n1. The behavior of fork() can vary across operating systems. For example, Solaris has fork-one and fork-all model, whereas Linux has fork-one model. The fork-one model duplicates only the calling thread whereas the fork-all model duplicates all the calling threads.\r\n\r\n2. The fork-one model can leave mutexes in bad state in the called thread. See excellent description of the problems in the classic book on Linux Programming Interface [2].\r\n\r\n3. A good summary of the problem is here: [3]\r\n\r\n4. More problems are described here: [4]. For example, you need to ensure that Close-on-exec flag is set for file-descriptors [depends on whether the programming language does it for you, C does not], otherwise two processes will have reference to the same file and close() from one process will NOT actually close the file since the file is also referenced from the other process. \r\n\r\n5. Long discussion on why fork without exec is dangerous in large programs [5]. I always used exec() after a fork() and set the Close-on-exec() for file-descriptions when I have called fork() from a MT process.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] fork-one and fork-all model: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-6867/gen-1/index.html\r\n[2] The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook\r\nBy Michael Kerrisk: https://books.google.com/books?id=Ps2SH727eCIC&pg=PA686&lpg=PA686&dq=fork+but+no+exec+mutex&source=bl&ots=kMBgx2BVwb&sig=PI74pt3fvO8gHKLLUaIUrr_shy8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTu8qn75_WAhVJ7GMKHb46BQIQ6AEIOjAH#v=onepage&q=fork%20but%20no%20exec%20mutex&f=false\r\n[3] https://thorstenball.com/blog/2014/10/13/why-threads-cant-fork/\r\n[4] http://www.linuxprogrammingblog.com/threads-and-fork-think-twice-before-using-them\r\n[5] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12302539\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/328894574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/328896613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3946#issuecomment-328896613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3946","id":328896613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODg5NjYxMw==","user":{"login":"bhavinthaker","id":6851302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTEzMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6851302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker","html_url":"https://github.com/bhavinthaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhavinthaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T15:52:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T15:52:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"phoenixbai> As in caffe case, we have to copy the whole net as many times as the thread number.

m.bind(data_shapes=[DataDesc(\"data\", (bs, 100))],\r\n           label_shapes=[DataDesc(\"label\", (bs,))], force_rebind=True)\r\n    m.init_params()\r\n    if param_name:\r\n        m.load_params(param_name)\r\n    m.init_optimizer(optimizer='adam', optimizer_params=[('learning_rate', 1e-3) ])\r\n...\r\n# in demo\r\n    print(\" loading model \")\r\n    mod = buildModel()\r\n    initModel(mod, bs, \"testmultigpu.params\")\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/329031263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/329031706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7852#issuecomment-329031706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7852","id":329031706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTAzMTcwNg==","user":{"login":"arank","id":3494997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTQ5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3494997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank","html_url":"https://github.com/arank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arank/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T01:37:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T01:37:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Stack

Large indices is definitely a feature we want to support in the long-term. We might want to open a separate issue and discuss this. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, we do plan to add sparse support for Embedding op, where the weight can be in [row_sparse](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/api/python/ndarray/sparse.html) format, and the gradient for the weight should be generated in row_sparse format, too. I am currently working on code refactoring and documentations so this sparse operator is not implemented yet. \r\n\r\nRegarding large indices up to 64 bits, this requires the first task @piiswrong brought up regarding int types in the C API, and the `Kernel::Launch` API in the backend uses 32-bit int instead of 64-bit, which is problematic for many operators which operate on ndarrays of large shape. So the scope is bigger than just the embedding op and definitely, it takes some more time to resolve. \r\n\r\nAre you working on any industrial scale dataset? Two ways to circumvent the 64-bit hashed-index problem in my mind:\r\n1.  rehashing the indices into around 23 or 24 bit to reduce the dimensionality, which doesn't hurt much as claimed by [some paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0902.2206.pdf), and doesn't cause the operator to break in MXNet. \r\n2.  preprocessing the dataset to find out the number of unique features and map them to continuous indices instead.\r\n@formath what's your thought on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/329230030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/329243575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7852#issuecomment-329243575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7852","id":329243575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTI0MzU3NQ==","user":{"login":"FrancisTse8","id":15918099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE4MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15918099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8","html_url":"https://github.com/FrancisTse8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrancisTse8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T17:42:49Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T17:47:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Found out from Sébastien Villemot <sebastien@debian.org> that I have correctly installed LAPACK (shared library, doc and development libraries) and also ATLAS (shared library). Issue is that I gave a wildcard (liblapack*) to apt-get, so it also tried to install virtual packages (like liblapack3gf), which no longer exists but only appears in a Breaks relationship.\r\n\r\nSo, I continued with the MXNet installation by doing:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get -y install git cmake build-essential g++-4.8 c++-4.8 liblapack* libblas* libopencv*\r\ngit clone https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet.git --recursive\r\ncd mxnet\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I got the same error as when I was using Stretch version of Raspbian:\r\n```bash\r\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcblas\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\nMakefile:327: recipe for target 'lib/libmxnet.so' failed\r\nmake: *** [lib/libmxnet.so] Error 1\r\n```\r\nI was going to try loading the cblas library again but this time I got message that libcblas* or libcblas could not be found:\r\n```bash\r\npi@raspberrypi:~/mxnet $ sudo apt-get install libcblas*\r\nReading package lists...
