There is no problem with GC switching, but high-level JDK （after JDK1.8）is not supported because of modularity and class loader.\r\n> 我进行了验证测试，GC替换没有问题，但是由于模块化和类加载器等原因，高版本JDK不支持。\r\n\r\nAccording to the migration guide:\r\n\r\n1. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/migrate/toc.htm#JSMIG-GUID-A78CC891-701D-4549-AA4E-B8DD90228B4B\r\n2. https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/migrate/index.html#JSMIG-GUID-A78CC891-701D-4549-AA4E-B8DD90228B4B\r\n\r\nStarting from JDK 9\r\n> Class and resource files previously stored in lib/rt.jar, lib/tools.jar, lib/dt.jar and various other internal JAR files are stored in a more efficient format in implementation-specific files in the lib directory.\r\n\r\n>The javac compiler and java launcher will exit if the java.ext.dirs system property is set, or if the lib/ext directory exists. To additionally check the platform-specific systemwide directory, specify the -XX:+CheckEndorsedAndExtDirs command-line option. This causes the same exit behavior to occur if the directory exists and isn’t empty. The extension class loader is retained in JDK 9 and is specified as the platform class loader (see getPlatformClassLoader.)\r\n\r\nSo starting from jdk9, it's necessary to remove this line for JAVA_OPT:\r\n`JAVA_OPT=\"${JAVA_OPT} -Djava.ext.dirs=${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/ext:${BASE_DIR}/lib\"`\r\nand rocketmq does not need the extension mechanism.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it's necessary to check if rocketmq break the rules of this new specification (JEP220).\r\n\r\n[See JEP 220: Modular Run-Time Images.
