I tried a new approach which is NOT to merge, but rather replace the TrieMap/AtomicIntegers each time the distributed data is updated (for activationByInvoker and activationByNamespaceId). \r\n\r\nI added a test in LoadBalancerDataTests (\"quickly execute many activations\") that demonstrates - note that the accuracy of counts fluctuates with DistributedData Changed events e.g.:\r\n\r\n- TrieMaps are updated locally, with additional updates send to shared data\r\n- until shared data update is received, TrieMap is accurate for local data, but not for cluster data\r\n- once a shared data update is received, the TrieMap is rebuilt with data that is accurate for the cluster, but may overwrite some local state (which will arrive with the next cluster update)\r\n\r\nTherefore test needs to wait (using Eventually) to receive counts for all the activations. \r\n\r\nSome rough testing numbers:\r\nRunning same test on previous (async) code takes 4.5s for 100k activations, and on this code takes ~1.2s for 100k activations; Meanwhile LocalLoadBalancerData takes ~1s in both cases (as expected). \r\n\r\nLet me know if you think this test is appropriate?   \r\n
