I'm not quite sure whether I understand which problem we are trying to solve here. \r\n\r\nI think by deserializing the `MasterTriggerRestoreHook.Factories` with the user code class loader in `ExecutionGraphBuilder.java:253`, we support user code hooks. Given that the `Factory` is a user defined class, then it should get the user code class loader set as its `ClassLoader`. Thus, it should also be able to load a user defined `MasterTriggerRestoreHook` class. And the latter can only be a user defined class if the factory is user defined.\r\n\r\nBut I might be overlooking something here. Maybe you can give me some more details about the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302395596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302397101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3908#issuecomment-302397101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3908","id":302397101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjM5NzEwMQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T13:03:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T13:03:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After recovery it will report `0`.

the issue is with code that uses the thread's context classloader (TCCL), that may execute in `Factory.create` or later in the hook methods.  For example, the Pravega connector uses grpc, which uses the TCCL during initialization (see [ManagedChannelProvider](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/v1.3.0/core/src/main/java/io/grpc/ManagedChannelProvider.java#L132)).\r\n\r\nLooking at other areas in Flink where usercode is called, I see that the TCCL is consistently set.

agree with @EronWright that it would be nice to offer all user code the a similar environment. This will become especially important if a `MasterTriggerRestoreHook` which is contained in the system class loader tries to load user code classes dynamically.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering whether to follow the approach of the `InputFormatVertex` and `ExecutionJobVertex` to set the TCCL explicitly when calling the hooks. This could happen in `MasterHooks#triggerMasterHooks` for example. The advantage would be that we don't have to reset the TCCL for each hook. On the other hand, it harbours danger that we will forget to set the TCCL when calling the hooks from somewhere else in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302560231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/302560721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3933#issuecomment-302560721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3933","id":302560721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjU2MDcyMQ==","user":{"login":"EronWright","id":1775518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright","html_url":"https://github.com/EronWright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T22:38:36Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T22:40:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Originally I pursued the path suggested by @tillrohrmann of setting the TCCL at the sites where the hook is invoked, but found that the classloader wasn't readily available.
