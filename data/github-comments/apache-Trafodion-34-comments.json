It is found that the use of ByteArrayList class is expensive due to JNI to java transitions for every entry. In almost all cases the size of the byte array is known in advance and hence it would perform best if it is used as array of byte arrays. I have made changes already to avoid the use of ByteArrayList in Trafodion code base in all cases. However, I have retained the ByteArrayList JNI interface to ensure that the build is not broken when this change is merged to other feature branches.  After a short time if there are no objections, I will eliminate the ByteArrayList JNI interfaces entirely.\n\nSo, please if you can plan to use ByteArrayList in near future, you should defer your changes till this is done and consider using array of byte arrays instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/216316318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/216316965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/459#issuecomment-216316965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/459","id":216316965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjMxNjk2NQ==","user":{"login":"prashanth-vasudev","id":13125150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI1MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13125150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev","html_url":"https://github.com/prashanth-vasudev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanth-vasudev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T18:18:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T18:18:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks
