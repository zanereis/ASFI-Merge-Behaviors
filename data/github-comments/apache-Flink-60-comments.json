This way the user can still group/join/sort efficiently on the non-null fields, while preserving null safety for the other fields.\n\nI pushed another commit for this to my temporary branch for review, if this makes sense: https://github.com/jkovacs/flink/compare/feature/FLINK-2576...jkovacs:feature/FLINK-2576-projection-types\n\nAs you can see I was really hoping to make the projection joins work properly :-) but if you feel that the effort isn't worth it or I'm missing something else entirely, we can for sure simply scrap that and throw an `InvalidProgramException` when the user tries to do a project outer join instead of defining his own join udf. Opinions on that are welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/141569673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/141629775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1098#issuecomment-141629775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1098","id":141629775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTYyOTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"HuangWHWHW","id":13193847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTkzODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13193847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW","html_url":"https://github.com/HuangWHWHW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HuangWHWHW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-19T06:10:40Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T06:10:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, could anyone tell me why the last CI failed?\nThanks:)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/141629775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/141629844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1098#issuecomment-141629844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1098","id":141629844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTYyOTg0NA==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-19T06:13:26Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T06:13:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There is a checkstyle error:\n\n```\n[INFO] There is 1 error reported by Checkstyle 6.2 with /tools/maven/checkstyle.xml ruleset.\n[ERROR] src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/datastream/DataStream.java[992] (regexp) RegexpSinglelineJava: Line has leading space characters;
