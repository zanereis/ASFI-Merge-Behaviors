Also, there may be \"single use\" shaded dependencies in non-scala projects, which could still be shaded on the fly in the respective project directly (netty in flink-runtime would be such a case).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300711565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300733280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3856#issuecomment-300733280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3856","id":300733280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDczMzI4MA==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T09:20:30Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T09:20:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha Yes, that might work although I prefer this fix compared to having to mess with the maven versions on deploy servers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300733280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/300736881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3495#issuecomment-300736881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3495","id":300736881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDczNjg4MQ==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-11T09:33:59Z","updated_at":"2017-05-11T09:33:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I do like you code, only thing missing I had in mind yesterday was an idea of defaultGroup, which is an easy way to group options with not overlapping prefixes e.g. right now in documentation (in doc files) of jobmanager we have options like jobmanager.* and blob.*. \r\n\r\nI modified a little bit your solution to enable the defaultGroup.

thanks for working on this!\r\n\r\nOne thing that I've found useful when exporting Flink's statsd metrics to Prometheus is to make several of the metric fields tags: like `job_name`, `task_name`,

Why do we need to use an ExecutorService for the metadata fetching? It seems like there's no concurrency going on for the fetching, and we always block for the result, so it seems like it isn't necessary.\r\n2. I find the code paths of the deprecated constructors of 08 / 09/ 010 slightly hard to follow. It could be better if the deprecated constructors delegate to `this` constructors instead of directly to base constructors.\r\n\r\n@zjureel what do you think? Other than those, I didn't find any other major issue. I'll try to rebase this over the weekend and cleanup the PR for merging (also addressing the above comments). Of course, if you'd like to work on addressing them, let me know and I'll wait for your update!

@hongyuhong, thanks for the update. \r\n\r\nPlease do not squash update commits into the PR. Otherwise it is not possible to review individual changes. If you squash commits, I have to check the whole PR again because I cannot see what was changed since my last review.\r\n\r\nIt would be also good if you could leave a short message when you update a PR.

As discussed in [https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3766](url), there are two ways to control timeout of fetching kafka meta\r\n\r\n1. Depend on the timeout mechanism of kafka. When fetching partition meta from kafka, some timeout configurations should be setted.\r\n2. Using `Future` to get the partiton meta of kafka, and user can set the timeout with configuration.\r\n\r\nIn the new api, meta of kafka may be feched before data is sended, and some exceptions such as network or disk problem may still block data send even that user set the request timeout of kafka. So in the PR, I use Future to control the timeout of fetching kafka meta.\r\n\r\nThe problem may not be so complicated, and we can use the timeout mechanism of kafka directly. What do you think of it? Thanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/301433024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
