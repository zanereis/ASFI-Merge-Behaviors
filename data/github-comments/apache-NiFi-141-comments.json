We would still want to support the current Authorization header approach for direct API access.\r\n\r\nIf we have a good reason for not doing that, and we still want to pursue some type of allow list, could it be done with some kind of patterns? Not sure if all the front-end stuff comes from some base path that we could just allow anything that starts with the base path, or maybe use extensions and say that we allow any .html, .css, .js, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/726796835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/726836856","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4659#issuecomment-726836856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4659","id":726836856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjgzNjg1Ng==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T15:44:24Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T15:44:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tend to agree.

So please forgive my ignorance . But what did you mean by the \"REST API Bundle processors\"?? [#4153 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4153#issuecomment-603790123)\r\n\r\nSee processors in https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-elasticsearch-bundle/nifi-elasticsearch-restapi-processors, which use https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-elasticsearch-bundle/nifi-elasticsearch-client-service\r\n\r\nThink these may need updating too, although a quick look suggests that `_type` is already optional, so maybe all that's needed is to confirm that and ensure there are tests covering the scenario for each processor\r\n\r\nI raised NIFI-8001 to add the ability to specify dynamic properties for query string parameters on the REST API ES processors (as this is something I believe to be missing but useful)\r\n\r\nNIFI-8002 also to provide a scroll/pit/search_after processor using the REST API ES approach (although users could create this in a flow already with a combination of existing processors, but would need some relatively complex loop logic); and NIFI-8003 to create an _update_by_query (like the existing _delete_by_query)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/727070407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/727243683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4570#issuecomment-727243683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4570","id":727243683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzI0MzY4Mw==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-14T18:02:03Z","updated_at":"2020-11-14T18:02:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfrazee

LGTM +1. I have reviewed the PR and was able to reproduce the issue. After implementing your changes, I confirmed when using a load balancer and the selected nifi instance is shut down, infinite login looping no longer occurs on the UI.

For custom advanced UIs that the community may develop/use, they will need to be accessed anonymously by enabling the \"nifi.security.allow.anonymous.authentication\" property. This reduces the list maintenance requirement a little bit, but does not eliminate it. It's possible that the list could be cut down by my manually looking at the resources that need to be allowed, in the UI, to check what is not accessible and enabling only those. From memory it was at least a few CSS files that caused the bigger issues. As far as wildcarding some of this, it was recommended to be explicit on the file name and not to use patterns. Maybe we can get @alopresto to chime in and see what he thinks of my approach to this PR.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I do believe that moving towards using a cookie for storing the JWT in the browser may be a reasonable option. I've been researching the benefits vs risks, the details of which I'm still collating.

I've compiled my comments alongside the logs I saw for different tests I tried. Let me know if you can't access: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAbM4LLA3NgRjKAfCXg7GqS8dvJnFA6sajrAkBezMt4/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nI think with this tool, the key things to focus on should be these:\r\n\r\n- The tool is being created to assist users with checking configuration that can be difficult to get right. The tool needs to be easy to use. The usage guide of the tool wasn't completely clear when I tried out using it.\r\n- The tool diagnoses errors with configuration, so the tool itself needs to be error free (as best as possible). Otherwise if there are errors with the tool, how will a user (a user who may already be struggling to get their configuration right) know whether the tool is to blame or the configuration is to blame? It needs to be pretty robust.\r\n- Sometimes I got a summary of results, sometimes I didn't, depending on what error the tool experienced. It wasn't immediately clear if the tool failed, or my configuration did. We need to gracefully fail. In as many cases as possible, there should always some form of diagnosis summary at the end of running the tool with information on how to proceed/fix the problem. \r\n\r\nI can appreciate that the tls-toolkit code as it stands needs redesigning/refactoring, and maybe you can let me know if the above feature requests are difficult to implement with the way it is right now. However, we should do our absolute best to make sure this diagnosis tool is robust as possible. A tool that diagnoses errors should have few errors of its own, and its correct usage should be clear and simple. Ideally, we don't want to have to provide support to users on how to use a tool that was created to support them in the first place.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, this is a great idea and I think with a few adjustments it will be really useful to diagnose problems our users frequently have. Especially so if we can do a more complex option for clustered nodes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/730635492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/730929288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4667#issuecomment-730929288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4667","id":730929288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDkyOTI4OA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T06:48:06Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T06:48:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @ChrisSamo632 for the changes and @pvillard31 for pinging me.

It is my opinion that the additional memory needed to add the additional FF summaries would be negligible as the FF summaries are a predictable size.

The current mechanism results in no more than 100 items being returned.  That was chosen because flowfile's can have arbitrarily large attributes (and while it is an anti pattern many users do this).  Making it larger such that it matches the swap threshold (which wasn't designed to care about this case) means you must ensure the implications for memory changes are considered.  My understanding of how this works does not align to your statement of it being negligible.  My understanding is that if there are 20,000 flowfiles or lets say 100,000 flowfiles in there and they're lets say '1KB each' in terms of text to represent them we're looking at *at least* 16-80 or so MB of heap.

I agree with you that the underlying issue is related to using `java.sql.Date` for representing dates without times.\r\n\r\nLooking at the unit test you referenced in TestConvertRecord and stepping through the code, it looks like the better place to address the problem is in `DataTypeUtils.toDate()` where `DateFormat.parse()` creates a `java.util.Date`.  As you described, when walking through the unit test, the parse result returns a `java.util.Date` with a local time zone, which skews the resulting `java.sql.Date`.  Replacing DateFormat with `LocalDate.parse()` and using `java.sql.Date.valueOf()` avoids the skewed return value.  Making the change at that level would avoid the need to readjust values later on.\r\n\r\nMaking the change in `DataTypeUtils.toDate()` will probably have other consequences, but that seems like it is worth considering to get to the root of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/731351810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/731356318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4641#issuecomment-731356318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4641","id":731356318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTM1NjMxOA==","user":{"login":"anaylor","id":61026014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDI2MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61026014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor","html_url":"https://github.com/anaylor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anaylor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T19:09:11Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T19:09:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I did not realize flowfiles could have arbitrarily large attributes, I only tested with default flow file attributes.

If that reconnection is successful, then the node can remain part of the cluster. This is done because there are some changes that can happen that our fingerprinting logic says is okay. For example, if the position of a component moves, or if a component is stopped. Upon cluster reconnect, the joining node will simply update that component to match the cluster. For other changes, such as a processor property change, fingerprinting logic will prevent the node from joining, and the node will then transition to a DISCONNECTED state.\r\n\r\nWhen that change initially happens, because the node will immediately attempt to connect to the cluster again, it transitions from CONNECTED to CONNECTING (not DISCONNECTED). As a result, it does not relinquish any roles that it holds as Primary Node / Cluster Coordinator. This results in an issue where the Cluster Coordinator may fail to update a component and as such has an old Revision number and then attempts to connect to the Cluster. The node is allowed to join and downloads the list of Component Revisions from the Cluster Coordinator. BUT, in this situation, the Cluster Coordinator is the node with the outdated Component Revisions, so it never gets the list that the rest of the cluster has.\r\n\r\nThis fix addresses the issue by making the node relinquish any roles that it holds (Cluster Coordinator, Primary Node) so that another node will pick up the roles.
