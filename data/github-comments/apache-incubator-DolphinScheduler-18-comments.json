> 跨项目依赖在1.2.0中已经实现了\r\n> \r\n> 好的，这个是目前遇到的最大的问题，还有很多地方最好能微调下，我有很多使用过程中的建议，如果能采纳，那这将会是一个了不起的项目。\r\n> 例如：\r\n> 1.分页查看，每页固定10条，我觉得很不合理，至少要留给用户一个可选的条数。\r\n> 2.批量上线下线的问题\r\n> 3.用户创建shell任务的界面，右边弹出的框太小了，我的shell经常会写的很长，要拖到最下面才有进度条来查看后面的内容。你至少要留给我很大空间能够让我看到我的命令，或者就放弃这种右边弹框的方式，直接正中央弹出，并且这个弹框是可以随意移动，可以伸缩大小的，这样就不要纠结shell长度的问题。\r\n> 4.创建shell任务界面的时候，所有东西都填好了，不小心在左边空白处，点了下鼠标，弹框就缩回去了，然后我填的很多东西都没有了，我很气知道么，好多次就是这样，我填了一大堆，然后就没了，我觉得应该给用户一个关闭当前弹框的按钮，而不是不小心点击了空白界面就什么都没有了。\r\n> 5.还是shell创建页面，如果我填了很多东西，突然我想放弃这次任务，我点击了chrome左上角的后退按钮，返回到了“工作流定义”界面，这个时候弹框还会存在，我觉得这是个界面BUG。\r\n> 6.设置定时任务点击“执行时间”按钮，会导致API使用内存不释放，导致闪退，只能重启服务，这个问题可能会修复。\r\n> 7.建立Dependent任务时，我的任务名字会很长，回显shell名称那里，太长的任务名字显示不了，找不到哪个是我想要的，只能输入名字精确搜索，这里应该要优化一下，至少让用户能完整的看到任务名称，或者把鼠标移上去，能显示完整的名称。\r\n> 8.我觉得建立子任务名称，不应该叫节点名称，让人很容易想成是物理机节点名称，一个Job下由多个Task组成工作流,而那里应该改为TaskName(任务名称),而不是NodeName(节点名称)。\r\n> 9.应该让管理员控制每个账户有哪些可选的work工作组，我们之前发生了一件事，就是本来在大数据平台的建表任务，阴差阳错跑到TiDB上建表了，首先能确定你是在什么平台跑数据的，然后只授权一个默认的work工作组，，如果需要连接多个地方，在授权这个账户多个work工作组。\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggestion, we have fixed a part in
