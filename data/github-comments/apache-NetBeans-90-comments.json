I think the problem is in `org.netbeans.modules.projectapi.LazyLookupProviders` and that [call to setLookups](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/projectapi/src/org/netbeans/modules/projectapi/LazyLookupProviders.java#L97) that is done holding the conditional lock.\r\n\r\nI'll have a think about a test for that scenario if you need one, but it's what the stack trace seems to suggest ? ...\r\n\r\n> Btw. I don't see any dump where lock are stuck in collectFires(). Please point me where you see something like that.\r\n\r\nI mean the thread with the lock from DelegatingLookupImpl is stuck in collectFires() rather than in calling through to its listeners.  eg. all the stack traces show the following similar (trimmed) stack, with resultChanged() being called in DelegatingLookupImpl fired under the lock from one LazyLookupProviders proxy, taking the lock in DelegatingLookupImpl, then waiting on the lock in another LazyLookupProviders proxy during a call to collectFires().\r\n\r\n```\r\n        at org.netbeans.modules.projectapi.LazyLookupProviders$1Prov$1.beforeLookup(LazyLookupProviders.java:84)\r\n        - waiting to re-lock in wait() <0x0000000601a8dca0> (a [Ljava.lang.Thread;)\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup.beforeLookup(ProxyLookup.java:268)\r\n        .....\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup$R.collectFires(ProxyLookup.java:645)\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup.setLookups(ProxyLookup.java:228)\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup.setLookups(ProxyLookup.java:184)\r\n        at org.netbeans.spi.project.support.DelegatingLookupImpl.doDelegate(DelegatingLookupImpl.java:168)\r\n        - locked <0x0000000601a8ef08> (a java.util.ArrayList)\r\n        at org.netbeans.spi.project.support.DelegatingLookupImpl.resultChanged(DelegatingLookupImpl.java:84)\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup$1Notify.run(ProxyLookup.java:239)\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup.setLookups(ProxyLookup.java:248)\r\n        at org.openide.util.lookup.ProxyLookup.setLookups(ProxyLookup.java:184)\r\n        at org.netbeans.modules.projectapi.LazyLookupProviders$1Prov$1.beforeLookup(LazyLookupProviders.java:97)\r\n```\r\n\r\nVarious of the other threads waiting on the lock in DelegatingLookupImpl are also being called under lock from a LazyLookupProvider proxy, presumably one of which is the one the above stack is waiting for.  I'm not sure there's an easy way to ascertain which from a stack trace with this sort of conditional lock?

The changes to the messages are great. For the hint, I guess I agree it should be on one line only (or, as far as I am concerned, disabled). But if it is a suggestion/`Hint.Kind.ACTION`, it will not be usable in Inspect&Transform, which is not much desirable.\r\n\r\nSo, my suggestion would be:\r\n-keep the `severity = Severity.HINT`, that should make the hint work on the current line only\r\n-drop both `minSourceVersion = \"13\"` (as it does not make sense anyway) and `hintKind = Hint.Kind.ACTION`\r\n-change the category to `rules15`\r\n\r\nI think this should make the warning appear only if the caret is inside the span that would be converted.
