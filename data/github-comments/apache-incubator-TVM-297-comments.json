There are usecases in AutoTIR where we want to call back to python in a multi-threaded C++ environment (with GIL). In this case, C++ threads need to be properly initialized by calling [several python's stable APIs](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#non-python-created-threads). However, in fact we don't want to include `Python.h` because strictly speaking TVM is not designed to depend on python.\r\n\r\nActually It's not a strict dependency, and we can completely avoid doing this in AutoTIR, but I'm just so curious, so TQ points me to this PR.

But one big use case for cutlass BYOC is for dynamic workloads, for which we cannot do well at the moment. I think C source backend is not compatible with dynamic inputs, is that right? On the other hand, with json codegen/runtime, I can see a way to support dynamic inputs.\r\n\r\nHowever, since cutlass is a template library, the only way it could work with the json codegen/runtime is to instantiate all possible templates that we care about ahead of time, and build them together with `libtvm.so`. I wonder if that is feasible. cc @Laurawly\r\nOne benefit of the above approach is that we don't need to commit the cutlass code generator into our repo, which is a big part of this PR.

On the other hand, dynamic workloads are still challenging, and hopefully our ongoing efforts of dynamic kernel tuning and generation could be landed soon to make it happen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942064270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942146086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9261#issuecomment-942146086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9261","id":942146086,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44KAIm","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-13T10:15:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T10:15:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hmm, are you concerned about slow performance due to lack of tuning, or the integration problem that I brought up?

The interface of C source codegen does deal with dynamic workloads, because it takes the raw pointer which could be any size in run time.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was how to generate CUTLASS kernels that are able to perform well with all shapes. In @Laurawly's post, they generate lots of kernels to cover possible shapes, which result in 7GB binary. I assume they also generate a run time dispatching logic (also in the generated C source code) to determine which kernel should be used given the known shape in run time. Obviously, the binary size will definitely be an issue for this solution.\r\n\r\nFor JSON codegen/runtime, it would be similar to TensorRT: We simply dump a JSON graph in codegen without doing anything else. Meanwhile, we have a custom runtime that JITs/catches CUTLASS kernels based on known shapes. This results in a much smaller binary, but the first execution (or an execution with new shapes) may take several seconds or even a minute to JIT all kernels.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942488532/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942512206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9103#issuecomment-942512206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9103","id":942512206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44LZhO","user":{"login":"mikepapadim","id":8652854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTI4NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8652854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim","html_url":"https://github.com/mikepapadim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikepapadim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-13T17:01:12Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T17:01:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbs-octoml @jroesch @tqchen  this can be merged now\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942512206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942520731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9270#issuecomment-942520731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9270","id":942520731,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44Lbmb","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-13T17:03:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T17:03:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Mousius do you have an idea how much larger this makes ci-cpu?

Without such estimate, or if the estimate turns out to be off, we just fallback to a default kernel that works on any input shapes, which shouldn't be too slow anyway since it is cutlass, not TVM :) This should be a reasonable trade off between performance and convenience of dynamic models: if they want to run fast on dynamic models, they need to help us, otherwise we cannot guarantee good performance.\r\n\r\nI believe even if a network contains many dynamic workloads, there is only one underlying dynamism, from which other dynamic shapes can be derived. For example, MaskRCNN contains some dynamic batch dense, conv2d and conv2d transpose, but all dynamic dims directly correspond to the number of boxes detected, or some numbers derived from it. For transformers, I guess the true dynamism is only in sequence length. So I think it wouldn't be too much of an ask to give an estimate of such numbers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942895664/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/942918101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9273#issuecomment-942918101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9273","id":942918101,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM44M8nV","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T03:42:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T03:42:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i

This loader is a stripped version of original dyld loader with dropping a lot of functionality which is out of TVM needs. Particularly it supports only one format of storing export symbols inside a mach-o binary (via DYLD_INFO section). Before iOS 15 it was a default variant of binaries used for iOS. But recently default behaviour was changed in Xcode 13. Now linker uses CHAINED_FIXUPS format if you are targeting on iOS 15 and later.
