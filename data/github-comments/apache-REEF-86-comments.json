Thanks a lot for your comments. I have discussed with the REEF folks in our lab and @scan3. Here's the summary.\r\n\r\n* Adding a generic API in REEF is beneficial in that REEF developers can specify the constraints of the nodes without being aware of the APIs of each RM clients. I got the feedback from the REEF folks in SNU that it is quite annoying to use RM client APIs directly in REEF applications.\r\n* However, I also agree that current key-value API could be misleading, and not general enough too. (in case that we support other RMs which specify node contrains in a way that cannot be expressed as the key-value map)\r\n* I agree that the name \"Scheduling Constraint\" is better than \"Node Labeling\". @scan3 will change the name.\r\n\r\nSo, my suggestion is changing the current way of designating node constrains(key-value maps) into more general way. We can make a new interface, called `SchedulingContraint` and make the implementation classes like `YarnSchedulingConstraint` and `MesosSchedulingConstraint` for setting RM-specific constraints through their own builders. `EvaluatorRequestor` will get the `SchedulingConstraint` from `setSchedulingConstraint()` method.\r\n\r\n@markusweimer Would you please let me know whether my answer is enough for your question and how you think about the new plan?
