I see there is a install cypress script: `\"install-cypress\": \"npm install cypress@3.4.1\"`. My guess is that whoever updated the package lock file last had run that command before. \r\n\r\nI ran the script, and since I'm running npm5 (which defaults to `--save`), cypress was added as a dependency in package.json. Do you know if there's a reason/history for the `install-cypress` script and not just listing it as a dependency?  Additionally do you know if there's a reason for _not_ list it as a dependency?\r\n\r\nI've updated the pr with what happened after I:\r\n- `npm run install-cypress`\r\n- `npm install`\r\n- `git rebase master`\r\n\r\nLooks like now I'm adding cypress in both package.json and package-lock.json \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/554558949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/554575377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8563#issuecomment-554575377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8563","id":554575377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDU3NTM3Nw==","user":{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-15T23:59:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T23:59:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that's enough for one PR...

There's actually no linting enforcement for CSS. If you run `lint-fix` it will run Prettier and auto-format the CSS, but the `lint` command doesn't do anything with prettier. So nothing should break, but there's an easy means to clean stuff up. \r\n\r\nIn parallel, I'm slowly starting rules for Stylelint to make issues more apparent in IDEs. Once the rules gel a little bit, we can consider adding lint enforcement of CSS to the build process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/555849475/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/555849501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8536#issuecomment-555849501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8536","id":555849501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTg0OTUwMQ==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T05:49:24Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T05:49:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nudging testers/reviewers, would be great to get 👀 on this to kill this long standing bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/555849501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/555860660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8348#issuecomment-555860660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8348","id":555860660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTg2MDY2MA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-20T06:32:41Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T06:32:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I also sank some time trying to solve this CSS puzzle without success.
