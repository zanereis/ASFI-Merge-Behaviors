I'm attempting to consider how to fit it in amongst existing abstractions we have, which I think is really important. Too many abstractions gets too confusing and unmaintainable.\n\nThinking out loud, we have:\n- DimensionSpec, used for creating DimensionSelectors from CursorSelectorFactorys, which provide access to (possibly transformed / filtered) values and to the dictionary (if no transformation)\n- ExtractionFn, used for transforming single values to strings. #3091 would add support for transforming multiple values to strings.\n- AggregatorFactory, used for applying aggregation functions on CursorSelectorFactorys; can read anything and return anything.\n- Expressions, used for creating NumericColumnSelectors from CursorSelectorFactorys, added in #2783.\n\nCan we combine VirtualColumns and expressions? i.e. would it make sense, on CursorSelectorFactory, to get rid of:\n\n``` java\nNumericColumnSelector makeMathExpressionSelector(String expression)\n```\n\nand instead, add:\n\n``` java\nObjectColumnSelector makeObjectColumnSelector(VirtualColumn virtualColumn)\n```\n\nI think that'd work for the map use case mentioned in the PR description as well as math expressions. For expressions, instead of `csf.makeMathExpressionSelector(expr)` a caller would do `makeObjectColumnSelector(new ExpressionVirtualColumn(expr))`. The returned ObjectColumnSelector would have classOfObject() as Number.class. Maybe also call VirtualColumns \"ObjectSelectorSpecs\" to draw attention to the similarity between them and DimensionSpecs.\n\nI think this could make sense if it's possible to have a virtual column impl of making a math expression selector. This, I guess, would involve calling `makeObjectColumnSelector(foo)` on all the identifiers \"foo\" that the expression uses and then doing something reasonable with that. Could also help reduce code duplication in the column selector factories.\n\nI haven't totally thought this through but if it works it sounds good to me‚Ä¶\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/258055542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/258056273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2836#issuecomment-258056273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2836","id":258056273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODA1NjI3Mw==","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T03:10:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T03:10:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"üëç \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/258056273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/258056771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3622#issuecomment-258056771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3622","id":258056771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODA1Njc3MQ==","user":{"login":"hamlet-lee","id":12079531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDc5NTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12079531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/hamlet-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hamlet-lee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T03:16:17Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T03:16:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@niketh when the MM shuts down, is the lock for a ingesting datasource released?
