But I would also like to open an issueÂ for the future to clarify the BufferAggregator contract â it sounds like it's pretty confusing what it allows and doesn't allow âÂ and then use that clarified contract to optimize SketchBufferAggregator more after 0.10.0.\r\n\r\n> @akashdw @himanshug this is BDUF. Possible redesign of BufferGrouper which won't include \"rehash\" will make relocate() obsolete as well, so rework of SketchBufferAggregator will be needed anyway.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's BDUF, since `Query` and `BufferAggregator` are both valid extension points for Druid extensions, and we can't assume we can control all possible implementations. We need the interfaces to be clear about what is allowed and disallowed, and we shouldn't write code that violates them, or else users' site specific custom Queries and Aggregators might not work properly.\r\n\r\nEven future code written as part of Druid might not work properly, after we all put this behind us and forget that SketchBufferAggregator doesn't quite follow the contract 100%. This is actually how we got into this situation in the first place! When I wrote groupBy v2, I used BufferAggregator interface in a way that other queries hadn't done before, which I thought satisfied the contract, but broke SketchBufferAggregator. Arguably, the old version of SketchBufferAggregator didn't follow the contract, but it was \"OK\" until the change to groupBy.\r\n\r\nSo, I think the maps are useful and it's valid choice to be a little \"flexible\" until the BufferAggregator interface is clarified.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288534926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288539614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3954#issuecomment-288539614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3954","id":288539614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODUzOTYxNA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-22T21:06:00Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T21:06:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@gianm addressed comments, thanks for review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288539614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/288542595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4079#issuecomment-288542595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4079","id":288542595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODU0MjU5NQ==","user":{"login":"egor-ryashin","id":14215045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin","html_url":"https://github.com/egor-ryashin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-22T21:17:12Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T21:17:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When we reach the global limit here, we begin to spam to logs on each call\r\n```\r\n     @Override\r\n     public void run()\r\n     {\r\n       try {\r\n         T specialized;\r\n         if (specializedClassCounter.get() > maxSpecializations) {\r\n           // Don't specialize, just instantiate the prototype class and emit a warning.\r\n           // The \"better\" approach is probably to implement some kind of cache eviction from\r\n           // PerPrototypeClassState.specializationStates.
