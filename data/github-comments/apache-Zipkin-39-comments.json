I don't know DataStax policy (if it is the same or not).\n\nThe commit prior to mine doesn't work on 3.7 incidentally, due to missing `org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.TimeWindowCompactionStrategy`. Let's not forget the lesson we learned in #706 where @liyichao raised an issue because of an awkward error. If we insist on bleeding edge, we should query the server or rewrite the error to help people who don't realize the minimum version requirements.\n\nAnyway, all this in mind.. I feel confident that the \"model\" can work across both 3.0.8 and 3.9+. As long as we can identify via metadata or exception the version, we can also setup SASI on the duration field transparently. I'm not sure about the \"annotation_keys     set<text>\" field, as I don't know if you can SASI a collection, but then again, we don't have a full-text search api either.\n\nFood for thought.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/245147435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/245149755","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1252#issuecomment-245149755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1252","id":245149755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTE0OTc1NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-07T01:39:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T01:39:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK I just looked.

I don't get why you want to. We already support an older versions (ie Cassandra-2.2), so there simply isn't any need to provide interim support for Cassandra-3.0.x. This is not a PR that's discussing or proposing that we drop the Cassandra-2.2 datamodel.\n\nSo we're both looking at this as \"how do we minimize support and complexity\" but from very different angles.\n\nIf this PR only targets 3.9+ \n- then the code is simpler\n- there's less data-models out there that we have to support,\n- the adoption of the new 3.9 data-model (or migration from the 2.2 datamodel) will be more gradual,  and from only vanilla Cassandra installations,\n- includes Cassandra that can do self-tracing (just a bonus thrown in really).\n\nThese things make it easier to support it. Significantly easier if you ask me. So we're arguing for the same goal (i believe) in completely opposite directions. Honestly I had thought about the optional SASI approach so that we could target 3.0.8, but it just adds complexity, and seems a premature thing to do at this stage since Cassandra-2.2 remains fully supported. I really think that it's advantageous to avoid pushing all those Cassandra-2.2 users as quickly as possible onto this. If it ain't broke don't fix it, which gives us time to mature such a big change appropriately and at the same time provides a lot of clean horizon for the new data model.\n\n>   rewrite the dependency graph\n>    redo docker to support this\n>    support users when they come in asking about how this works\n\nI am happy to take responsibility for these things. I will ask for some help on the docker i'm sure. And you'll need to grab me when users need help, because I don't constantly read gitter. But grab me and I will help those in need.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/245175994/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/245183941","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1252#issuecomment-245183941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1252","id":245183941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTE4Mzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-07T06:05:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T08:06:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The only flaw in this logic is the assumption that 2.2 is supportable.
