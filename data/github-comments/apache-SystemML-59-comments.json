have added the following API design notes to the JIRA:\r\n\r\n1. Row aggregation: remove duplicate rows\r\n\r\n    * R: unique() removes duplicate rows, eg\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n        > df <- matrix(rep(1:6,length.out=9),nrow = 3,ncol=3,byrow = T)\r\n        > df\r\n            [,1] [,2] [,3]\r\n        [1,]    1    2    3\r\n        [2,]    4    5    6\r\n        [3,]    1    2    3\r\n        > unique(df)\r\n            [,1] [,2] [,3]\r\n        [1,]    1    2    3\r\n        [2,]    4    5    6\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * SystemDS: the same can be achieved using the unique() sketch like so:\r\n\r\n        unique(X, dir=\"r\")\r\n\r\n2. Col aggregation: remove duplicate cols\r\n\r\n    * R: unique() removes duplicate rows, so we can obtain the desired result using transpose, like so:\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n        > df <- matrix(rep(1:6,length.out=9),nrow = 3,ncol=3)\r\n        > df\r\n            [,1] [,2] [,3]\r\n        [1,]    1    4    1\r\n        [2,]    2    5    2\r\n        [3,]    3    6    3\r\n        > df_t\r\n            [,1] [,2] [,3]\r\n        [1,]    1    2    3\r\n        [2,]    4    5    6\r\n        [3,]    1    2    3\r\n        > df_t_ = unique(df_t)\r\n        > df_t_\r\n            [,1] [,2] [,3]\r\n        [1,]    1    2    3\r\n        [2,]    4    5    6\r\n        > df_t_t = t(df_t_)\r\n        > df_t_t\r\n            [,1] [,2]\r\n        [1,]    1    4\r\n        [2,]    2    5\r\n        [3,]    3    6\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * SystemDS: the same can be achieved using the unique() sketch like so:\r\n\r\n        unique(X, dir=\"c\")\r\n\r\n3. RowCol aggregation: return only unique values in given matrix\r\n\r\n    * SystemDS\r\n\r\n        X = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]\r\n        unique(X) will return X' = [[1], [2], [3]]\r\n    \r\n    * R\r\n\r\n    This is similar to how unique() operates on vectors in R:\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n        > df <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)\r\n        > df\r\n        [1] 1 1 2 2 3 3\r\n        > unique(df)\r\n        [1] 1 2 3\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    The difference is that SystemDS' unique() will support the same for not only vectors, but also matrices.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1330084042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1341239833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1748#issuecomment-1341239833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1748","id":1341239833,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5P8bIZ","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T16:30:26Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T16:30:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I suggest to associate a Jira task with this commit instead of a MINOR.

Using ubuntu-latest could break reproducibility when new versions of ubuntu are added. I'd replace all calls to ubuntu-latest with ubuntu-22.04.\r\n2. The applications-tests do not use setup-java and therefore use the default java installation of ubuntu-22.04, so if not replacing ubuntu-latest with a fixed version, I'd at least want to add a fixed version with setup java, but maybe even pin both a version for java and ubuntu.\r\n3. Maybe also combine the functions, components and applications matricies into a shared matrix in order to avoid their matrix test groups from diverging, unless their matricies should remain different? I don't know enough about the project to say if this step would make sense.\r\n4. Retention period for artifacts, the uploaded test-coverage reports may be saved for up to 400 days as artifacts. I don't think they have a ton of value to keep around that long since they can also be regenerated. I'd consider setting the retention long enough to make sure it is around at least a bit longer than it takes to get something merged, but I don't know how long this is for this project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1519035420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1519052864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1806#issuecomment-1519052864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1806","id":1519052864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5aiuhA","user":{"login":"kykrueger","id":7158199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTgxOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7158199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger","html_url":"https://github.com/kykrueger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kykrueger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-23T12:12:03Z","updated_at":"2023-04-23T12:12:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It turns out that adding a custom status badge to the readme is a bit annoying since it needs to be saved somewhere, we have a few options:\r\n1. Commit the status badge after the tests are successful. This creates some issues around the nature of open source projects, where you will have lots of branches coming from outside and the contributors will have to give the workflow permissions to commit to their branch. You will also need to give the workflows permission to commit inside of the github project. This also opens up a bit of a vulnerability for unintentional changes + a noisy commit history unless you switch to squash merging.\r\n2. Host the status badge in some sort of cloud storage, and only let your workflows update it. Someone will need to provide an object storage account and add a secret in your github workflows, I can't do that myself from outside the project. This would also only work to display the most recent badge of main (could be misleading for forks). Someone had a neat solution of using gists to do this for free: https://discuss.circleci.com/t/how-to-show-badge-from-artifacts-in-github-readme/42109/2\r\n3.
