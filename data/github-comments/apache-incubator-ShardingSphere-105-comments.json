I can't understand it. The situation is like this. I need to shard databases at present, and I don't need to shard tables. Now there are many tables with the sharding-column, which can be divided to the database. I need to configure actual-data-nodes for all of these tables to query. If you don't configure them, an error will be reported.  Can you tell me how to simplify the configuration？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/597558247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/597568121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4711#issuecomment-597568121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4711","id":597568121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzU2ODEyMQ==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T10:58:53Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T10:58:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There

You know, TIDB can handle sharding tables, which is similar to ShardingSphere.\r\nSo I am curious why you want to adopt Sharding Proxy and TIDB together?\r\n\r\nActually, Sharding Proxy can understand
