For real-time ingested data, the partition must match the upstream partition id to ensure the upsert assumption of all data of the same partition served by the same server, and I don't think we can loose this requirement.\r\n\r\nYes, this is not supposed to be changed, but here we are getting the partition id from upstream instead of Pinot applying any partition function on primary key column to find the partition id.\r\nSimilarly, we should have capability to provide a partition id for uploaded segment. Since the partitioning of data is being done externally and can provide the partition id for uplaoded segments as well.\r\n\r\n> Partition function is required for partition pruning. If partition pruning is not required, then we may allow custom partition id without a partition function.\r\n\r\nThis should be doable with upstream configuration that one should use a partition function from Pinot's list and on a table's column.\r\n\r\nSince Pinot has not restricted which partition function to use in the upstream for creating upsert tables, we have use cases that can use custom partition functions, these use-cases also don't need partition pruning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2071862075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2071881575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10919#issuecomment-2071881575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10919","id":2071881575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c57fmdn","user":{"login":"hpvd","id":5681880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODE4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5681880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd","html_url":"https://github.com/hpvd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-23T09:50:09Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T09:52:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Release video: Apache Pinot 1.1 | Overview of Latest Features and Updates \r\ntalks also about vector index support brought by:\r\nSupport Vector index and HNSW as the first implementation #11977 \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSwPtOajsGY&t=1m20s","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2071881575/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2071920309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/12987#issuecomment-2071920309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12987","id":2071920309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c57fv61","user":{"login":"tibrewalpratik17","id":23629228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjI5MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23629228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17","html_url":"https://github.com/tibrewalpratik17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibrewalpratik17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-23T10:08:00Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Provide partition id externally:\r\nOption 1: Provide partition id as http headers during segment upload\r\nOption 2: Provide partition id as part of uploaded segment metadata(not as columnPartitionMap) (metadata.properties)\r\n\r\nIMO if we go for option-2, then we should be consistent to add this / update this metadata for all present segments too.

But previous commits failed in other cases.\r\n\r\nBasically it looks like there is a concurrency issue if we remove the Synchronized map in `StatMap`. Specifically, I was able to reproduce it by running one of the test that failed 1000 times in a loop. After a couple of minutes it failed. In that case, it always failed in the stats of the leaf operator. In that operator I modify the StatMap in the constructor.\r\n\r\nI have to say that in that version of the code the StatMap was initialized in the super class, so maybe the constructor with final attribute was not applying by then. Now that it applies, it may be the case that we don't need to actually synchronize, but I wouldn't feel very comfortable relaying on that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2075217016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2075451380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12955#issuecomment-2075451380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12955","id":2075451380,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c57tN_0","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-24T17:15:30Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T17:15:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I've created this PR mainly to have a nicer message in some cases.

Following the same logic in #11857 should work. Basically when downgrading and Pinot doesn't understand the new format, it should try to generate the old format\r\n\r\nI think, in this case, it's failing because we are generating the [segment based on updated](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/99a41803305a39887805e1106f90d07e4b6af978/pinot-compatibility-verifier/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/compat/SegmentOp.java#L183) Lucene library-based code using codec99, and for [uploading](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/99a41803305a39887805e1106f90d07e4b6af978/pinot-compatibility-verifier/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/compat/SegmentOp.java#L222) using the old library based code.  So while, uploading we are getting this error\r\n```bash\r\n2024/04/17 02:28:04.193 INFO [StartServiceManagerCommand] [Start a Pinot [SERVER]] Started Pinot [SERVER] instance [Server_10.1.0.40_8098] at 9.332s since launch\r\n2024/04/17 02:38:12.482 ERROR [LuceneTextIndexReader] [HelixTaskExecutor-message_handle_thread_4] Failed to instantiate Lucene text index reader for column textDim1, exception Could not load codec 'Lucene99'.

Instead, at disk level, this type is just a normal timestamp. As explained by [the doc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-DATETIME-INPUT-TIME-STAMPS):\r\n\r\n> For timestamp with time zone, the internally stored value is always in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time, traditionally known as Greenwich Mean Time, GMT). An input value that has an explicit time zone specified is converted to UTC using the appropriate offset for that time zone. If no time zone is stated in the input string, then it is assumed to be in the time zone indicated by the system's [TimeZone](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-TIMEZONE) parameter, and is converted to UTC using the offset for the timezone zone.\r\n\r\n> When a timestamp with time zone value is output, it is always converted from UTC to the current timezone zone, and displayed as local time in that zone. To see the time in another time zone, either change timezone or use the AT TIME ZONE construct (see [Section 9.9.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-ZONECONVERT)).\r\n\r\n> Conversions between timestamp without time zone and timestamp with time zone normally assume that the timestamp without time zone value should be taken or given as timezone local time. A different time zone can be specified for the conversion using AT TIME ZONE.\r\n\r\nSo basically the timezone feature is mostly a frontend property. When timezone is included in the type, values are converted to UTC. When timezone is not included, the received timezone is considered to be based on the server timezone.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2076493793/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2076503675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12955#issuecomment-2076503675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12955","id":2076503675,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c57xO57","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-25T07:00:08Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T07:00:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> How about we introducing a util which takes the pipe format mailbox id and convert it to the pretty format? Then we can use it when we want a nicer message.\r\n\r\nI think that goes against the idea you explained in the first comment and in fact that is similar to what this PR does. IICU your first comment, you indicated that you think in the future we may change the format of the mailbox id to something that does not carry the same information. If that is the case, we cannot assume that in the future we are going to be able to extract, from the mailbox id, the stage and other information that can be useful in the messages.\r\n\r\nMaybe what you wanted to say is that we may want to change the format (but not the content) of the mailbox id in the future. In that case this current proposed implementation is fine because this PR does not modify the format used to send the mailbox id in the binary protocol. Instead it keeps in memory a MailboxId object but when it is serialized/deserialized it is converted to the current string form.\r\n\r\nSo instead of having to use a util to extract a human description from the current mailbox id, this PR extracts the information beforehand when the message is deserialized and keeps it in memory. Given the information carried by the mailbox id is mostly integers, this object representation is probably more memory efficient than the String and it is for sure easier to read (for example, having a `List<MailboxId>` is easier to understand than `List<String>`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2076503675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2076651823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12783#issuecomment-2076651823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12783","id":2076651823,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c57xzEv","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-25T08:30:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T08:30:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've applied the suggested changes.

Rebalance itself should be idempotent, and rerunning it should return immediately if it is already balanced \r\n\r\nRight, rerunning returned as noop immediately. But it didn't post any job status if it's noop, so RebalanceChecker would continue to see the failure job status and retry again, entering a loop until either 1) the job status is cleaned up; 2) the table actually gets imbalanced and causes a real rebalance to happen, when new job status is posted overriding the failure status.\r\n\r\nEnhancing the cleanup mechanism would not work due to the edge case of noop as above. Because cleanup of job status is done while posting new job status. So if it's noop, no job status is posted at all, and no cleanup happens.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can post job status even for noop. Then, the noop status can override the old failure status. fyi, this stmt to post the first status for a rebalance job is after all checks for noop.\r\n```\r\n    _tableRebalanceObserver.onTrigger(TableRebalanceObserver.Trigger.START_TRIGGER, currentAssignment,\r\n        targetAssignment);\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2080241027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2080244185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13016#issuecomment-2080244185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13016","id":2080244185,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c57_gHZ","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-26T23:55:11Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T23:55:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Based on the analysis, the root problem is that the no-op rerun won't update the job status.

If Java's built in regular expressions have the edge _somewhere_, it's probably a pretty small edge, and it would be nice to avoid backtracking by default.\r\n\r\nI don't have a good understanding of how Pinot's users use regex, but from searching it seems that the median latency/memory usage of re2j is higher than Java's built in library. It'd also become a backwards incompatible change due to feature gaps. In general I don't _think_ users would be primarily using Pinot for regex filtering (i.e. should we have an optimized path for the average case or focus on worst case performance?), but that's my conjecture. \r\n\r\nSome references: \r\nhttps://github.com/DaniilRoman/re2j_test\r\nhttps://github.com/google/re2j/issues/162\r\nhttps://github.com/google/re2j/issues/12\r\n\r\nIf there is a consensus that an outright replacement is acceptable I'm happy to go that route.
