Maxime,\r\n\r\nThanks for merging the PR. When looked online for similar issues, the closest one I can find is this one:\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1106\r\nThey solve it by including `Flask>=0.10.1` as a dependancy so the `flask_appbuilder` can still decide on the version. Personally I would recommend to pin the version, this makes debugging easier because everyone is running the same version of Flask.\r\n\r\nTo get back to your question, I do not use `pip install superset`, but I build it from source [as described](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html#making-your-own-build):\r\n```\r\napt-get update \\\r\n&& apt-get install -y npm git build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev nodejs-legacy python-dev python-pip \\\r\n&& pip install --upgrade setuptools pip \\\r\n&& npm install -g npm@'>=5.0.3' \\\r\n&& git clone https://github.com/Fokko/incubator-superset.git $SUPERSET_HOME \\\r\n&& cd $SUPERSET_HOME/superset/assets \\\r\n&& npm install \\\r\n&& npm run build \\\r\n&& cd $SUPERSET_HOME \\\r\n&& python setup.py install\r\n```\r\nThis is happening in a clean Docker ubuntu image.\r\n\r\nCheers,
