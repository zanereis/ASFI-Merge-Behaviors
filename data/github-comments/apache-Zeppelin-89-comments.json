The main difference between them is where that interpreter is launched. `scoped` mode launches an interpreter with same process and different thread with its own class loader. Otherwise, `isolated` launches different process. `per user` and `per note` are dimensions to support those modes.\n\n@zjffdu I also agree we should try to reduce complexity, but we should try to keep user experience equally. Zeppelin's users are not only individuals but also enterprise. We should consider all of users' experience. And I already argued that issue with @Leemoonsoo, and we conclude that keeping current users' behaviour is more important than making them simple. I suggest we will start to discuss the breaking changes.

Nothing much needed. You can just copy and paste the below conf table to `markdown.md`.\n\n```\n## Configuration\n<table class=\"table-configuration\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Name</th>\n    <th>Default Value</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>markdown.parser.type</td>\n    <td>markdown4j </td>\n    <td>Markdown Parser Type. <br/> Available values: markdown4j, pegdown.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nAlso the below sentences in [Overview section](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/markdown.html#overview) need to be updated accordingly. \n\n> Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML.

So there's no way to apply per user config which related to SparkContext creation.\n- Interpreter authorization will be more complicated to take care individual configuration's permission.\n- Interpreter configuration itself becomes complicated. For example, there're per user interpreter config created.

I think what user care about is how to share the interpreter across notes/users. So we may change it to\n\n```\nThe interpreter is shared across ....\n```\n\nRegarding the scope of sharing, I think there's following 3 kinds:\n\n```\n-  Across users\n-  Across notes under one single user \n-  No sharing  ('isolated') (one Interpreter in one JVM for each note)\n```\n\nAnd regarding sharing method,  I think there's 2 ways to share:\n\n```\n-  One JVM One Interpreter `shared` (same interpreter namespace, everything is shared)\n-  One JVM Multiple Interpreter `scoped` (different interpreter namespace, only resource pool is shared, e.g. SparkContext)\n```\n\nNow, let's think about the first scenario. Assume we have enable shiro, and logging as user A. So user A want to change the setting of interpreter spark. Here's what he can choose\n\n```\n-  Nothing shared across notes\n-  Shared everything across notes\n-  Only share resource pool across notes\n```\n\nHe should not have permission to control whether this interpreter can be shared across users. Only the administrator can do that.\nNow, let's take a look at the second scenario, we log in as administrator.  He can create a new interpreter to make it shared across users. Here's what he can choose.\n\n```\n- Share everything across users  ( One Interpreter instance)\n- Only share resource pool across users (One Interpreter instance per note )\n- Share resource pool across users and share everything across notes under one user (One Interpreter instance per user)\n```\n\nActually I think the first scenario is the common case, the second scenario is very rare. \n\nOf course we have the third scenario, shiro is not enabled. Actually this is the same as the first scenario, as we don't have user here. Everything is under user anonymous. \n\nWe can rephrase these options later, just want to express it in the viewpoint of end users.\n- Second, Regarding `per user interpreter config`, I think it is necessary. As I think individual user development under zeppelin is the most common case. Although we may want to share across users, but I think it is very rare.  So I think by default everyone can has his own interpreter setting and interpreter can be instantiated with this setting.  If user want to share the interpreter across users, then admin can create another interpreter to make it shared across users.  Regarding the implementation, we can have one parent interpreter setting which is controlled by admin, and each user level setting can override the parent setting.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/244648764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/244649327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1381#issuecomment-244649327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1381","id":244649327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDY0OTMyNw==","user":{"login":"tae-jun","id":8201019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDEwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8201019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun","html_url":"https://github.com/tae-jun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tae-jun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T03:01:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T03:01:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok
