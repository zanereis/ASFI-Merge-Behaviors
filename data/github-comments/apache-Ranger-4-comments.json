In addition to the couple of review comments, can you please verify that the final packaging does not include codehaus jackson library? It seems Ranger admin continues to use codehaus jackson library to serialize REST API responses. For example, the response includes fields having null and empty value.\r\n\r\nThank you @mneethiraj for detailed review. You are right; codehaus.jackson was present in the admin library. I have checked the dependency tree and found that they were transitive. I have fixed the issue with this separate commit: https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/252/commits/7eb06a53a6ad1eff7e36f18a017020693aa4aaa0. If needed, we can squash it once the review is completed. I kept it separate so you can see the changes easily. The latest state is as follows:\r\n```\r\nranger@ranger:/opt/ranger/ranger-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-admin$ find . -name \"*jackson*\"\r\n./ews/lib/jackson-core-2.17.0.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-dataformat-smile-2.10.4.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-dataformat-cbor-2.10.4.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-databind-2.17.0.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-core-2.17.0.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-module-jaxb-annotations-2.17.0.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-dataformat-yaml-2.10.4.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/jackson-annotations-2.17.0.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ranger-plugins/knox/jackson-databind-2.17.0.jar\r\n./ews/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/ranger-plugins/knox/jackson-core-2.17.0.jar\r\nranger@ranger:/opt/ranger/ranger-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-admin$\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have one concern: when I deploy the project locally with Docker, I see the following issue on some endpoints after removing transitive dependencies:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ranger/assets/73108963/66250e91-81d5-4436-aad7-d5178b0f8358)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is a real issue because when I saw the issue previously, others did not see it with the same codebase. For example, when I mentioned the issue [here](https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/312#issuecomment-2093374126), in the next comment, the same codebase worked on another machine.

 - the error is likely due to missing Json provider in Ranger admin server. A provider should be implemented in Ranger servers like admin/KMS. In addition, Ranger client libraries should be updated to replace calls to ClientResponse.getEntity(cls) with JsonUtilsV2.jsonToObj(jsonStr, cls). I added these fixes on top of the changes in this PR, and created a .patch file that applies on the latest master branch. I will attach this file in RANGER-4225 shortly. Can you please review/verify these updates and create a new PR?
