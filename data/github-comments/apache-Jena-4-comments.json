I think it should check that it got into the index in the first place, otherwise it could be that text indexing is completely broken (no hits ever) and the test would still pass.\n\nWould it be possible/easy the structure the unit tests so that all regular tests get executed also with the uid field enabled? After all, it shouldn't affect the current functionality if you enable deletion support (if it does it's a bug, either in implementation or the tests). You could get a lot of free tests this way and there would perhaps be no need for further tests of uid/deletion functionality.\n\nA similar trick done with the graph-specific indexing, i.e. there are general tests in AbstractTestDatasetWithTextIndex, then a couple of extra tests for graph-aware functionality in AbstractTestDatasetWithGraphTextIndex, and finally TestDatasetWithLuceneGraphTextIndex pulls it together with the right (graph-aware) configuration. You could similarly try to reuse all the tests in AbstractTestDatasetWithTextIndex for the uid case.

The first is the dataset-with-operation-record that I did earlier, that provides a real abort function to any wrapped MRSW dataset. The second is the persistent-data-structure-based MR+SW dataset impl.

I can easily remedy the small leak and build two PRs.\n\nYou are right in that other than that, there aren't really natural boundaries inside each commit. That's a little unfortunate, because I know it will make review more of a pain in the neck, but at least I can promise that of the extant code into which this is being flung, nothing is touched outside of adding dependencies to POM files.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding the intent here?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149066287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149117326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-149117326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":149117326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTExNzMyNg==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-19T06:41:06Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T06:41:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does this code notice when the underlying data is modified?

Otherwise an external HTTP cache such as Varnish would work just as well if not better. See [this example](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos/wiki/FusekiTuning#http-caching) for how we use Varnish in front of Fuseki.

This localises changes to Fuseki only.\n\nSketch (there may be better ways to achieve the same effect).\n\n```\nclass OutputStream2 extends OutputStream\npublic OutputStream2(OutputStream out1, OutputStream out2)\npublic void write(byte b[]) throws IOException {\n        if ( out1 != null ) out1.write(b) ;\n        if ( out2 != null ) out2.write(b) ;\n    }\n    ...\n```\n\n`ResponseResultSet.OutputContent` can use `OutputStream` (it does not need `ServletOutputStream`).\n\n```\n    OutputStream outServlet = action.response.getOutputStream() ;\n    OutputStream out ;\n    if { writing to cache ) {\n        ByteArrayOutputStream outCatcher = new ByteArrayOutputStream() ;\n        out = new OutputStream2(outServlet, outCatcher) ;\n    } else {\n        out = outServlet ;\n    }\n    ...\n    proc.output(out) ;\n```\n\nThis will work if a new format is added (a Thrift based binary format for example) without needing the format to be aware of cache entry creation.\n\nIt also means the caching is not exposed in the ARQ API.\n\n#### Caching and content negotiation\n\nThe Cache key is insensitive to the \"Accept\" header.\n\nThe format of the output is determined by the \"Accept\" header.  The query string `output=` is merely a non-standard way to achieve the same thing when it is hard to set the HTTP header (some lightweight scripting libraries).\n\nThe current design writes the same format as the request, and uses the cache but these two operations are different:\n\n```\nGET /datasets/query=SELECT * { ?s ?p ?o}\nAccept: application/sparql-results+xml\n```\n\n```\nGET /datasets/query=SELECT * { ?s ?p ?o}\nAccept: application/sparql-results+json\n```\n\n#### Cache `ResultSet`\n\n(Discussion point) A possibility is that the cache is of a copy of the ResultSet (as java objects).\n\nAdvantages:\n- cached item is not in a particular format. Content negotiation happens per request.\n- OFFSET/LIMIT can be applied to the cached results f the original query is executed without OFFSET/LIMIT (weak version of paging). \n\nSee the experimental, sketch-only and out of date [sparql-cache](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jena/Experimental/sparql-cache/) for OFFSET/LIMIT processing.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Does not stream\n- cache entries are rewritten each time they are used. \n\nAn iterator over the result set that captures the output while iterating would address the non-streaming disadvantage.\n\nContent negotiation happens per request.\n\n#### Cache invalidation\n\nUpdate operations must invalid the cache. A simple way is to simply invalidate the whole cache.  It is very hard to determine whether an update affects a cache entry selectively.\n\n#### Configuration and Control\n\nThe cache is hard wired and always on.  It may not always be the right choice.  There needs to be a way to control it, possibly on a per-dataset basis.  Note there is only one SPARQL_Query instance per Fuseki server due to the way dispatch is dynamic.\n\nSuggestion 1: A servlet `SPARQL_Query_Cache` catches passes requests to a separate `SPARQL_Query`.  This is the inheritance way to separate cache code from the rest of processing.  It works better if OFFSET/LIMIT control is going to be added later.\n\nSuggestion 2: It is primarily `SPARQL_Query::sendResults` being caught here so a \"result handler\" set in `SPARQL_Query` would allow a separation of cache code into it's own class and just a hook in `SPARQL_Query`. This is the composition way to separate the cache code from the rest of processing.\n\n#### Reuse the Guava already in Jena\n\nExtend CacheGuava to have a constructor that takes a `org.apache.jena.ext.com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder`.\n\nBackground:\nJena includes a shared Guava 18 in `org.apache.jena.ext.com.google.common` in artifact `jena-shaded-guava`.  (Apparently Hadoop, the main reason we shade Guava does now in fact work with later Guava's than its dependency on an old Guava version.)\n\n#### Extend to CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE (future)\n\nIt is only for SELECT and ASK queries.  See `ResponseModel` and `ResponseDataset` for CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE.  The output capture point shoudl make this possible.\n\n#### Documentation and tests\n\nDocumentation and tests needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149183330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149196979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-149196979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":149196979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTE5Njk3OQ==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-19T12:10:48Z","updated_at":"2015-10-19T12:10:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Update operations must invalid the cache.

I really appreciate the review feedback and comments and it will help me to iterate and move ahead with the changes . I will start with implementation of **Capturing output** so that we can limit the changes to Fuseki module. \n\n**Caching and content negotiation**\n Will make changes to adhere to requested format based on Accept header.\n\n**Cache ResultSet** \n\nThe current implementation cache the resultSet java object for Describe and Construct query but cache the resultset data by iterating over the result set and capture output for Select and Ask queries. The challenge faced during caching resultSet objects alone for Select and Ask queries was in case of subsequent calls to iterate over results the resultSet object was closed and returned  error. \n\n**Cache invalidation**\n\nIn case of Cache invalidation do we plan to invalidate all the Cache Entry objects or only the impacted one. Invalidating all the Cache Entry objects will be easier but may have performance impact based on frequency of write operations but doing a selective CacheEntry invalidation is little tricky in terms of selecting the key. The current Key is based on the SPARQL_Query but in case of update the key has to be designed based on dataset and part of where clause. \n\n**Configuration and Control**\nYes, I am inclined for both the approach and approach 1 is much cleaner as with new changes Fuseki module can return the captured output and not directly write to ServletOutStream and flush results. \n\n**Reuse the Guava already in Jena** \n\nYes, will do\n\n**Extend to CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE (future)**\n\nThe current implementation cache the resultSet for CONSTRUCT and DESCRIBE queries but yes will extend to capture and cache results data for these queries as well.\n\n **Documentation and tests**\n\n+1 will definitely add\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149681690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149728229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-149728229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":149728229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTcyODIyOQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T23:14:42Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T23:14:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cache Invalidation: it is very hard to know what an update (adds and deletes) will change.

I'll take it point-by-point:\n- Performance Status: The suspicion to which I was referring is that it's because using the Streams API generates more objects and those objects have more state than using iterators. It should be noted that I have not been able to verify this. I could, by rewriting the PR to avoid the Streams API, but it would require a good bit of work to do that and I think it would be _much_ harder to read. I think the majority of the performance decline is because of the changes in design, not incidental stuff like this.\n- DatasetFactory: I just hadn't touched that yet to avoid touching anything outside of my code until we are happy with the basic machinery. I will happily put that in as per your proposal in that message. See a forthcoming commit. {grin}\n- Assembler: I'm still reading through the assembler subsystem and making sure I understand it before extending it. I should be able to supply something soon.\n- Documentation: Yes, I haven't done anything here. I assume you are talking about documentation in the website, right? Not Javadocs?\n- Persistent datastructures: Cool, I'll break these out and give them some tests.\n- Dependency management: Okay, I'll square that away. I didn't realize that $module/DEPENDENCIES even existed. What does that support?\n- (Not) Mocking in tests: I think that should be doable in most cases. I usually prefer mocking because it makes everything very explicit, but if Jena's habit is otherwise, I'm happy to follow it.\n- Warnings: Hm, didn't see those (except for the casts). I will make sure everything is clean. Those casts are really weird, because sometimes I have seen compilation fail without them, but they do seem to be unnecessary and the types are infer-able. I will check into it more thoroughly.\n- Journaling: I think including it could be a good way also to get some feedback. Is there some Jena-standard way to mark something as \"slightly experimental\" a la Google's `@Beta` annotation?\n- LockMRPlusSW: I will slap some tests on that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/149916761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/150008814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-150008814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":150008814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDAwODgxNA==","user":{"login":"samaitra","id":369459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/369459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra","html_url":"https://github.com/samaitra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-21T20:00:14Z","updated_at":"2015-10-21T20:00:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, thank you Andy\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/150008814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/151139579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/94#issuecomment-151139579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/94","id":151139579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTEzOTU3OQ==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-26T13:51:34Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T13:51:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@afs I can't find any of the unnecessary semicolon warnings-- can you give me a pointer?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/151139579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/151152208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/94#issuecomment-151152208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/94","id":151152208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTE1MjIwOA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-26T14:20:16Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T14:20:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On 26/10/15 13:51, A.
