If I remove the check for duplicate sorts, the rule was firing forever in the HepPlanner tests. In order to avoid that, you could put SortMergeRule in the same group.

I guess I prefer option 1), what's your take?\n2. testSortJoinTranspose3 is already a negative test. I will add another negative one with a sort on the inner input.\n3. For full join, I'm wondering about the implications of possibly having nulls in the sorting columns? Probably it is safe to push it for full join iff Sort consists of a \"naked\" limit?

I prefer (1) also but I wouldn't do it by making the rule look for particular types of RelNode. Nor do I want the rule to behave differently in different engines. It's a hard problem that we haven't solved yet but my suspicion is that metadata is the solution. If we can look at a RelNode - without knowing its type - and know that it will not produce more than 10 rows, then we know we don't need to apply limit(10). Similarly, metadata for uniqueness can prevent us from pushing aggregates too many times.\n\nSuppose you ran SortJoinTransposeRule and FilterSortTransposeRule in the same Hep program. It would repeatedly push a sort through the join, then through the underlying filter. Your strategy of looking for Sort on the inputs would fail, and the program would loop. Therefore I think we need a more robust way to find out whether a rule has been fired, and the answer is metadata - because metadata has a monotonicity property.\n\nThat said I think implementing a new kind of metadata is hard, and until https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-794 is fixed if we lean hard on metadata it will bite us.\n\nRe 2. I missed that case. I still think it's useful to add something to join.oq. Then we get to see whether these plans actually work.\n\nRe 3. I can see how full join would cause problems if you had 'order by deptno nulls first limit 3', and limiting the input would cause false-positive nulls to appear. I think the right answer is a comment that we haven't figured out full join yet.\n\nRe 4.

So, can you remove the `useFetch` and `useOffsetOnly` fields. I think it's sufficient to have a single method `supportsOffsetFetch()` which returns true by default (i.e. compliant with SQL 2008; see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-43). MySQL would override and return false, which means that it uses LIMIT syntax instead.\n\nI think you need to combine the `offset` and `fetch` methods into `offsetFetch(SqlNode offset, SqlNode fetch)` because you want to generate `OFFSET n ROWS FETCH NEXT n ROWS` for SQL-compliant databases and `LIMIT n OFFSET n` for the rest.
