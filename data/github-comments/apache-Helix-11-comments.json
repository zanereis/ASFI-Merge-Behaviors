When the IdealState is changed (which is necessary to scale a resource up or down), the Baseline is recalculated; due to the design of the algorithm, the new Baseline could be very different from the old Baseline depending on the order of resources. Therefore, the divergence is caused by the change of Baseline, while the Best Possible is respecting the old Baseline. \r\nAs a result, to combat divergence, the answer lies within the algorithm design; there is no clean-cut solution that \"eliminates divergence\". We cannot eliminate the difference between old Baseline and new Baseline because eliminating it is minimizing movement while sacrificing replica evenness - we need to achieve a balance between the two factors. I will continue to do research on this topic. \r\nIn terms of the scope of this issue, the tie-breaking code change will still go through to make scoring deterministic.

In terms of your last point, let me also add that I am not a big fan of the idea of creating a Builder just to make things backward-compatible because 1) it doesn't reduce duplicate code (in fact, it may end up adding more boilerplate code) 2) there is no clear common logic other than reading from System.Properties, and 3) I'd argue that sometimes a simple if-else does the trick and is the easiest to understand.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/601842437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/601939430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/851#issuecomment-601939430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/851","id":601939430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTkzOTQzMA==","user":{"login":"zhangmeng916","id":56051770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDUxNzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56051770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangmeng916","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-20T22:36:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T22:36:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One more thing, the added test cases are not enough.
