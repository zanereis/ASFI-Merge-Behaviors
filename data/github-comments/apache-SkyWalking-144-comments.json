Then delete the index outside this interval. Only the two parameters of downsampling (carried in the modle) and the defined data ttl time are needed here.\r\n2. Index positioning needs to calculate the interval within a user-defined time. The user-defined time will be converted into other forms in the query-graphql-plugin. I must unify the time form in order to use it in index positioning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/574965601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/574966988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4236#issuecomment-574966988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4236","id":574966988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDk2Njk4OA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T03:36:45Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T03:36:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I know the codes are different.
