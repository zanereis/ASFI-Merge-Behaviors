It looks like we might have fixed this in the Manager with:\r\n```\r\n    ThriftTransportPool.getInstance()\r\n        .setIdleTime(aconf.getTimeInMillis(Property.GENERAL_RPC_TIMEOUT));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, setIdleTime() is not called from anywhere else. So, after 3 seconds of being idle, the Thrift connection is removed from the ConnectionPool. When the client comes back around to trying to talk with the TabletServer, the Thrift connection has to be created again. Maybe it's different now, but back in 2013, increasing that timeout made a significant difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/919399303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/919423120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2255#issuecomment-919423120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2255","id":919423120,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM42zUiQ","user":{"login":"harjitdotsingh","id":75006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/harjitdotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harjitdotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T18:47:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T18:47:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We can Add it to the description.

The method was added to do the opposite (report long running scans) to help debug bigger problems with a cluster in commit 7f329a9c4dbf6f249a14a1f4bde43f261bf12875. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-2645. But the code to age off old scans isn't thread safe and I am not sure why you would just remove a scan only 5 minutes later after reporting it. If an admin doesn't see the scan in that window, its useless to put it on the monitor. If there are long running scans being returned than I think they should get displayed. It is disingenuous to report no scans running if there are.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/923297372/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/923402152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2277#issuecomment-923402152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2277","id":923402152,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM43Cf-o","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T22:34:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T22:34:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I included this change in #2278\r\n\r\nAfter #2278 is merged we can close this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/923402152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/923515614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1780#issuecomment-923515614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1780","id":923515614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM43C7re","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-21T01:57:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T01:57:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Since this change was not a complete fix, #2273 that takes us to 0.15.0 will need to be a blocker, or else we'll need to revert this.

It's not intended to manage all singletons, but rather to manage closable singleton lifecycles, and I would argue against reusing it for more singletons. It's primary use case is for implementing a singleton lifecycle for the closeable AccumuloClient, when legacy Instance/Connector APIs are used, so we can clean up the internal AccumuloClient when there are no more legacy Instance/Connector objects in use.

In fact, that was probably likely to create problems for us, with some operations blocking others, due to overuse of the off-the-shelf SimpleTimer class. I did notice this difference when I reviewed your original ThreadPools changes, but considered it an improvement, as it decoupled unnecessarily intertwined operations. I think going back to a single thread pool for these might actually be a regression. Do we really need a SimpleTimer-like object with a shared thread pool? I feel like it's going to bit us in future to have something off-the-shelf like that.

I don't think it's worth making something so feature heavy for the use cases SimpleTimer was written for. Changing the default size of the thread pool to a small number greater than 1 could help avoid blocking simple operations. However, it still has the same basic problem that it makes it easy for use to misuse it by not considering the impact of contention with other uses... but those problems might be less obvious and harder to detect if the contention is less consistent because we increased the size. It might be best to simply discourage the use of a \"simple\" timer with shared resources.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/926020254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/926034060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2286#issuecomment-926034060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2286","id":926034060,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM43MiiM","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-23T17:59:26Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T17:59:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not sure if this is still the case, but I noticed that in the past, we've used tables to store data that didn't need a table (e.g. where there was only a single row of information, and we just put it in a tabular format for lack of design creativity).

Less frequently I see the test pass and I also see it fail with the below error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.accumulo.core.client.AccumuloException: Table is being deleted\r\n```\r\n[Here](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Accumulo/job/main/org.apache.accumulo$accumulo-test/186/testReport/junit/org.apache.accumulo.test.functional/ConcurrentDeleteTableIT/testConcurrentFateOpsWithDelete/) is an example failure from a jenkins run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/929586266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/929595830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2197#issuecomment-929595830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2197","id":929595830,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM43aIG2","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T20:22:18Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T20:22:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@milleruntime I'd like to take another look at this soon, but it seems to be a little out of date right now.

Its needed to manage singletons in the implementation that were never moved into the client context. Once these singletons are moved into the client context we can remove the SingletonManager. Instance/Connector does not prevent this from movement from happening, its just that no one has ever done the work. If this work were done, I think it would be easy to refactor the Instance/Connector code to use a singleton client context object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/929606842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/929614358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2280#issuecomment-929614358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2280","id":929614358,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM43aMoW","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T20:49:33Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T20:49:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @keith-turner or @ctubbsii do you know if there a ticket for this work?\r\n\r\nThere is a general informal initiative spearheaded by some of us, reflected in our contributions, to try to remove our static resources in favor of managing resources with non-static objects with lifecycles. This was the basis of many decisions in 2.0, such as the creation of AccumuloClient, and before that, the creation of ClientContext and ServerContext. But, I do not think there is any specific tickets to complete the transition, for either the singletons managed by SingletonManager or for any other static resources elsewhere. It's mostly just a \"adopt this principle and fix as we go\" sort of thing, as far as I can tell.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/929614358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
