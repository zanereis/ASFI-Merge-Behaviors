At the beginning of the time you set, every 59 will cause the next execution to exceed 60. You can set it to execute every 2 minutes. Starting from 30 minutes, you probably know cron Logic\r\ncron的逻辑是如果超过60就会重置，下个周期从你设置的时间的开始，每隔59都会导致下次执行超过60，你可以设置每隔2分钟执行，从30分钟开始，你就大概知道cron的逻辑","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/698771031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
