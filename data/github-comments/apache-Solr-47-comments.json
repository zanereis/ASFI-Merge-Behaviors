I may have duplicated similar logic from other Solr Util classes, so happy to consolidate if you know of something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1725127507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1725620181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1925#issuecomment-1725620181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1925","id":1725620181,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5m2t_V","user":{"login":"joel-bernstein","id":5747955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDc5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5747955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-bernstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-19T13:49:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T13:49:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR is not building due to conflicts that occurred in CHANGES.txt.

Let me try to remember what I did back then and hopefully I'll have a fix to discuss here shortly.\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed now.  Test it out and lmk if you're still able to reproduce.  See [the fix](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1933/commits/030c5e0c795bb8e150bc7f40a08ba8138fd9f4c6) here.\r\n\r\nIn short, when serving APIs, Solr attempts to distinguish whether an incoming request is trying to trigger core-specific or cluster-wide functionality.  This has always been an easy question to answer for v1 APIs because of the relatively limited set of paths that those APIs use.  But for some v2 APIs we occasionally have to \"guess-and-check\": we fetch the SolrCore (incrementing its ref-count), we try to find the API in the list that the SolrCore knows about, and then if that doesn't work we look elsewhere.  In this case - where we fetched a SolrCore thinking the API might live there, only to be wrong- it turns out we weren't properly decrementing the ref-count for the SolrCore.\r\n\r\n> It turns out that if we put all of the JAX-RS annotations that describe the API on a Java interface that lives in a particular gradle module (instead of in the core module as we've done up to this point), then those annotations can be used to not just define the API, but also to drive client code generation! [...] There's a few [developer docs](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/dev-docs/apis.adoc#writing-jax-rs-apis) that describe how to create the interface with all our JAX-RS annotations [...] If you don't mind, I can make the necessary tweaks to this PR to get it to work with our code generation?\r\n\r\nI went ahead and made these changes.  With these changes, the build will now generate the following `SolrRequest` implementation \"for free\".  Very cool IMO\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static class UnloadCoreResponse extends JacksonParsingResponse<SolrJerseyResponse> {\r\n    public UnloadCoreResponse() {\r\n      super(SolrJerseyResponse.class);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static class UnloadCore extends SolrRequest<UnloadCoreResponse> {\r\n    private final UnloadCoreRequestBody requestBody;\r\n    private final String coreName;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Create a UnloadCore request object.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param coreName Path param -\r\n     */\r\n    public UnloadCore(String coreName) {\r\n      super(\r\n          SolrRequest.METHOD.valueOf(\"POST\"),\r\n          \"/cores/{coreName}/unload\".replace(\"{\" + \"coreName\" + \"}\", coreName));\r\n\r\n      this.coreName = coreName;\r\n      this.requestBody = new UnloadCoreRequestBody();\r\n      addHeader(\"Content-type\", \"application/json\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param deleteIndex If true, will remove the index when unloading the core.\r\n     */\r\n    public void setDeleteIndex(Boolean deleteIndex) {\r\n      this.requestBody.deleteIndex = deleteIndex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n     // <snip> remainder of definition removed for brevity\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo summarize this all - I think the only outstanding issue at this point is whether to change the RequestBody class over to use `Boolean` instead of `boolean`.  I can make that change if you don't object, or you're welcome to do it, or we can discuss more as well if you disagree.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1728321719/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1728535462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1930#issuecomment-1728535462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1930","id":1728535462,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nB1um","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-20T23:06:50Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T23:06:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Plan to merge this on Friday..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1728535462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1728536787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1905#issuecomment-1728536787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1905","id":1728536787,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nB2DT","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-20T23:08:40Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T23:08:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Planning to merge this on friday...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1728536787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1728541552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1943#issuecomment-1728541552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1943","id":1728541552,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nB3Nw","user":{"login":"stillalex","id":61026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex","html_url":"https://github.com/stillalex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-20T23:13:36Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T23:13:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> but ideally we would inject the propagating tracer and potentially this recording flag in an independent way that isn't specific to SolrCloud.

Anyway the upshot is that for export value retrieval there should be basically no cost to introducing this in the case of dense fields, and improvements (potentially significant) to introducing this for sparse fields.\r\n\r\nIn the SolrDocumentFetcher case there should be significant improvements for all cases.\r\n\r\nI plan to commit this early next week, pending feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1729974970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1729980401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1899#issuecomment-1729980401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1899","id":1729980401,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nHWfx","user":{"login":"magibney","id":6225104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjUxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6225104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney","html_url":"https://github.com/magibney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-21T17:09:33Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T17:09:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Proposed `CHANGES.txt` entry under `Improvements` for 9.4.0 release:\r\n```\r\n* SOLR-16966: Add a first-class cache for OrdinalMaps (Michael Gibney)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI plan to commit this early next week, pending feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1729980401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1730001505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1945#issuecomment-1730001505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1945","id":1730001505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nHbph","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-21T17:23:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T17:23:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another potential improvement is to use caffeinecache for collectionwatches due to performance being way better on compute -

I'll be honest, all the flavours of variables have been a bit confusing ;-)...   I think some accretion over time of concepts layered on concepts...\r\n\r\nSo one thing I'll ask, \"Is any of this required?\"...   I suspect that I don't quite understand how some folks use Solr...   I pretty much only ever run one Solr per VM/image with proxies in front etc, so in my world, Solr is always http, Solr is always localhost (127.0.01?), and Solr is always port 8983 when I am on that node.   I had actually been hoping to move in the direction of eliminating the whole port, schema, host variables, and just using a url everywhere....    I want to encourage us to be able to use the various commands like `bin/solr create` from anywhere, which would imply that you pretty much only ever do a `bin/solr [your_command] --solrUrl https://myserverincloud:50678 -u user:password` instead of the current way of looking up local variables.   This pattern may come from I generally stand up a solr as step one, and then externally, as step 2, interact with it.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this is all amazing work!   \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1732313901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1732324163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1935#issuecomment-1732324163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1935","id":1732324163,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5nQStD","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-23T13:55:42Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T13:55:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is very exciting.
