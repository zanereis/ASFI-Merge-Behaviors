 I have the same issue, #4551 and #4469 does not really address this question.\r\n\r\nI am not using GPU.\r\n\r\nIn the document it is also confusing:\r\n\r\n> Use the Prebuilt Binary Package\r\n> \r\n> For Linux users, MXNet provides prebuilt binary packages that support computers with either GPU or CPU processors. To download and build these packages using Maven, change the artifactId in the following Maven dependency to match your architecture:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> <dependency>\r\n>   <groupId>ml.dmlc.mxnet</groupId>\r\n>   <artifactId>mxnet-full_<system architecture></artifactId>\r\n>   <version>0.1.1</version>\r\n> </dependency>\r\n> ```\r\n> For example, to download and build the 64-bit CPU-only version for Linux, use:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> <dependency>\r\n>   <groupId>ml.dmlc.mxnet</groupId>\r\n>   <artifactId>mxnet-full_2.10-linux-x86_64-cpu</artifactId>\r\n>   <version>0.1.1</version>\r\n> </dependency>\r\n> ```\r\n> If your native environment differs slightly from the assembly package, for example, if you use the openblas package instead of the atlas package, it’s better to use the mxnet-core package and put the compiled Java native library in your load path:\r\n> ```\r\n> <dependency>\r\n>   <groupId>ml.dmlc.mxnet</groupId>\r\n>   <artifactId>mxnet-core_2.10</artifactId>\r\n>   <version>0.1.1</version>\r\n> </dependency>\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nwhich does not specifiy which POM the artifactID \"`mxnet-full_`\" is in.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how to fix.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281965044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281966785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5046#issuecomment-281966785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5046","id":281966785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTk2Njc4NQ==","user":{"login":"ilkarman","id":20063954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20063954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman","html_url":"https://github.com/ilkarman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilkarman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T11:23:26Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T11:23:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Fixed this by upgrading to latest version (0.9) - didn't need to remove the cudnn_tune also","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281966785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281983836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5099#issuecomment-281983836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5099","id":281983836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTk4MzgzNg==","user":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T12:51:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T12:51:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I adapted the code in the uncentered RMSProp pull request (#5116).

If you do not know what caused this error, you can try set environment variable MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE to NaiveEngine and run with debugger (i.e. gdb). This will force all operations to be synchronous and backtrace will give you the series of calls that lead to this error. Remember to set MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE back to empty after debugging.\r\n1\r\nC:\\Users\\anjos\\Downloads\\Image_Style\\Resourse>\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/282182869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/282183326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5123#issuecomment-282183326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5123","id":282183326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjE4MzMyNg==","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T02:10:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T02:10:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the message.

In the bucketing module, `curr_module` is passed in as the `shared_module`, but instead the module with default_bucket_key should be passed. [Link](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/blob/memory/python/mxnet/module/bucketing_module.py#L214).  \r\n2.  When the memory pool of the default bucket module doesn't hold sufficient memory for other bucket to bind, extra NDArrays are allocated. But these NDArrays are not added back to the pool.  [Link](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/blob/memory/src/executor/graph_executor.cc#L517)\r\n3.  In the `PlanMemory` pass in nnvm, the memory allocator is not aware of the allocated memory pool of the shared module. [Link](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/nnvm/blob/memory/src/pass/plan_memory.cc#L108)\r\n4. The `NNVM_EXEC_MATCH_RANGE` variable has impact on the result of memory planning. Instead of letting the user to choose it, the backend could just try different values and choose the best one to automate the process. Some users are not even aware of this variable.
