revised code/implementation is much cleaner and clearer - nicely done. I pushed a few more updates to the branch as I reviewed the code. I polished some of the tests to remove unnecessary cruft and suggest doing the remaining tests in a similar way.\n\nOne last outstanding item is making sure old style sequence execs are still executable (a test is missing for this case) - @ioana-blue is aware and will amend the pr.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253830849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253834983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1382#issuecomment-253834983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1382","id":253834983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzgzNDk4Mw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T15:30:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T15:30:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Deferring to @mdeuser.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253834983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/253837037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1312#issuecomment-253837037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1312","id":253837037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzgzNzAzNw==","user":{"login":"ddragosd","id":541933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTkzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/541933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd","html_url":"https://github.com/ddragosd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddragosd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T15:37:59Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T15:37:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Given that docker-compose is OS independent I've automated it with Travis to make it easy to maintain. \n\nComparing to a previous build this one adds about 94 seconds out of which 30 are used currently to wait for the invoker to set up a Kafka topic. \n\nThe build reuses the docker containers built by the existing Travis build and that's why it's pretty fast, but it could also be invoked independently, in which case it builds the containers. When executed independently the total time is approx 15 minutes ( b/c it only builds distDocker )\n\nWe could think of invoking it separately maybe by using OpenWhisk itself and write a simple function to be executed on every Git commit :). I don't know otherwise if we could invoke multiple Travis builds on each commit. Another idea is that Travis builds the containers and uploads them to a place like Docker Hub from which another build pulls the latest versions of the containers and runs some tests - this would work well for a performance tests suite.\n\nFor the moment I tried doing the simplest thing that
