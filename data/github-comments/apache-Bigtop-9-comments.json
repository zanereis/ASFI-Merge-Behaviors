I prefer to have ruby from distro or rvm.\r\n\r\n@oflebbe really thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nWe do need the ruby-related facilities such as ruby rumtime, rake, gem and bundle to build logstash. \r\nAnd for the Arm64 dependency issues, the ruby-2.4 is the latest version that works with logstash. \r\nBut ruby version is 2.0 in Centos 7 and 2.3 in ubuntu16.04.\r\n\r\nWhen leveraging rvm to install ruby, rvm would pull the ruby binaries and spend less time than  compiling ruby directly on x86_64.\r\nBut on Arm64, no ruby binaries are available and rvm would also download source code and compile ruby.\r\n\r\nIMHO, our Bigtop should support different kind of distros and platforms(x86_64/arm64).\r\nIf ruby-2.4 were downloaded and compiled directly , it could guarantee that ruby-related facilities would be properly installed on the various distros and platforms though it may cost extra time just on x86 when building bigtop_toolchain. WDYT? \r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/620464186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/621567964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/635#issuecomment-621567964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/635","id":621567964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMTU2Nzk2NA==","user":{"login":"JunHe77","id":17865359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY1MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17865359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77","html_url":"https://github.com/JunHe77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunHe77/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T02:02:37Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T02:02:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Verified with ubuntu-18.04 on both arm and x86.

But It's my definite understanding that Mpacks are supposed to be deployable without deploying a new version of Ambari.  (which your current proposal kind of goes against.) So they should be in fact separate entities that exist outside an ambari install.  Perhaps you don't need to push this upstream but instead add a new structure to this project and host all the code changes here as a management pack?  (They're just supposed to be tarballs that you can throw into other ambari's, not tied to a release.)\r\n\r\nI know there are other management packs included with Ambari already so their is totally a precedent set in terms of what other have done.  I still believe it goes against the spirit of the whole thing.  If they are to be shipped with ambari then it's supposed to be a stack and not a management pack.  (I have to say I prefer Mpacks as at this time it seems they're cleaner/self contained.  So if that's why you did it I get it, still feel like it should be a releasable artifact.)\r\n\r\nI mean all this to say \"this looks amazing\"  I want it.  Can I have it without having to download a patched Ambari?  (I totally will if it comes to that.  Just again kind of feels against the intent of what a mpack is.)  I mean I guess I can fork the code and host it separately but I'd rather keep things together.\r\n\r\nAlso I totally want to see more services included and I\"m totally willing to help.

You could then do a rip and replace of specific services.  Like if you wanted to use the release from bigtop that has \"fresher\" apache builds than say HDP or CDH.  (Yes, we want to make sure we don't miss dependencies, but I'm saying there would likely be some people that would appreciate the choice.)  \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like that the fresh install from BigTop Ambari could finally deploy something that isn't HDP.
