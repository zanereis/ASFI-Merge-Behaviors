Is is related to the decorrelation problem, or could they be part of a separate issue?\r\n\r\n1. Changes to Prepare.java file, \r\nYes in a subtle way. The trimUnusedField ,in the prepareSql function call path, is called conditionally based on the configHolder's isTrimUnusedFields flag and due to this it results in trimUnusedFields getting called before decorrelateQuery is called. However, the same functionality in PlannerImpl.rel code path (most calcite users seem to use it), trimUnusedFields is set to false and this makes sure the decorrelateQuery is called before the trimUnusedFields.\r\n\r\nIn both the cases the RelFieldTrimmer program is called in the optimize phase of the query, so essentially fields will get trimmed, but in the case of Prepare (which I believe is less used by users) doing so will result in a tree which will cause other issues due to lack of comprehensive handling of correlate subqueries.\r\n\r\nEssentially I am trying to make both the paths to behave same.\r\n\r\n2. The changes in CassandraSchema.java are done because earlier CassandraSchema Test code loaded the materializations using TRIMMED Hook. As this code path is no more available, I changed it to load on CONVERTED Hook. This way the materializations are available for the optimizations, otherwise the materializations are not loaded and MaterializedView optimization is skipped. \r\n\r\nHope the above description made it clear. Please let me know if you have any further questions/suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1932905283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1933283166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3641#issuecomment-1933283166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3641","id":1933283166,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5zO49e","user":{"login":"JiajunBernoulli","id":45968640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTY4NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45968640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli","html_url":"https://github.com/JiajunBernoulli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiajunBernoulli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-08T02:52:06Z","updated_at":"2024-02-08T02:52:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Another question I have is whether this should be as you wrote it in RelBuilder, or it should be a rewrite rule in the optimizer.

If we call directly `rel.estimateRowCount(mq)`, this flexibility is lost. In fact, this PR is just applying our own Calcite rules, see `RelNode#estimateRowCount` javadoc:\r\n```\r\nDon't call this method directly. Instead, use\r\n{@link RelMetadataQuery#getRowCount}, which gives plugins a chance to\r\noverride the rel's default ideas about row count.\r\n```\r\nSo all these calls to `rel.estimateRowCount(mq)` should have been `mq.getRowCount(rel)` from the beginning (and we are likely dealing with a copy-paste of sub-optimal code propagated). As I said before, at that time this might have been difficult to catch, because by default the effect is the same.\r\n\r\n@tanclary @JiajunBernoulli  Writing tests for these changes is possible, but cumbersome. See e.g. the recent commit https://github.com/apache/calcite/commit/f7069cc5245c22f816c565669f52b4f30b046f4d  which performed a similar change in one location, and how \"artificial\" it was to show the impact on a unit test.\r\nPersonally, I understand the logic behind this change, and bearing in mind that is not straightforward to provide tests for this, I'd consider exceptionally merging the PR without tests. But if others consider that this is not acceptable, I'll accept that decision.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1933577073/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1933653216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3676#issuecomment-1933653216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3676","id":1933653216,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5zQTTg","user":{"login":"TheOezzi","id":10713047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzEzMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10713047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi","html_url":"https://github.com/TheOezzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheOezzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-08T09:17:32Z","updated_at":"2024-02-08T09:17:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey !

(so either we trim after decorrelate, or we don't trim at all, depending on the configHolder)\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     if (this.context.config().forceDecorrelate()) {\r\n>       // Sub-query decorrelation.\r\n>       root = root.withRel(decorrelate(sqlToRelConverter, sqlQuery, root.rel));\r\n>     }\r\n> \r\n>     if (configHolder.get().isTrimUnusedFields()) {\r\n>       // Trim unused fields.\r\n>       root = trimUnusedFields(root);\r\n> \r\n>       Hook.TRIMMED.run(root.rel);\r\n>     }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nYeah, your observation is right, and there's a subtle issue that requires attention in this case. \r\n\r\nBefore the decorrelate function is invoked, the plan (for the added test in the PR) appears as follows:\r\n```\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], INVAMOUNT=[SUM($0)], INVCOUNT=[COUNT()])\r\n  LogicalProject($f0=[*($2, $SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MAX($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject($f0=[+($0, $1)])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(IS NOT NULL($2), IS NOT NULL($3), =($4, $cor0.C5633_503), =($5, $SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MAX($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject(C5633_2186=[$5])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($4, $cor1.C5633_2187), =($2, $cor1.C5633_2184), =($3, $cor1.C5633_2185), <=($5, $cor0.C5633_485))])\r\n      JdbcTableScan(table=[[BASEJDBC, T1704]])\r\n})))], variablesSet=[[$cor1]])\r\n      JdbcTableScan(table=[[BASEJDBC, T1704]])\r\n}))])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(<($2, 10), >($2, 0))])\r\n      JdbcTableScan(table=[[BASEJDBC, INVOICE]])\r\n ```\r\n \r\nThe decorrelate function before the trimFields operation is essentially a no-op. This is because decorrelation only occurs when a Correlate node is created, which is determined by a triggering check.\r\n \r\n ```\r\n     if (!corelMap.hasCorrelation()) {\r\n      return rootRel;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe hasCorrelation function returns true only if mapCorToCorRel is nonEmpty. However, in this scenario, mapCorToCorRel is empty because no Correlate node exists. Therefore, the decorrelate function essentially does nothing.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the trimUnusedFields operation is executed on the tree, it prunes certain fields that are essential for correlated variables. Consequently, a new node, LogicalProject(C5633_505=[$2]), is introduced.\r\n\r\n```\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], INVAMOUNT=[SUM($0)], INVCOUNT=[COUNT()])\r\n  LogicalProject($f0=[*($0, $SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MAX($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject($f0=[+($0, $1)])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(IS NOT NULL($2), IS NOT NULL($3), =($4, $cor0.C5633_503), =($5, $SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MAX($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject(C5633_2186=[$5])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($4, $cor1.C5633_2187), =($2, $cor1.C5633_2184), =($3, $cor1.C5633_2185), <=($5, $cor0.C5633_485))])\r\n      JdbcTableScan(table=[[BASEJDBC, T1704]])\r\n})))], variablesSet=[[$cor1]])\r\n      JdbcTableScan(table=[[BASEJDBC, T1704]])\r\n}))])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($0, Sarg[(0..10)])])\r\n      LogicalProject(C5633_505=[$2]). --- a new node introduced by trimUnusedFields\r\n        JdbcTableScan(table=[[BASEJDBC, INVOICE]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe subsequent optimization of this tree leads to an exception because the tree is no longer correct.\r\n\r\nThis issue is specific to the prepareSql path and is not observed during the plannerImpl rel path. [link](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/prepare/PlannerImpl.java#L265).\r\n\r\nTwo potential solutions have been identified:\r\n\r\n1. Fix the RelTrimmer to avoid generating the problematic node.\r\n2. Ensure consistency between both code paths by refraining from calling the RelTrimmer in the prepareSql path.\r\n\r\nI chose the second option, as it seems logical to call the RelTrimmer only after the SubQueryRemovalRule has been applied and also it makes the Prepare code path in sync with PlannerImpl path which I guess is used by many calcite implementations by users.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if it is clear and thank you for reviewing the changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1935259456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1935260458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3678#issuecomment-1935260458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3678","id":1935260458,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5zWbsq","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-09T02:51:59Z","updated_at":"2024-02-09T02:51:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

Plus, before removing this [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chesterton%27s_fence), we would need to understand the reasons why field trimming was included in there in the first place. Also, removing the trimming can have undesired consequences (e.g. some projects might have fields which are expensive to retrieve/compute, so they should only be part of the final plan if they are really used, otherwise they should be trimmed; so this change would lead to a performance regression).\r\n\r\nI think fix 1 is the right way to go (although I understand it will be harder). Field trimming is quite a powerful tool (not without some bugs), which can be used by downstream projects (either via SqlToRelConverter#trimUnusedFields or directly via RelFieldTrimmer, since both are public); so if we find a bug on it, I think it would be better to try to fix it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1935544748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1936411407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3681#issuecomment-1936411407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3681","id":1936411407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5za0sP","user":{"login":"mihaibudiu","id":19397042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzk3MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19397042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu","html_url":"https://github.com/mihaibudiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-09T18:28:26Z","updated_at":"2024-02-09T18:28:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Maybe we need validate foo table and foo function(Discussion in JIRA).\r\n\r\nI don't think that makes sense. The identifier scopes for tables and functions are still disjoint, so the existing validation logic in `SqlValidatorImpl` still applies. The updated grammar produces the same SQL AST as `TABLE(foo())`. This is why there are no changes outside the grammar and its test.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is upgraded to being able to handle ambiguous identifiers - e.g. supporting nullary table functions - then things get much harder, both for design and implementation. As I mentioned on the JIRA ticket I think that's a dubious cost/benefit tradeoff.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1954181797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1954267702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3693#issuecomment-1954267702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3693","id":1954267702,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM50e8I2","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-20T13:56:05Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T13:56:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
