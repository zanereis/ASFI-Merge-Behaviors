From SkyWalking perspective, we should expose some APIs to set URL whitelist which could not be traced(no header injection, and only span sending out or not). WDYT?\r\n\r\nYou are both correct, Google doesn't allow the modification of the headers for security and I have since found out that the skywalking-client-js adds a sw8 header to the outbound requests with a trace ID and segment ID adding this to the register call worked :) `noTraceOrigins: [/.*googleapis.*/, /.*firebaseapp.*/],` Thankyou. \r\n\r\n@wu-sheng May I change this from a [BUG] to a [FEATURE] request please as my problems seem to be more me not understanding some of the properties in the register function and not knowing I needed to call that. \r\n\r\n@Fine0830 I am not sure if this is possible but somewhere in the xhr.ts read event.details.requestHeaders(\"X-Content-Type-Options\") and if it matches \"nosniff\" then don't modify the header and do the same as you do with `noTraceOrigins` ? I am happy to run a test version for you if that would help. \r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options\r\n\r\nThanks Again guys I really appreciate the helps.

me describe the problem I encountered and how to solve it.\r\n\r\nMy OAP server was  down from April 25 to today, I got `table: endpoint_traffic does not exist. OAP is running in 'no-init' mode, waiting... retry 3s later` when I tried to start OAP server. Then I try to rerun init-mode job and got the same log `table: endpoint_traffic does not exist`, but the es index didn't created.\r\nI compared the following two pieces of code in class StorageEsInstaller,\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    protected boolean isExists(Model model) {\r\n        ElasticSearchClient esClient = (ElasticSearchClient) client;\r\n        String tableName =

esClient.isExistsIndex(TimeSeriesUtils.latestWriteIndexName(model));\r\n\r\n        if ((templateExists && !template.isPresent()) || (!templateExists && template.isPresent())) {\r\n            throw

execute on model not exist shows that `template` and `lastIndex` are created only if `template` not exists, these two judgments do not match and lastIndex will not be created.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void createTimeSeriesTable(Model model) throws StorageException {\r\n        ElasticSearchClient esClient = (ElasticSearchClient) client;\r\n        String tableName
