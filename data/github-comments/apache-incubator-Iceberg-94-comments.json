I can create a copy of the diagram and try it out. \r\n\r\non #3, I think a diagram like this can be helpful in two related but different situations - an introductory overview for new folks that gives a high-level understanding of the layout and types of files, and a deeper view of how the layout and underlying structure changes as the dataset changes. \r\n\r\nto me, having the point-in-time diagram works really well for the spot it's currently in the docs, since it's a good introduction for new users on that page. then there could be another section covering the changes-over-time content for users who want that more detailed view into how it changes as table changes are made\r\n\r\nI actually did a presentation internally where a subset has that structure (\"layout overview and file types, then how it changes over time\") and it worked well. I'm also doing it publicly via webinar on thursday and making a written version of it shortly thereafter, so that could help here too. the changes-over-time view in that content currently shows the files and their location in the filesystem with color-coding of file types, but I think this diagram view like you have here is a better way to tell that story (or maybe both). I can try to address point #3 with multiple versions of this new merged diagram in that content and share here to see if it works well.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?

(unless the KMS has a batch DEK generation API, which is not very common as far as I know)\r\n2. if it is a double wrap system, then the first call gets a master encryption key (MEK) to generate a KEK, and all DEKs are generated locally based on that cached KEK. So we always have 1 KMS call for N files.\r\n\r\nSo the number of calls to KMS really depends on the algorithm, not that much on the encryption manager API, unless the KMS allows batch operation or it is a completely different encryption scheme. And the KMS would be embedded in the encryption manager implementation and perform necessary caching of keys behind the scene.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I completely agree that we should use batch operation whenever possible, I will try to find a best way to update the manifest read and write path to be able to leverage batch operations. I will provide an updated PR tonight, meanwhile please let me know what you think about the comment above.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/848118807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/848238709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2606#issuecomment-848238709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2606","id":848238709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0ODIzODcwOQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-25T20:30:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T20:30:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @karuppayya!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/848238709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/848311406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2520#issuecomment-848311406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2520","id":848311406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0ODMxMTQwNg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-25T22:30:03Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T22:30:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The situation where we want to use the bulk API is whenever we are going to make a call to the KMS per file.

The keys (DEKs) are either generated randomly by Iceberg, or fetched from a KMS. The key wrapping is always done via KMS calls. Key_metadata doesn't store the keys themselves, since this would make them exposed in manifest files. Therefore, passing `key_metadata` to the data file writers doesn't help, because these writers need the data encryption keys. Calling KMS to unwrap them doesn't make sense in this particular point... Therefore, we need a separate mechanism to deliver the DEK(s) and other parameters to the writers.

Who do you think would be appropriate to review this? The tests all passed though.\r\n\r\n@jshmchenxi  - I mostly meant that it should be considered by some of the people who work closest with parquet (and also it should be ensured that it works with the more recent Spark 2.4.x and Spark 3.x versions we support).\r\n\r\nFortunately, @\\ggershinsky is a very active Parquet committer (or possibly PMC now?) and has been doing some of the very hard work in parquet column level encryption, so if Gideon says we need this, then that's likely enough people to speak to. @\\Fokko is also a parquet commiter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, one of the PMCs / Vice President of this project, @rdblue is also a parquet PMC (in addition to a PMC or committer on what feels like every project and ), so we're in good hands in my book @jshmchenxi 👍. But thank you for considering my input. Just trying to make sure things stay sane, since it seems that some of the changes you've been putting up might not have been discussed on the dev mailing list (though I could totally have missed it). So I'm just ensuring that the right folks see potentially large changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/850117839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/850230256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2588#issuecomment-850230256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2588","id":850230256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDIzMDI1Ng==","user":{"login":"snazy","id":957468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/957468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy","html_url":"https://github.com/snazy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snazy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-28T08:00:19Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T08:00:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @snazy looks like the build failed for java8.

It's not that the Nessie Client in Iceberg is broken, it's \"just\" the server that cannot run.

I can see your point with respect to the secrets in the public config. That does seem like a headache.\r\n\r\nI also don't necessarily have an idea for a \"great\" universal solution.\r\n\r\nAs we have users who do need this, I think I'm going to give it an initial attempt using the idea that @RussellSpitzer and I had (for just the Spark catalogue at least), to at least see what the pain points are in general and then maybe something better will come to me / us

Yes, that's indeed a bug ( #2308) that we will need to fixed. \r\n\r\nIf you don't do any compaction, then we will need to consider other reasons, such as  people may replay the duplicated change log events from mysql binlog to apache iceberg.  For example,  at timestamp t1, people scanned all the existing rows from mysql table and migrate them into apache iceberg by flink streaming job,   then they start to migrate the incremental binlog events since the timestamp t1.  If we don't record the binlog offset at timestamp t1 in a MySQL transaction, then we may choose to replay a bit more binlog events (which means exporting the binglog events before timestamp t1), in this case we may also encounter the duplicated rows in apache iceberg table.  Because currently the apache iceberg table are maintaining the CDC events just as it happened,  I mean if INSERT the same row twice, then  the iceberg table will produce two duplicated rows rather than one row.   This will be resolved if we provide an option at the flink streaming sink job side to indicate that we will transfer all the insert rows as UPSERT(s). Pls see this [PR](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1996).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/851952014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/851958766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2647#issuecomment-851958766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2647","id":851958766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MTk1ODc2Ng==","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-01T09:01:19Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T09:01:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the  root cause is :  we did not use the correct version for apache iceberg,  apache flink, apache hive.

Would be happy to hear out https://github.com/viirya's thoughts as well. Am unable to tag https://github.com/viirya. Please see if you can...\r\n\r\nThe PR description about GDPR - is to decide between \r\na) whether to ignore deletes by `default` or \r\nb) whether to take a special flag to be able to ignore deletes. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning is that - \r\n* In Spark Structured streaming - we are STREAMING Iceberg table - row by row. ==> So, there is NO way to STREAM deletes from Iceberg table. \r\n* Which implies ==> when we encounter deletes - we are left with 2 choices\r\n    1. fail - with `UnsupportedSnapshotDataOperation - DELETE`\r\n    2. Ignore deletes and move on. \r\n* almost all of the users of the Iceberg tables want to be GDPR compliant.\r\n* which implies ==> they would want to delete some rows out of their Iceberg table & want to stream reads out of that table.\r\n* So, if we throw - UnsupportedOperation - when we encountered a Snapshot of type Delete while reading off of Iceberg Table -  potentially all tables out there will need to handle this!\r\n* So, my proposal is to accept that - Iceberg tables will have GDPR deletes - i.e., - if the Iceberg table has Snapshots which are marked as Delete - we will ignore that Snapshot for streaming read purposes. In the later PRs I will expose a Spark Option - which will give the ability to fail the streaming read - if a Delete is encountered. \r\n\r\nDid this make sense!?

This does make the naming a bit awkward as @flyrain suggested, but I think this is the same strategy taken by the data file write path, where we can notice that the `FileAppenderFactory` also have those methods containing `EncryptedOutputFile` for exactly the same purpose.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion on this. The logic looks good to me. But the more descriptive name provides benefits:\r\n1. Doesn't confuse code reader, reader won't confuse a plain text file with an encrypted file.\r\n2. Better naming usually means better abstraction, and more future-proof.
