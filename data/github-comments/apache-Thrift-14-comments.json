Frameworks influence app startup time and Cocoapods/Carthage already provide this functionality with podspecs (we use Cocoapods atm). \n  A bigger issue we've run into when updating (since we generate code for 6+ client langs) is that we have property naming collisions .e.g. .code in subtypes of NSError had to be renamed to errorCode, or .description. Being able to have some way of dealing with that would be nice. One possible solution might be a language-specific alias e.g. generate 'errorCode' for Swift, but leave it as 'code' for other langs. That would avoid having to uglify all client code with manually prefixed names. It's a different issue I know but it's also name-collision related, and has cost me some considerable effort.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/226934394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/226937278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1030#issuecomment-226937278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1030","id":226937278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjkzNzI3OA==","user":{"login":"matyapiro31","id":4539888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mzk4ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4539888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31","html_url":"https://github.com/matyapiro31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matyapiro31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-18T11:45:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T11:45:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nsuke , what makes it be failed?\nI could not find its cause.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/226937278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/226982822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1002#issuecomment-226982822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1002","id":226982822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjk4MjgyMg==","user":{"login":"apocolipse","id":260871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse","html_url":"https://github.com/apocolipse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-19T06:57:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-19T06:57:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So for Cocoapods/Carthage, you're also using Frameworks (startup time is negligible).

I still have a few complaints.\n1. The document repeats a lot of stuff that can be found elsewhere, e.g. in the Thrift Whitepaper. There is nothing per se wrong with repeating stuff, but from my feeling it makes the spec a bit bloaty as it is now. We need to find the right balance here. \n2. I think the structure should be revised grossly. No need to panic, I'm going to explain what I have in mind. By looking at the bits and bytes the reader may miss an important point: The order of data is always the same and entitrely Independent from the wire format, because that's the way Thrift Protocols work. \n   - At the first level we have messages. They have a certain structure.\n   - at the next level, a particular data item has a certain structure: a  map always consists of two types and a count, plus the elements. That does not change between protocols. What changes is the way how a particular protocol organizes the data onto the wire.\n   - and one level deeper we are at what I mean by revising the structure: I would not constantly jump back and forth between protocols to explain structs, lists, sets, integers, etc. Instead, there should be one chapter focusing on binary, and another one for compact. That makes it much easier \n     a) for the reader who is usually interested in only one protocol at a time, and \n     b) for future maintainers to add more protocols, such as JSON.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/229774327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/229881069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1036#issuecomment-229881069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1036","id":229881069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTg4MTA2OQ==","user":{"login":"erikvanoosten","id":630600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten","html_url":"https://github.com/erikvanoosten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T07:53:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T07:53:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @Jens-G .
