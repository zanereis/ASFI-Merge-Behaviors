The process of enabling and disabling Controller Services is complex. Currently, the NiFi UI supports enabling and disabling a single Controller Service. When enabling the user has the option to conditionally enable any dependent Controller Services and starting any referencing Processors/Reporting Tasks. When disabling the user does not have this option as the user must stop all referencing Processors/Reporting Tasks and disable any dependent Controller Services. Since there could be any number of affected components, this helps keep the operation as concise as possible, helps guarantee its success, and provides the user the necessary insight into the operation.\r\n\r\nThe API that your invoking is actually part of a larger sequence [1] to update Variables and Parameters that could be referenced by Controller Services and their referencing components across all Nodes in a cluster. The UX for those actions show the user the affected components and provides updates as the cluster performs the sequence of operations. I think this feature would also benefit from a similar UX where the user can see the full scope of their action and gets updates while the action completes.\r\n\r\n[1]

Here's my 2 cents:\r\n- I'm not the one to review the code because my JavaScript skills are non-existent, so I can't review from that perspective.\r\n- The calls that the UI makes are to the existing endpoints, which asynchronously enable/disable controller services. So I don't think we have concerns about high load causing timeouts, failures, etc. because it shouldn't block\r\n- I do agree with mcgilman that I'd like to see a UI that allows the controller services to be visualized with all referencing components so that users know exactly what they are doing when they Disable All. And when enabling, ideally it would be helpful to be able to choose to start referencing components as well.\r\n- That said, I think this feature is extremely useful as-is. The more powerful UI capability can still be provided in a future release of NiFi, but I think this is significantly more helpful than what we have currently.\r\n\r\nSo while I'm not in a position to review the code I'm a +1 personally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1041928487/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1041971783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5774#issuecomment-1041971783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5774","id":1041971783,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4-GzpH","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-16T18:17:27Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T18:17:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lawye1973 this PR is also set to merge into the `master` branch.

I debugged the unit test and `normalizeKeyColumnNamesAndCheckForValues` doesn't quote the column names, just normalizes it by uppercasing it and removing underscores and such. Also the normalized column name it matches against isn't quoted, it should only be quoted when generating the SQL. However it was using `normalizedColumnName` as the column name in the `WHERE` clause when it should be using `desc.getColumnName()` like the `SET` clause does. That can cause issues, I will issue another commit to update the unit test to illustrate this, along with the fix to get the test to pass :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1042106843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1042227220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5776#issuecomment-1042227220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5776","id":1042227220,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4-HyAU","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-16T20:30:22Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T20:30:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks @markap14, LGTM 👍\r\n> \r\n> Will wait for the final check to finish (restarted dur to a timeout, which I doubt was to do with these changes but worth making sure it all passes), then will look to merge if all clear\r\n\r\nActually, looks like that Check has been timing out for most PRs recently, so appears to be an unrelated issue and not one to block merging this change","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1042227220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1042236034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5771#issuecomment-1042236034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5771","id":1042236034,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4-H0KC","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-16T20:32:11Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T20:32:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the improvement!

I tested it out, and I can verify that CRON driven did in fact remain in a bad state originally and after this PR it does not, so that part works well.\r\n\r\nI also tested it with event-driven, though, and it did not work. I created a flow: GenerateFlowFile (CRON driven) -> UpdateAttribute (EventDriven) -> UpdateAttribute.\r\nRun Once on GenerateFlowFile produced the desired FlowFile. Run Once on the event-driven UpdateAttribute did NOT process the FlowFile. It just left it in the queue. It also left the processor in a state of \"RUN_ONCE\" which means that I could not start it, edit it, delete it, or run it again.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, my recommendation would be to revert the changes to the EventDrivenSchedulingStrategy completely and leave it as an unsupported operation. Event Driven was an experiment that we tried, in order to reduce CPU utilization that we had with Timer-Driven processors and provide potentially even better latency. However, once we introduced the \"Bored Yield Duration\" to timer-driven processors, we no longer had an issue with high CPU utilization, and the expense of event-driven ended up being more expensive than Timer-Driven. We've since found a few issues with Event-Driven scheduling strategy that have not been addressed, simply because we marked the feature as Experimental and we expect to remove it entirely (or otherwise completely rewrite it) in the next major version (2.0). Because of this, nobody should ever use the Event-Driven scheduling strategy, right now, and that's why we didn't implement the Run Once capability there to begin with.
