When ergonomics is enabling the Java support, then without any further tweaks, after it is enabled, a dialog (on JDK 8) or a \"status bar tooltip\" would come up suggesting installing nb-javac, which would then require a restart. That feels like a poor user experience. If, while the Java support is being enabled, we can ask the user if he/she wants to install nb-javac, and avoid the restart and further inconvenience, that'd significantly improve the user experience IMO.\r\n\r\nRegarding using ecj, even though I wouldn't prevent anyone from looking into that, I personally think it would be an enormous effort, the benefits would be limited, and it may not be a good strategic choice.

that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/414045483/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/414045777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/715#issuecomment-414045777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/715","id":414045777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDA0NTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-18T09:44:38Z","updated_at":"2018-08-18T09:44:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm

I would not hold back newer JDK's due to older. 11 comes out [next month](http://www.java-countdown.xyz/). IMHO its more important to support newer than older. Is Netbeans forward looking or more concerned with legacy compatibility? It is clear Oracle wants to move Java forward faster. I would hope Netbeans is not a IDE holding onto the past.\r\n\r\nFYI I also have some 70+ Eclipse packages, maybe close to 100. No where near the amount for Netbeans. At the same time. I have no Java 11 fixes for Eclipse, like I have for Netbeans. Just some food for thought. Its all moot to me, as my packages are pretty different from upstream. But I do not believe I can run NB on JDK 11 presently. Definitely cannot builder under JDK 11. I am running RC1 on 10, it fails on 11. My from source version is still a work in progress. Have some odd issues there I need to resolve.\r\n\r\nIMHO if people need to support older JDK's they can use older IDE's, like NB 8.x. Older stuff should not hold back newer. Not when newer is about to be the current release version.

They just waited till 11 to force it on others. This change does work for JDK 10, the current JDK. Just not Java 8.\r\n\r\nLikely have to switch sources or some other means to support 8 and 11+. It is a lot of work to support both via some means. Or cut one off, saying NB needs JDK 10+ to build vs 8. Which would make it more forward looking. Without such changes, next month when JDK 11 is released. The latest Netbeans will not be able to build using the latest/current JDK. We will be right back here again, then instead of now. I do not understand the requirement for the latest Netbeans to be able to build or run under older JDKs. There is NB 8.x For Java 8. The latest NB should be good for 10+, current and upcoming JDKs.\r\n\r\n[JDK 11](http://jdk.java.net/11/) has been available for months, just official release is in September. Even [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) is available, which I need to start building stuff against. I rather be ready for a new JDK before it releases, then after it releases. Playing catch up after a new JDK release. I had to do a tremendous amount of playing catch up for 9. I did not have that problem for 10, or 11, nor will I with 12. Just need to address the things that break under newer. I rather not fall behind again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/414147494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/414147714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/572#issuecomment-414147714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/572","id":414147714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDE0NzcxNA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-19T18:54:49Z","updated_at":"2018-08-19T18:54:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please let’s have this discussion on the dev mailing list, not in a pr.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/414147714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/414147877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/572#issuecomment-414147877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/572","id":414147877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDE0Nzg3Nw==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-19T18:57:34Z","updated_at":"2018-08-19T18:58:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You want to change the policy of netbeans, that can't be done with a small PR. You have an opinion and I respect that, but at this point you have yet to prove, that you are willing to work on the project.\r\n\r\nYour change breaks building on JDK 8 (at least you said so), but you also did not do the work necessary to make the whole project to build on JDK 11. So after your changeset is applied the project is not buildable anymore. That won't fly.\r\n\r\nI gave my reasoning, I offered pointers what could be done, others gave points what could be done.
