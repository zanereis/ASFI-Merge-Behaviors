Each underlying stream would then have to implement the logic to scan through. In case of Kafka, change in topic, or change in broker address should not be permitted (at least for some implementations). Some implementations may allow change in broker address as long as the topic is the same.\r\n\r\nFor Kinesis, appropriate checks need to be added.\r\n\r\nThanks for filing the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/854860935/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/854891478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7015#issuecomment-854891478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7015","id":854891478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NDg5MTQ3OA==","user":{"login":"timsants","id":3085767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODU3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3085767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants","html_url":"https://github.com/timsants","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timsants/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-04T17:29:24Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T17:29:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I suspect we are getting a conflict with the `org.reflections` library.

Please use raw index. It is supported for consuming segments now.\r\n\r\nIn case of kinesis, we should (may want to) also keep track of other metadata like partition IDs in the group during the time the segment was being consumed. I think these do not change (if they do, we close the segment), but @npawar  or @KKcorps  can comment on that.\r\n\r\nSince this is stream dependent, I would make it a string that has (at the minimum) the StreamMsgOffset serialized, and also the partition group ID. Beyond that, each stream may add its own stuff.\r\n\r\nAlso, consider having a less verbose version of this by having some data common to the entire segment, in the segment metadata (Some of these are there in zk metadata).

Tables are distributed across controllers, and it is assumed in Pinot that when one task runs for a table, it is not running for the same table in another controller.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review. I was basing these changes based on existing periodic tasks, which I believe runs on mutually exclusive set of tables.  Should we maintain states that need to be maintained when the task gets run on a given table on a given controller so that the other controller can skip running these tasks on the same table?

To optimize the file move, you can override `doMove()`\r\n\r\nWhat is the intention behind add `final` to `move`? Today's default `move()` implementation has a lot of customized logic before the `doMove()` and some bug/limitation. E.g., we found that it can not work with  base URLs with both hostname and port (e.g., “hdfs://localhost:58059”) because the code only consider hostname. That is why we think making it non-final. It is also consistent with other api in the same class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/857288816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/857295337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7032#issuecomment-857295337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7032","id":857295337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NzI5NTMzNw==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-09T01:09:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T01:09:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chenboat If you find bug in the `move()`, then feel free to fix it.

Until then, let's not introduce java 11 feature to the codebase.

My understanding is the overhead is mainly at networking side. For networking, the main cost is establishing connection, networking packet get queued/buffered in router, retransmission during networking jitter, etc. Unless the user only need query few columns while the table has hundreds/thousands of columns, the overhead of sending extra columns metadata is minimal.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any concerns, I can change it as: return NO columns's metadata by default if user does not provide any filter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/860430480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/860436747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7056#issuecomment-860436747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7056","id":860436747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MDQzNjc0Nw==","user":{"login":"mqliang","id":12423751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDIzNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12423751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang","html_url":"https://github.com/mqliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T07:04:02Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T07:08:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@siddharthteotia BTW, the PR change the metadata file layout, so will bring incompatibility.
