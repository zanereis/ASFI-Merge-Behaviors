@dsahlberg-apache-org ! Thank you so much for reviewing this PR! What you said is exactly what I was concerned about. Such a change would indeed render scripts that rely on command outputs unusable. To be honest, I'm not a seasoned SVN user, and this issue came up during conversations with my friends about their operations challenges. So, I submitted this commit with a \"let's give it a try\" mindset.\r\n\r\nI’d like to hear your thoughts on how we might improve this to partially retain the output format of the old version (i.e., properly displaying filenames that need escaping) while also supporting the current URI-style output. How could we achieve a balance between the two? I understand that removing the --summarize option allows filenames to display correctly, but it would be more helpful if filenames could be included in a single line. Thank you very much!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/subversion/issues/comments/2565444995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/subversion/issues/comments/2569759416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/subversion/pull/26#issuecomment-2569759416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/subversion/issues/26","id":2569759416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbud86ZK2q4","user":{"login":"hartmannathan","id":59230071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjMwMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59230071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan","html_url":"https://github.com/hartmannathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartmannathan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-03T20:11:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T20:11:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"In case you haven't seen it...
