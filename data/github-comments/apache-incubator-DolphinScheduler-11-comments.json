I do data mining so I pay more attention to its pain points.\r\n\r\nSince there're already tree diagrams for workflow instances group, I suggest hyperlinks start from there, this will be able to connect worflow group, workflow instances and task instances. Besides, addtional functions like \"multi-selecting\" and \"batch-running\" can be added here, since backfills or re-running are not always sequential.\r\n\r\nAs to DAG diagram for each workflow instance, I think it needs independent page where we can re-oganize dependencies inside the workflow instance( without effecting the group definition). For example, we can re-run the workflow from any node, it alwasy goes along downstream dependencies until the end or a node with multi-upstream dendencies. If we break or add certain dependency, the temporary-workflow goes and ends exactly the way we need. This, I suppose, is very useful for those long and halfway-interrupted workflow instances.\r\n\r\nFor your referrence.
