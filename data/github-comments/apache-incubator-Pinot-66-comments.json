Shouldn't we use ESRI for geography?\r\n\r\nGood call.\r\nThere are two reasons, as I found out during prototyping:\r\n- Performance. I found the serialization performance JTS is better than ESRI. This is also confirmed by Presto project, as they are migrating from ESRI to JTS: https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/13604\r\n- Simplicity on the dependency. With one less dependency, it's easier to manage the implementation. As in my current way, the geometry to geography conversion is just a simple change of coordinate system (SRID).\r\n\r\nThe tradeoff of taking this approach is that JTS is a library for Euclidean planar linear geometry, so all the geography-related operations have to be implemented using JTS's primitives. That's why there is some lengthy logic on geography measurement functions.

This might not mean that every application has to change their code. It could be handled in any of the blocks between the controller and the application (wrapper, onboarding platform).\r\n\r\nWe could look into making this a cluster level config - do you think that would be easier?\r\n\r\nIt is true that Calcite allows escaping. However we're seeing more and more users on the community use these keywords as columns and then spend time debugging/wondering why some queries are failing. Plus, with so many external integrations like SuperSet, ThirdEye, it is not easy to control the escaping of the keywords. \r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to parse the query on broker, identify keywords, and escape them,  before feeding to calcite parser. But then, we'd be introducing expensive regex, and it will be cumbersome to get completely exhaustive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/657733441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/657734359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4854#issuecomment-657734359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4854","id":657734359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzczNDM1OQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T18:59:09Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T18:59:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here is a design document for this task\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNlvnLKDNUuyRWOKYYF01FWW9weYMGoaLRtU-CueciM/edit?ts=5e38bdd0#heading=h.ngrw7r8gso5w","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/657734359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/657737205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5631#issuecomment-657737205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5631","id":657737205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzczNzIwNQ==","user":{"login":"junkaixue","id":6695617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTU2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6695617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue","html_url":"https://github.com/junkaixue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junkaixue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T19:05:10Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T19:10:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For this PR, from Helix dev perspective, it will not impact the correctness but could apply the throttling logic to make the bootstrap longer.

As long as Pinot is fine with that, this is a good change.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look and the confirmation\r\n> \r\n> BTW, Helix team does suggest to use throttling to controller the number of messages. For the number of the threshold, it is up to Pinot team to discuss.\r\n> \r\n> @yupeng9 Helix provide helix-rest module for supporting lot of REST APIs and running as a separated service. If you would like to use some advanced API, you can try that part.\r\n\r\nYes, I have been using `helix-admin-webapp` around it, and it's handy. Per @kishoreg's suggestion it is a good idea to add `helix-rest` to Pinot's cluster management APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/657751504/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/657758259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/5690#issuecomment-657758259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5690","id":657758259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Nzc1ODI1OQ==","user":{"login":"tmwangi","id":1154979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ5Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1154979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi","html_url":"https://github.com/tmwangi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmwangi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T19:52:40Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T19:52:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Cool.
