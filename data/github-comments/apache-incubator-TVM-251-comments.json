Here are some findings:\r\n\r\n1. If you do the FuseOps transform first on the relay graph, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\nseq = tvm.transform.Sequential(\r\n        [\r\n            transform.SimplifyInference(),\r\n            transform.FuseOps()\r\n        ]\r\n    )   \r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=opt_level):\r\n    mod = seq(mod)\r\n# build the model\r\n# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the final result is correct.\r\n\r\n2. If you use opt_level=4 to build the model, then the final result is also correct:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopt_level = 4\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=opt_level):\r\n    lib = relay.build(mod, target='llvm', params=param)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems pretty weird to me. So I disable some passes here, trying to dig deeper.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndisabled_pass = [\"CombineParallelConv2D\", \"CombineParallelDense\", \"CombineParallelBatchMatmul\", \"FastMath\"]\r\nopt_level = 4\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=opt_level, disabled_pass=disabled_pass):\r\n    lib = relay.build(mod, target='llvm', params=param)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, these four passes are the only ones that are enabled by default. However, disable these passes doesn't influence the final result: the result is still correct.\r\n\r\nMy environment:\r\n\r\nBuild from source at 2988a08e3ff4a8956ac9b23e662374f6d8f7f4d9,\r\n\r\nOS: macOS 10.15.7\r\n\r\nAs I'm new to TVM, I'm stuck here and can't dig deeper at present.

Some the the functions calls does not have guarantee about whether target is None. Therefore, instead of adding extra checks in occurrences, I changed the `check_and_update_host_consist` function and add a warning to warn about some corner cases. After all IMO empty target should not be a typical case in the system, and should be avoided in the future.
