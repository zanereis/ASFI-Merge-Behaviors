This time we added extra instrumentation and collected more data points, but we still failed to get a reproduce of the issue\r\n\r\n## Setup \r\nIceberg 0.13.0 and Flink 13 with S3 fileIO turned on (default config for MPU size and threshold)\r\n\r\n## Symptom\r\n- Iceberg committed a broken snapshot `3619033567453770968` which track a non-exist data file `00008-0-a771cfe9-b71d-4e84-b784-e3b270b0ff80-00514.parquet` at  2022-07-10 06:15:00.666 PST\r\n- Subsequent read of given partition failed with `FileNotFoundException` because process engine cannot find the problematic data files on S3\r\n\r\n## Mitigation\r\n- Use scripts from iceberg library to \"delete\" the dataFiles, something like\r\n```scala\r\nval table = getIcebergTable(s\"$db_name.$tbl_name\")\r\nval df = spark.sql(s\"select * from iceberg.$db_name.$tbl_name.files\")\r\nval dataf = df.filter(df(\"file_path\") === dataFileOfInterest).persist\r\n\r\nval origDataFileSize=dataf.select(\"file_size_in_bytes\").map(r => r.getLong(0)).collect().head\r\nval origDataFileRecordCount=dataf.select(\"record_count\").map(r => r.getLong(0)).collect().head\r\nval dt = DataFiles.builder(table.spec)\r\n.withPath(dataFileOfInterest)\r\n.withFileSizeInBytes(origDataFileSize)\r\n.withPartitionPath(origPartitionPath)\r\n.withRecordCount(origDataFileRecordCount)\r\n.build()\r\n\r\nval t = table.newTransaction\r\nt.newOverwrite().deleteFile(dt).commit()\r\nt.commitTransaction();\r\n```\r\n- However some of data consumer are using [Spark incremental read](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-queries/#incremental-read) to get list of appended data files in between snapshots and mitigation above can only help with read from latest snapshot, so there is no easy way for us to fix snapshot `3619033567453770968` but skip processing of this corrupted snapshot, which result in some data loss\r\n\r\n## Some investigation\r\n- We spent some time to collect the requests from AWS side and realized the S3 multipart upload get aborted at 2022-07-10 06:07:01.619 PST, or 8 minutes before snapshot was committed\r\n- The multipart upload abortion was caused by transient error in 1 of the upload-parts like `software.amazon.awssdk.core.exception.SdkClientException: Unable to execute HTTP request: Error writing to server` and all subsequent parts upload failed as expected.\r\n- Initially we are thinking maybe there's some exception gets swallowed so caller of https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/s3/S3OutputStream.java might not realize the problem of writing this parquet data files to S3. But we also spent some time in this AWS integration tests https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/aws/src/integration/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/s3/TestS3MultipartUpload.java and looks like S3OutputStream behave as expected -> If there's exception in threads to upload part, `java.util.concurrent.CompletionException` will bubble up as expected on `close()`\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- Correct expectation of using S3OutputStream? Is it safe to assume that iceberg is ready to commit if all writers can write its data and metadata files to fileIO and writers are close without exception?\r\n- We are curious about call path on how S3OutputStream is wired to IcebergStreamWriter ? (assume this is where commit of list of data files happens), there's a lot of complexity in between and hard to identify the exact caller of S3OutputStream\r\n- What else does community suggest to help root cause the actual problem and prevent it from happening again?\r\n\r\nCC @rdblue @danielcweeks @szehon-ho @jackye1995 @singhpk234 @stevenzwu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1185041892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1185042222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4588#issuecomment-1185042222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4588","id":1185042222,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Gok8u","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T00:12:35Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T00:12:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have been on a break.

Because no exception is thrown, the call to CompleteableFuture::join in completeMultipartUpload succeeds and should return null for that part.\r\n\r\nYes @rdblue and I think we also observed that, and align with what @danielcweeks suggested earlier in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4168#issuecomment-1123000990. I think rethrow after logging is desired, but subsequent multi-part uploads will also fail due to previous abort. We also attempted to reproduce abort MPU in integration tests , verified we can assert thrown exceptions on close.\r\n\r\n> Either way, it looks like some exception should cause close to fail, but that is apparently ignored since the writer creates metadata for the file.\r\n\r\nyep I think if there's any suggestion/pointers can help us understand why this is happening, it would be of tremendous help. Today we are seeing 3 more occurrence of this happening, some is related to flink TM out of memory/heap issue and somes are not, so have to disable S3FileIO for flink before this is root caused and prevention is in-place. On the other side, we have turned S3FileIO on for Spark for months now but never see any issue of similar kind.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1185805540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1185805672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1422#issuecomment-1185805672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1422","id":1185805672,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85GrfVo","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T18:34:45Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T18:34:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is very out of date, we never went forward with finishing it, so my current estimate would be the far future :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1185805672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1185848975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5282#issuecomment-1185848975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5282","id":1185848975,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Grp6P","user":{"login":"jfz","id":1302547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDI1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1302547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz","html_url":"https://github.com/jfz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T19:38:07Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T19:38:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another issue with `fromInputStream` is that it disables `close` of the original stream, and user is responsible for closing it outside of AWS SDK.

I will create a PR recently for a \"force\" option on `registerTable`.\r\n\r\n@yabola: You do not have to manually create a hive external table and set the table properties.\r\nYou can just do the following:\r\n```\r\nSET iceberg.catalog.hadoop_cat.type=hadoop;\r\nSET iceberg.catalog.hadoop_cat.warehouse=hdfs://example.com:8020/hadoop_cat;\r\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE database_a.table_a\r\nSTORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES ('iceberg.catalog'='hadoop_cat');\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if your table names are not matching you can do this:\r\n```\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE database_a.table_a\r\nSTORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler' \r\nLOCATION 'hdfs://some_bucket/some_path/other_table_name'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES ('iceberg.catalog'='location_based_table');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this the `database_a.table_a` will be accessible for Hive, and it could be queried as any normal Hive table.\r\n\r\nI think the main misunderstanding here is that you do not have to use HiveCatalog to query an Iceberg table. You can use whatever Catalog implementation you want to use, and tell the Hive table to use that specific Catalog implementation to access the data/metadata of the table.\r\n\r\nBack to the original question:\r\n- I think the external table approach is better if you want the table in the target catalog to follow the changes of the table in the source catalog. If there is a change committed to the original table, then the queries against the Hive table will immediately reflect the changes.\r\n- OTOH if you want to access a specific snapshot of the table then `registerTable` could be useful. In this case you should make sure that the original catalog will not expire / or remove files used by the tables registered in the HiveCatalog. (I still would prefer to see a feature in Hive for providing a specific snapshotId or metadata file location of a table in table properties, instead of registering a table in HiveCatalog.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1188008043/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1188008308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5300#issuecomment-1188008308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5300","id":1188008308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Gz5F0","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-18T18:10:04Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T18:10:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@flyrain @rdblue @stevenzwu @karuppayya @szehon-ho @RussellSpitzer @anuragmantri ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1188008308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1188045274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4168#issuecomment-1188045274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4168","id":1188045274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85G0CHa","user":{"login":"abmo-x","id":69539469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTM5NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69539469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x","html_url":"https://github.com/abmo-x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abmo-x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-18T18:19:49Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T18:34:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wanted to also add that we are seeing similar behavior for file which BaseTaskWriter logs as successfully completed and I don't see any errors for s3 upload in the logs around that time frame. \r\n\r\nBut the data file does not exist on S3, but the below log is logged which then adds the data file to the manifest.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  2022-07-15T14:49:35.869+00:00 \r\nlogger_name:  org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3OutputStream \r\n    message:  S3OutputStream initialized with S3_PATH_TO_FILE_THAT_DOESN'T_EXIST\r\n\r\n \r\n2022-07-15T15:04:08.447+00:00 \r\nlogger_name:  org.apache.iceberg.io.BaseTaskWriter \r\nComplete data file GenericDataFile{content=data, file_path=PATH_TO_FILE_THAT_DOESN'T_EXIST file_format=PARQUET, spec_id=0, partition=PartitionData{date=2022-07-15, hour=14}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur S3 bucket is versioned, no versions exists in s3 for that file.

@RussellSpitzer \r\nAdded a commit to clear currentWriter on close in BaseTaskWriter and added 2 test cases around failure to close and complete.\r\n\r\nI agree close should be only called once and we are relying on that behavior quite strongly and adding the data files. \r\nHowever I found that the writers are held and closed more than once in various scenarios which causes this issue where a close resulted in failure and writers end up in a bad state:\r\n\r\n1. when user defined functions catch all exceptions and ignore failures on write as seen in Flink's processElement which internally triggers a roll to new file.\r\n2.

The challenge to test retry is that it requires \"S3Mock\" code change and still tricky to get only a particular request to fail at first attempt and succeed later.
