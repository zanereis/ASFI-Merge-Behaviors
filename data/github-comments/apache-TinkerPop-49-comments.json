Maybe there should even be some details in the [Provider documentation](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/provider/#_implementing_gremlin_core)? Including some docs of this nature would be a nice addition, but I can probably write something up on merge if you like.

there concerns with https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9226 ? Is that a problem we introduce as a new exposed risk as a result of this PR or is it something that can happen now with how things work in `tp34`? \r\n\r\nI think the code changes seems fine from the best I can tell by just scanning through. I had a few nits around the \"deprecated\" bits of code. If you could just do a quick pass through and add the appropriate javadoc in the form we use, that would be great. For future reference, here's some additional information in our dev docs on the topic:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#_deprecation\r\n\r\nNo need to include the `@see` link everywhere to the JIRA i don't think....perhaps a strategically placed one somewhere would suffice. \r\n\r\nI would really like to see the documentation changes to consider it all a \"finished\" PR though. Specifically I think I'd like to see:\r\n\r\n1. User Documentation - delete the deprecated settings from the docs and modify configuration/best practices sections as needed to reflect how the driver works now.\r\n2. User Upgrade Documentation - something to call attention to this change and explains what was done and why (much of that is here in your PR description so you could probably copy/paste a bit) as well as what users need to do on upgrade to be sure everything works well.\r\n3. Provider Upgrade Documentation - document any things that might possibly break as a result of this change (you mentioned \"providers have provided a custom channelizer\" for example).\r\n\r\nStarting the process of testing manually now. Assuming I don't run into any problems there, when you push the documentation changes, I think this PR will be basically good to go.

The exception is handled by the handler and when we check for Connection.isDead(), it is actually alive at that time waiting for the response to the CloseWebSocket frame. This same connection gets allocated to the next request and at some time it receives the response to the CloseWS frame and the handler attached to the response closes the channel, in turn, closing the second request.\r\n\r\nIn the new client we plan to write for 3.5, we should handle this case in a better manner. Please note that Netty's behaviour wrt to CorruptedFrameException has changed as of 4.1.37.

Is there a way to approach this with an eye for deprecation? \r\n\r\nHere's some ideas I'm just throwing out there to consider.......they aren't fully thought through and just meant to foster some discussion.\r\n\r\nMaybe `OpProcessor` could deprecate `ThrowingConsumer<Context> select(final Context ctx) ` and introduce the `ResponseHandlerContext` version of that method which would have a default implementation of returning `null` (or maybe a static do-nothing marker `ThrowingConsumer` instance). Then in `OpSelectorHandler` we would just try that method first and if it returns `null` we just use the old deprecated method. I guess that would mean that `OpExecutorHandler` will need some further adjustment to handle both types of Pairs coming at it....maybe that's not so good.\r\n\r\nWhat about `Context`? Do we need both a `ResponseHandlerContext` and a `Context`? Now that I'm looking at it, I kinda wonder if we couldn't just merge the functionality of `ResponseHandlerContext` into `Context` and then deprecate `ResponseHandlerContext` and related methods? I did speak with @dimas-b for a bit and he didn't see any problem with merging the two - his reasoning for introducing `ResponseHandlerContext` was mostly to not alter what `Context` was basically doing as a simple holder for Gremlin Server objects as `ResponseHandlerContext` was bringing in actions like `writeAndFlush()`.  Maybe this is an avenue to explore?\r\n\r\nOther ideas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/505942660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/505946552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1149#issuecomment-505946552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1149","id":505946552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTk0NjU1Mg==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-26T16:21:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T16:21:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice pom work and great to see upgrade docs. \r\n\r\n> Migration to 3.5 will require some efforts.\r\n\r\ngood to know - thanks. \r\n\r\n> Looks like #1042 could be merged after this\r\n\r\nI will rebase that PR and see what happens.

I think that you need to implement this slightly differently. I don't think you want a new parameterizedTranslate(Bytecode) method. I think you just want:\r\npublic ParameterizedGroovyResult translate(Bytecode)\r\n**_Yes，I'm worried about changing to other files at the beginning. I have modified on your advice。_**\r\n\r\n4. it would be nice if this could all be implemented as a simple TypeTranslator because then we wouldn't need this special Translator implementation. Still thinking about how this might all \"just work\" so I could perhaps suggest more changes after these, but for now, I don't think that the constructor for ParameterizedGroovyTranslator should have a construction that take a simple TypeTranslator:\r\nbecause for it to extract parameters it needs a special kind of TypeTranslator (i.e. one that captures parameters like this one). So, you might need a new ParameterizedTypeTranslator interface to accomplish that. I wish you didn't though. Overall this needs a bit more thought to get t right.\r\n**_I think the constructor for ParameterizedGroovyTranslator have a construction that take a simple TypeTranslator may be sometimes valuable，the class  will be more extensible and provide an interface for user to customize personal Translator.ParameterizedScriptTranslator  just like ParameterizedSillyClassTranslator exhibited in ParameterizedGroovyTranslatorTest.java.\r\nIt will surely make code expanded and complicated somehow，I will accept your opinion with open heart. Hoping for your more constructive comments_**\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/509549203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/509579695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1159#issuecomment-509579695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1159","id":509579695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTU3OTY5NQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T10:04:43Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T10:04:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for this.

being used for more than just converting types which was its original intent so that providers/users could plugin their own conversions for custom types. If we implement things the way they are now, they not only have to write two separate TypeTranslators (if they want to support both forms of translation) but they also have to reason about Parameters. I'm not sure what the solution is there, but I think that's the next thing that's concerning me about this change that I don't have a good answer for yet.\r\n \r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/510100317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/510209734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1159#issuecomment-510209734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1159","id":510209734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDIwOTczNA==","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T20:09:01Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T20:09:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"VOTE +1 \r\n\r\nThe logic and the code change looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/510209734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/510468155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1158#issuecomment-510468155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1158","id":510468155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDQ2ODE1NQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T12:38:32Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T12:38:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've had some more time to think about this. I'm having trouble envisioning the complete impact to this change so please forgive me for suggesting changes that might seem like I'm taking this design in circles.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think that everything works more nicely if the `ScriptTranslator` interface changed and simply became:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface ScriptTranslator extends Translator<Script, String>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `Script` is what you currently have named `ParameterizedScript `. Going forward, `Script` can have parameters or not so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic Optional<Map<String,Object>> getParameters()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, `ParameterizedGroovyTranslator` can go away, and we can just use `GroovyTranslator` which will return a `Script` with or without parameters based on the `TypeTranslator` given to it. I think `DefaultTypeTranslator` should simply be configurable by way of the constructor to extract parameters or not. \r\n\r\nI think that these changes should allow you to get rid of the `ThreadLocal` in `Parameters` hopefully (another thing that was bothering me). It allows existing extensions of `DefaultTypeTranslator` to take advantage of `Parameters` in a way that doesn't make them have to reason about that (i.e. they can just add their custom types for conversion and choose whether they opt to parameterize them or not). I think it also unifies the API more nicely for downstream usage. All of this comes at the cost of a breaking change to our APIs, but I think that's acceptable.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that's all the changes that need to be done for this to be \"ready\", but I think I'd need to see them in place before I could say more. At least I'm seeing the bigger picture of how this fits more clearly now. Please let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nAlso, a couple of administrative notes:\r\n\r\n1. Please prefer `git rebase` when bringing in new changes from master to your branch (i see a merge commit on this PR - please remove that when you get a chance - thanks)\r\n2. Don't worry about travis too much - I tend to keep an eye on it and will let you know if there is a test that won't pass because of a change you made. Please consider using docker to validate your builds in addition to local maven builds as docker will run all tests across all Gremlin Language Variants - `docker/build.sh -t -i` will give you extraordinary confidence that your changes are \"good\".\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience with this pull request.

I understand your use of \"internal\" there in that it's sort of a in-the-weeds sort of class but `ResponseHandlerContext` more strictly speaking it's not really an internal class in the sense that it was scoped public and then also part of methods that were public and therefore possibly utilized in some fashion (likely by providers and not so much end users). Obviously, if the class were scoped in a fashion that didn't allow folks to use it directly then there wouldn't be a problem with just removing it.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that we don't make exceptions or never have breaking compile time changes (pretty rare I think which I like to take some pride in), but personally I prefer them more as a last resort as I imagine that few providers want to fuss very much with their implementations on older TinkerPop release lines (like `tp33`). Just trying to keep the wheels greased for upgrade as much as possible. \r\n\r\nIs this a case for allowing the breaking change through? It's not a clear \"yes\" in my mind, since I *think* I see a pretty simple deprecation path. Of course, the fix for a provider who upgraded would be fast/easy plus they get a good bug fix for making the change, so if we let it go as-is, it wouldn't be the end of the world - some upgrade docs would probably be required for providers so that they were aware of the change and it would be all good. \r\n\r\nSo, sorry to make you shift one more time, but if you can take the deprecation approach without breaking compile time on upgrade, then let's do that. If you're sick of working on this ticket, I can finish it up for you. Just let me know.\r\n\r\nFor the future, prefer deprecation with no breaks in compilation/behavior on older branches.
