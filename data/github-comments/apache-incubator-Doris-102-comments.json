thanks for your reply, I will answer inline\r\n\r\n> The lru cache is used globally in Doris, and the resize is very low frequency. It will only be resized frequently when the BE is cold started.\r\n\r\nA bit of context for this PR: we observed several latency spikes after restarting BE and found that it's caused by the resize operation (see the graph below), so we'd like to improve the resize operation in order to avoid any query timeout.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1198446/168571937-1e01780a-bc8e-44ca-af62-712978711751.png)\r\n\r\nThe cluster uses 200G page cache per BE and resizing single shard to 8 million entries took >2 seconds.\r\n\r\n> Please provide test results to demonstrate the performance and memory usage benefits of singly linked list, especially at high concurrency.\r\n\r\nI wrote a simple program to test the resize speed. From the results, we can see that for large resize, this PR reduces the resize duration by 60%. This PR also reduces the memory usage, but it's not our main concern.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- before the PR\r\nresize to 16 takes 5 us\r\nresize to 32 takes 6 us\r\nresize to 64 takes 6 us\r\nresize to 128
