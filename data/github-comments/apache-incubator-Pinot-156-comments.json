issue happened again, but we were able to get more logs this time. It seems like:\r\n\r\n1. Job sends segment upload request controller\r\n2. Controller processes upload, adds segment to property store\r\n3. Controller starts shutting down including ZK conn\r\n4. Controller fails to update ideal state and delete segment from property store due to ZK conn closed\r\n5. Upload request fails\r\n\r\nThe batch job that performed the push seemed to succeed surprisingly. When we try to perform the upload again by re-running the push job, it does a no-op because it finds the segment already, but nothing updates the ideal state.\r\n\r\nIt seems like ideally either re-running the push would allow the ideal state to get updated? Or the controller should be able to repair this async so the ideal state gets updated?\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-10-07 01:49:04.335934] INFO [PinotSegmentUploadDownloadRestletResource:324]

Please take a look and let me know what you think. \r\n\r\n> If Linkedin is using `MessageBatch<IndexedRecord>`, does that mean Linkedin is also using its own implementation of kafka consumer and not the OSS plugin? \r\n\r\nYes. LinkedIn has a custom kafka consumer implementation. \r\n\r\n>  I am curious why Linkedin does this? isn't is expensive to deserialize every record until when the deserialized payload is actually needed? The consumer's contract should not involve deserializing the payload. Can you please explain why this is useful?\r\n\r\nLinkedIn's kafka consumer directly fetches the deserialized payload . AFAIK, Linkedin Kafka has a schema registry where the payload's schema is registered. So they provide (optimized) deser and do not allow clients to have their own deserialization. @sajjad-moradi  to add more details, if any. \r\n\r\nJust to give more clarity about linkedin's custom implementation of interfaces: \r\n\r\n- `LiKafkaMessageBatch implements MessageBatch<IndexedRecord>`\r\n- `LiKafkaConsumer extends PartitionLevelConsumer`\r\n- `LiKafkaDecoder implements StreamMessageDecoder<IndexedRecord>`\r\n\r\n> I also don't understand the point about \"unnecessary type conversion\" here. Can you please elaborate?\r\n\r\nI meant additional serialization and deserialization. Edited the description.\r\n\r\n> Using generics forces the segment manager implementation to deal with raw usage of parameterized classes (due to type erasures) and make the code hard to read and maintain. \r\n\r\nAs per my understanding of the code, SegmentManager only deals with GenericRow once the deserialization is done.  Depending on various implementations, `MessageBatch<T>` and `StreamMessageDecoder<T>` interfaces take care of abstracting the messages and decoding. Each implementation can deal with the formats they wish. So can you please clarify what you mean by making the **SegmentManager** code harder to read and maintain?\r\n\r\n> Besides, StreamMessage is meant to abstract the entire incoming payload. Using only the type of the record's \"value\" in this generic class seems prohibitive.\r\n\r\nI agree with this part. We can discuss and arrive at the best way to do this. But IMO, forcing `StreamMessage` to have key and value of type `bytes[]` seems counter-intuitive based on the OSS code flow. I've tried to explain the issue below.\r\n\r\nThis is my understanding of our OSS code prior to #9224:\r\n1. Get a batch of messages:\r\n`MessageBatch<T> messageBatch = PartitionLevelConsumer.fetchMessage();`\r\n2. `for (message in MessageBatch<T>)`, decode the message\r\n`GenericRow row = StreamMessageDecoder<T>.decode(message)`\r\n\r\nNote that MessageBatch is a generic interface because users of Pinot are free to use their custom kafka (or other) client implementations that could return messages in any format.\r\n\r\nAfter #9224, the code looks as follows:\r\n1. Get a batch of messages:\r\n      `MessageBatch<T> messageBatch = PartitionLevelConsumer.fetchMessage();`\r\n2. Get each message and store it in a StreamMessage wrapper. Note that StreamMessage stores values only as byte[].\r\n       `byte[] StreamMessage.value = messageBatch.getMessageValue(index)`\r\n3. Decode StreamMessage\r\n      `GenericRow row = StreamMessageDecoder<T>.decode(StreamMessage.value())`\r\n\r\nLooking at the above, it looks like we've introduced a new step (2), where we are forcing messages of generic type (MessageBatch) to be serialized to `byte[]` and go back to working on generic types again in `StreamMessageDecoder`.\r\nAs you mentioned, the new code assumes that when messages are read from the stream consumer, they will always be in serialized format.  But the existing code for `MessageBatch<T>` and `StreamMessageDecoder<T>` doesn't honor the assumption.  Note that the intermediate byte[] array just acts as a passthrough (is not used anywhere other than for decoding in StreamMessageDecoder) sandwiched between two interfaces that use generic types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1272076485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1272093407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9554#issuecomment-1272093407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9554","id":1272093407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5L0prf","user":{"login":"vvivekiyer","id":21298365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjk4MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21298365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer","html_url":"https://github.com/vvivekiyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvivekiyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T21:17:03Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T21:19:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@walterddr  Based on my understanding, pinot does not guarantee the ordering of elements in the record of an MV column.

But here is my take on this:\r\n\r\n> MessageBatch is a generic interface because users of Pinot are free to use their custom kafka (or other) client implementations that could return messages in any format. \r\n\r\nI understand the flexibility that this generic MessageBatch provides. But we want to get a more stronger interface contract so that the development of a plugin becomes trivial and streamlined. Features we can add:\r\n* Filtering records based on message metadata (benefit: avoid payload de-serialization cost)\r\n* Compute time to deserialize a payload\r\n* Streamline handling of decode failures \r\n\r\n> As you mentioned, the new code assumes that when messages are read from the stream consumer, they will always be in serialized format. But the existing code for MessageBatch<T> and StreamMessageDecoder<T> doesn't honor the assumption.\r\n\r\nYes. that was the whole point of changing to the new code. I was trying to de-couple the \"decoding\" of a message from \"fetching\" of a message from the stream. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"546\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-10 at 10 51 20 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1909480/194803076-aa074171-b322-4d5a-86a7-b1a4d326e651.png\">\r\n\r\n> Just to give more clarity about linkedin's custom implementation of interfaces:\r\n> LiKafkaMessageBatch implements MessageBatch<IndexedRecord>\r\n> LiKafkaConsumer extends PartitionLevelConsumer\r\n> LiKafkaDecoder implements StreamMessageDecoder<IndexedRecord>\r\n\r\nIirc, Linkedin has multiple client libraries and I am fairly certain that almost all of them, except `linked-kafka-clients` allow you to customize the serde/deserde in their clients. Moreover, Linkedin's avro decoder is also a separate library that can be used in your custom implementation as `LiKafkaDecoder implements StreamMessageDecoder<byte[]>` \r\n\r\nCan you help me understand why this approach cannot be used by Linkedin pinot ?

was actually considering using IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY as a way to implement rudimentary nested column support.  I think this could potentially be implemented natively without the need for IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY in the future as well.\r\n\r\nImagine a table named foo with data organized like so, based on the [json index docs](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/json-index#when-to-use-json-index):\r\n\r\n\r\n|   id   |   name   |  age  |    country |  parent_id |   addresses.number |   addresses.street |   addresses.country |\r\n|--------|----------|-------|------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\r\n| 1      | \"adam\"   | 30    | \"us\"       |  1      |   null             |   null             |   null              |\r\n| null   | null     | null  |  null      |  1         |   112              |   \"main st\"        |   \"us\"              |\r\n| null   | null     | null  |  null      |  1         |   2                |   \"second st\"      |   \"us\"              |\r\n| null   | null     | null  |  null      |  1         |   3                |   \"third st\"       |   \"ca\"              |\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would allow for rich filtering support using all existing indexing techniques in Pinot with “context” maintained.  Ex: “Who has lived in us while having an address number greater than 3?” (adam would match). Could use range index on addresses.number to make filters as efficient as possible.  (age filter only present to show mixture of parent and nested filtering)\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT name, age, country\r\nFROM foo\r\nWHERE\r\n  IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY(id, 'SELECT ID_SET(parent_id) FROM foo WHERE addresses.number > 3 AND addresses.country = ''us'' ') = 1\r\n  AND age > 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas a similar query of “Who has lived in ca while having an address number greater than 3?” (adam would not match)\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT name, age, country\r\nFROM foo\r\nWHERE\r\n  IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY(id, 'SELECT ID_SET(parent_id) FROM foo WHERE addresses.number > 3 AND addresses.country = ''ca'' ') = 1\r\n  AND age > 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would also support querying “across” multiple records for the same parent_id i.e. “bypassing” context. Ex: “Has Adam ever lived in ca , and also lived on main st at some point?”\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT name, age, country\r\nFROM foo\r\nWHERE\r\n  IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY(id, 'SELECT ID_SET(parent_id) FROM foo WHERE addresses.country = ''ca''') = 1\r\n  AND IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY(id, 'SELECT ID_SET(parent_id) FROM foo WHERE addresses.street = ''main st''') = 1\r\n  AND age > 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pattern would also support efficient aggregation of values from the \"nested\" column (as compared to something like `jsonextractscalar` which needs to deserialize every match to accomplish the same).  Ex. (note the inversion of `id` and `parent_id` in the use of `IN_PARTITIONED_SUBQUERY` this time, given that we want the result set to include the nested rows as well, and not only the parent rows).  This is where it's important that the parent row have id == parent_id so that nested elements can be grouped with their parent (if aggregated).\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT parent_id, name,
