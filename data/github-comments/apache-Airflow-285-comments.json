For example the baseoperator->helpers cyclic import is caused by \"chain\" method in helpers. BaseOperator uses helpers module and helpers.chain() method uses BaseOperator. This all can be resolved by careful untangling of modules. Sometimes what helps is putting together things that are actually coupled by historically are in separate modules.

It's typical manifestation of cyclical imports where you thing various methods are coupled and put them together for a wrong reason. \r\nIf you look what db module now is: \"let's use it for any kind of db  operations\". \r\n\r\nBut in fact there are two different purpose it serves now:\r\n* provide methods that are used everywhere for DB operations (including models) - `provide_session` is such method. Those methods are USED by the models.\r\n* provide methods that are used to group together db methods for multiple models (those methods are USING models).\r\n\r\nPutting those two types of methods introduces coupling between them unnecessarily. That's exactly what is causing the cyclic imports. \r\n\r\nWe should split the db module into two independent modules.

Originally I set out to: \"Provide a primitive to construct operators that allow retry / failing of starting a long running external job without blocking a worker for the entire duration of that long running job\" For this, We might consider some very different approach:\r\nInstead of thinking about this as a rescheduling pokes problem, think of it as special kind of SubDag pattern we want to better support: achieve the desired behavior by having a start task and a rescheduling pokes sensor for completion task inside a SubDag. (This might be DOA / short-sighted as I think SubDagOperator task actually blocks a worker to monitor the SubDag completion). But could we perhaps refocus this effort on improving how SubDags monitor for completion? \r\n\r\nHowever, there was some discussion that adding support for stateful tasks in airflow would have broader impact than just this rescheduling case.\r\n\r\nFrom my read through all these threads it seems the key open questions for the rescheduling approach similar to this PR are:\r\n- Per @JonnyIncognito  we need to get a strong consensus around scope of idempotency. Does each (rescheduled) task instance have to be idempotent, or does a task need to be idempotent before succeeding or failing?\r\n- Where should rescheduling logic lie in the class structure? (it seems like it should be moved to BaseOperator).\r\n- Is a TaskState model/table preferable to the changes it would take for XCom? and what other use cases should be considered in its schema??\r\n- Should we explore persisting information in the context object.\r\n\r\nI'm not that familiar w/ AIP process and if it's something a small group of people from the community get aligned on in a meeting/slack before filing or something and individual just proposes.\r\n@Fokko @JonnyIncognito @dstandish @mik-laj you all seem to have vested interest in this would you be open to scheduling a meeting or some time to discuss synchronously over slack?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569481697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569493832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6944#issuecomment-569493832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6944","id":569493832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTQ5MzgzMg==","user":{"login":"tooptoop4","id":33283496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjgzNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33283496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4","html_url":"https://github.com/tooptoop4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-29T10:47:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T10:47:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drsantos20 i couldn't see a test for original task_stats functionality, as this change is guarded by opt-in config then no impact for existing users","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569493832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569495320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6905#issuecomment-569495320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6905","id":569495320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTQ5NTMyMA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-29T11:09:18Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T11:09:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mik-laj - should we add this graph to the documentation once merged?
