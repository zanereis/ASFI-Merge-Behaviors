a lot of changes have accumulated, I'll re-summarize the changes:\n\nChanges to the new API:\n- GobblinInstanceLauncher/GobblinInstanceDriver\n  - Renamed GobblinInstanceLauncher.getName() to GobblinInstanceLauncher.getInstanceName()\n  - Made GobblinInstanceLauncher extend configurable since it is responsible of holding the system configuration\n- JobCatalog/JobSpec:\n  - Refactored the register/unregister methods into a separate interface - JobCatalogListenersContainer\n  - Reworked JobSpec.Builder to be convention-based and be able to reuse some of the properties in the Job configuration\n-  JobExecutionLauncher/JobExecutionDriver\n  - Added the class JobExecutionDriver to control/monitor the execution of a single gobblin job\n  - JobExecutionLauncher is not a factory for JobExecutionDriver instances\n  - Add JobExecutionStateListenerContainer interface for managing JobExecutionStateListener instances\n- JobExecutionStatus/JobExecutionState\n  - JobExecutionStatus is now an interface\n  - JobExecutionState is now responsible for the state management (including callbacks)\n\nImplementations:\n- Added a sample implementation JobLauncherExecutionDriver of JobExecutionDriver which acts as an adapter to the legacy JobLauncher/JobLauncherFactory API\n- Added DefaultGobblinInstanceDriverImpl which accepts all components but it is not responsible for managing them. This implementation can be used as a shell to implement a typical Gobblin job lifecycle\n- Added StandardGobblinInstanceDriver which will be responsible for instantiating and managing the instance components and passing them to DefaultGobblinInstanceDriverImpl\n- Added StandardGobblinInstanceLauncher-- a very rudimentary implementation to instantiate StandardGobblinInstanceDriver\n- Standard implementations for JobCatalogListenersContainer (JobCatalogListenersList) and JobExecutionStateListenerContainer (JobExecutionStateListeners)\n- The above use a generic callback infrastructure in gobblin-utility/gobblin/util/callbacks\n  - Callbacks a typically represented through a Function<L, R> where L is the listener type and R is the callback result (or Void)\n  - There is a helper class Callback<L, R> to let adding some human-readable description of the callback\n  - Callbacks are created by a CallbackFactory which is responsble for binding any parameters that need to be passed to the callback\n  - Callbacks are managed by CallbacksDispatcher\n\nChanges to legacy code:\n- Documentation and helper methods in JobState to decrease reliance on direct access to job properties\n- Added a description of current state diagram for RunningState based on code inspection\n- Helper methods in JobContext\n- Added a method JobLauncherFactory. newJobLauncher() method to allow instantiating a specific JobLauncher type instead of relying on the job config\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/238688472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/238689134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1178#issuecomment-238689134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1178","id":238689134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODY4OTEzNA==","user":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T20:58:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T20:58:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As

Right now the implementation uses a public API (the fact that you need a constructor that takes state to instantiate a HiveSourceWatermarker implementation) that is undocumented and only visible in an obscure code location.\n\nWhat  I mean was:\na) Keep the HiveSourceWatermarkerFactory interface. \nb) Have at least two implementations PartitionLevelWatermarker.Factory and TableLevelWatermarker.Factory \nc) Have HIVE_SOURCE_WATERMARKER_FACTORY_KEY instead of HIVE_SOURCE_WATERMARKER_CLASS_KEY\nd) Always instantiate the factory class from HIVE_SOURCE_WATERMARKER_FACTORY_KEY using the default constructor.\ne) Invoke createFromState() on the above instance.\n\nI would even suggest that we go as far as not having the constructor for PartitionLevelWatermarker and TableLevelWatermarker take a state in the constructor but only the parts of the sate that they need. It should be the factory which adapts from the passed state to whatever is needed for the construction of  PartitionLevelWatermarker and TableLevelWatermarker.\n\nRight now the code is full of these opaque reflection invocations and passing of state which is a glorified map. This completely obfuscates what is used where and we keep having this unintended consequence when changing something in the state.\n\nIf we want to program in Python, we should program in Python, not abuse Java :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/240896146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/240908837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1213#issuecomment-240908837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1213","id":240908837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDkwODgzNw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T02:04:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T02:04:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/7516943/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/7516943)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.05%) to 46.703% when pulling **e253bf8a6b3d16a3415c2f1251041d00945c9552 on chavdar:new_std_driver3** into **13a37da4d404ecd906368434aac0cab5e944c8b3 on linkedin:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/240908837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
