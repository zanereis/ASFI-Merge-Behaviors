I've addressed your comments.\n\nTo describe the change related to event handlers, this PR removes redundant wrapping of comm group event handlers.\nCurrent implementation of `CommunicationGroupDriverImpl` adds topology handlers to `commGroup*Handler`, and `GroupCommDriverImpl` adds `commGroup*Handler` to `groupComm*Handler`. For `GroupCommMessageHandler`, we distinguish `commGroupMessageHandler` of different comm groups and hand over `GroupCommunicationMessage` to specific `commGroupMessageHandler`. On the other hand, we do not distinguish specific comm group (running task, failed task, failed evaluator) handlers from others,  handing over all events to all comm group handlers, and thus this wrapping is redundant.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/150223985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/150350471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/582#issuecomment-150350471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/582","id":150350471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDM1MDQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T20:42:30Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T20:42:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here is my comments in general:\n*The result handler needs to be implemented by client.
