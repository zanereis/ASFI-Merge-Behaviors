This is done to make it be consistent with the `clearOffloadDeletionLag` call and is also required in order to differentiate between the case of no overridden value for the namespace and of having offloading disabled.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if I have a cluster wide namespace default of 12 hours but I want to disable offloading (by setting the value to -1) for a single namespace, then I can't use -1 also as the the sentinel value to see if the namespace has an overridden value as it is ambiguous.\r\n\r\nThere is another option here, which is to have `0` disable offloading and `-1`  be used as the default value, however, that still makes the API inconsistent with the other similar configuration option of `offloadDeletionLag`. It seems like there should be a consistent pattern for all of these configuration options and I am happy to do whatever fits that consistent pattern.

But the application can also be unresponsive for many reasons. \r\n\r\nThe particular cause is not important here. My point is that the motivation for implementing DLQ was to prevent this https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/189, https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2400.
