for the fix Bill. I just dug into this after I saw the patch because I remember backward compatibility discussion on the PR introducing the new configs and deprecating the old ones (cf https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2466/files#r113312570). Back than, internally we did not change Streams code to *use* the new `defaultKeySerde`/`defaultValueSerde` but still used the deprecated once (maybe this is part of the issues -- we should have switched immediately instead of calling the deprecated methods). Thus, originally it was backwards compatible as the old method got updated to check for old and new config. However, later on we replaced the old method calls to the new once and this broke it... (cf https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/2265834803649d2f9fb090e86d11309f6e9789cb)\r\n\r\nI am reporting this to give some context, so we can make sure this does not happen in the future again. (\\cc @jeyhunkarimov just FYI -- I broke it :(, not you)\r\n\r\nHowever, this raises some questions now: should we first check for the old or new config (it might even be different for the old and new method (maybe the old method should not even consider the new config at all?). What should we do, if we find both configs? Or is this a case we don't need to consider as people would just *change* the config name but never use old and new name at the same time?
