But it looks like there are other candidates for the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm taking a look at `Window.setLocationRelativeTo()`, one comment in the javadoc is\r\n```\r\nNote: If the lower edge of the window is out of the screen, then the window is placed to the \r\nside of the Component that is closest to the center of the screen. So if the component is on \r\nthe right part of the screen, the window is placed to its left, and vice versa.\r\n```\r\nwhich seems to echo the noted behavior.\r\n\r\nIn any event, knowing the arg in `setLocationRelativeTo( findFocusedWindow() )` in NbPresenter.initBounds() is important for getting to the bottom of what's going on. Also seeing `getLocation()` for the various components and the precise code path and intermediate values would be useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1397371539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1397554774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5309#issuecomment-1397554774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5309","id":1397554774,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5TTP5W","user":{"login":"tbw777","id":15821889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIxODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15821889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777","html_url":"https://github.com/tbw777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-19T20:26:23Z","updated_at":"2023-01-28T15:59:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think == is more preffered becouse of no methods used and also because compile time type checking\r\n\r\nI was scaned the project and no enums with equals exist.

If we don't do anything about the dialog size, then vertically centering the icons improves the appearance of the dialogs.\r\n\r\nto me it marginally improves the look of a **certain** type of dialog: one line messages\r\nOn the [screenshot](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5335#issue-1551528823) you provided, both before and after windows look to me as if someone placed labels on a frame without bothering to configure the layout or frame size. Both do look unfinished.\r\n\r\n> If we do fix the dialog size, then the cases where vertically centering the icon looks bad go away.\r\n\r\nIt makes the situation worse for already existing dialogs which display [more content](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5335#issuecomment-1399358156). Fixing the size there would still have the icon centered which looks non-standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is of course just my opinion. However, I do believe that it is fairly common to anchor an icon to the NW corner in dialogs. I can see the same layout in the master pw window of thunderbird or firefox for example:\r\n\r\n![thunder-pw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114367/213916349-116b1998-9b51-4bc3-b0c4-a56c0f968470.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nanother example is the standard gnome keychain unlock dialog:\r\n\r\n![unlock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114367/213916779-9e6514a1-8cd0-45b1-ad13-1b9da28be024.png)\r\n\r\nSince this UI pattern works for both, small dialogs and big dialogs, it probably became popular and also made it into JDK's dialog utilities. I don't see it as a bug, the bug appears to be the incorrect sizing of the content inserted right from the icon which causes this weird behavior since the window can't pack correctly. A 1 line label isn't 90 pixels tall, yet it is what its preferred size is for some reason and someone [tried to fix this before](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5335#issuecomment-1399353457).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1399481151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1399481777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5327#issuecomment-1399481777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5327","id":1399481777,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5TamWx","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-22T13:17:27Z","updated_at":"2023-01-22T13:17:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@NicolaIsotta thanks for the info.

Any PR that picked up the spec version change from master would require rebasing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1400074529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1400103563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5340#issuecomment-1400103563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5340","id":1400103563,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Tc-KL","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-23T10:16:22Z","updated_at":"2023-01-23T10:19:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pepness that's _your_ call!  https://lists.apache.org/thread/hyjbsz55zb9xfcnccghkrsvqsnt83nwf\r\n\r\nAs @mbien said the commit needs rebasing onto the delivery branch - added `do not merge` while pending.
