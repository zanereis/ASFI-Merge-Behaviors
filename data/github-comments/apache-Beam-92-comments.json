think it may be worth starting a quick thread on the dev list about the `attempted()` vs. `committed()` thing. I believe we added it to add clarity and make provide parity with Aggregators, where we can get the exactly-right answer out of Pipeline Results. Given that Metrics don't provide the same consistency guarantees, another option would be relaxing (or even removing) the requirement that reported Metrics are queryable via `PipelineResult`. This would make the tests a bit trickier, since each runner would need to configure how to do testing, but it would simplify the runner implementation.

the ticket for motivating particulars. It is possible to solve these at the protocol level in many ways. But that is not as good, for (at least) the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. We don't - and shouldn't - control all protocols. It is a principle hallmark of good work that it can be used in ways you never thought of. If the original code was written to be context-unaware, we wouldn't be having this discussion because everything would just work. It is very easy to concoct protocols and formats that are slightly better but require nonempty data elements. If you want to come up with some, play with ideas like \"how many elements do these zero bytes represent? where are the zero-byte encoded elements in this list that also has non-empty elements? did I just receive an empty element over the wire? how do I block until an empty element is transmitted?\" These all have workarounds via framing or sentinels but they can be more efficient without such.\r\n2. Using a dummy byte as you suggest means that no user encoding can use that byte, so all encodings must be prefixed with a \"non-empty\" byte or else must just be larger because they cannot use the dummy byte. So everyone is penalized and this is just one case of 3. For textual base64 this works OK because it already wastes bits and there are characters available, but that is context-aware programming and I'd rather not make excuses for hacks when I could improve them.\r\n3. Tracking empty vs nonempty encodings usually requires space for every encoded element whether or not it is empty, either with sentinel values or framing information. This is currently the case for Dataflow, the motivation behind ticket. There is a 1 byte penalty on every namespace because we tried to avoid a 1 byte penalty for `GlobalWindow`. It was certainly net negative. Using a spare dummy byte would work and probably end up unnoticeable, though it is in many tight loops so we'd have to measure.\r\n\r\nI obviously thought of the natural approach you suggest, but decided not to do it. I might do it someday, with careful benchmarking of the cost/benefit, but might not bother.\r\n\r\nI've worked around this issue for now; this PR is now largely code health and best practices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/273859187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/273865336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1797#issuecomment-273865336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1797","id":273865336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mzg2NTMzNg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T18:57:41Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T18:57:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
