I hava finished code,but still need your help\r\nwhat I did like this :\r\n\r\n- first,I added a configuration in `org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.conf.Config.Plugin`\r\n\r\n![image-20210817171232899](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210817171232899.png)\r\n\r\nas you said `ext_class_loader related`,it's named `EXT_INSTRUMENTATION_PLUGINS`\r\n\r\n- second,I added a property named `isExtInstrumentation`  and its `getter/setter` in `AbstractClassEnhancePluginDefine`\r\n\r\n![image-20210817171851874](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210817171851874.png)\r\n\r\n​\t\tand I did something similar in `PluginFinder`\r\n\r\n![image-20210817172418362](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210817172418362.png)\r\n\r\n-  third,I use `PluginInitializer` to initialize a `AbstractClassEnhancePluginDefine` instance. during this process,If the name of the plugin matches the configuration, the set method will be called and `isExtInstrumentation` will be set to true\r\n\r\n![image-20210817172940344](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210817172940344.png)\r\n\r\n- at last,I added in `org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.bootstrap.BootstrapInstrumentBoost#inject`\r\n\r\n![image-20210817180058212](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210817180058212.png)\r\n\r\nwhich code like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate static void prepareExtInstrumentation(PluginFinder pluginFinder, Map<String, byte[]> classesTypeMap) {\r\n    TypePool typePool = TypePool.Default.of(BootstrapInstrumentBoost.class.getClassLoader());\r\n    // getExtClassMatchDefine is a new method I metationed above\r\n    List<AbstractClassEnhancePluginDefine> extClassMatchDefines = pluginFinder.getExtClassMatchDefine();\r\n    for (AbstractClassEnhancePluginDefine define : extClassMatchDefines) {\r\n        // InstanceMethod use v2Interceptor\r\n        if (Objects.nonNull(define.getInstanceMethodsInterceptV2Points())) {\r\n            for (InstanceMethodsInterceptV2Point point : define.getInstanceMethodsInterceptV2Points()) {\r\n                if (point.isOverrideArgs()) {\r\n                    generateDelegator(classesTypeMap, typePool,\r\n                                      INSTANCE_METHOD_V2_WITH_OVERRIDE_ARGS_DELEGATE_TEMPLATE, point.getMethodsInterceptorV2());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    generateDelegator(classesTypeMap, typePool, INSTANCE_METHOD_V2_DELEGATE_TEMPLATE,\r\n                                      point.getMethodsInterceptorV2());\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\t\t // supprot consutrctor interceptor\r\n        if (Objects.nonNull(define.getConstructorsInterceptPoints())) {\r\n            for (ConstructorInterceptPoint point : define.getConstructorsInterceptPoints()) {\r\n                generateDelegator(classesTypeMap, typePool, CONSTRUCTOR_DELEGATE_TEMPLATE,\r\n                                  point.getConstructorInterceptor());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\t\t\r\n        // staticMethod use v2Interceptor\r\n        if (Objects.nonNull(define.getStaticMethodsInterceptV2Points())) {\r\n            for (StaticMethodsInterceptV2Point point : define.getStaticMethodsInterceptV2Points()) {\r\n                if (point.isOverrideArgs()) {\r\n                    generateDelegator(classesTypeMap, typePool,\r\n                                      STATIC_METHOD_V2_WITH_OVERRIDE_ARGS_DELEGATE_TEMPLATE, point.getMethodsInterceptorV2());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    generateDelegator(classesTypeMap, typePool, STATIC_METHOD_V2_DELEGATE_TEMPLATE,\r\n                                      point.getMethodsInterceptorV2());\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's all I did. I do not know if it is acceptable, eager to look forward to your opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/900168921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/900172809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3661#issuecomment-900172809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3661","id":900172809,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls841p4wJ","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-17T10:17:48Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T10:17:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have you tried to directly change the PluginConfig?

We could add a new field in `AbstractClassEnhancePluginDefine` called `isExtClassLoaderLoaded`(boolean). According to the `Config#Plugin#PLUGINS_IN_EXT_CLASS_LOADER`, the field value could be set to true(false in default)\r\n\r\nThat's what I did with the first and second points I mentioned above. And I will rename the configuration to `PLUGINS_IN_EXT_CLASS_LOADER` and field to `isExtClassLoaderLoaded`。\r\n\r\nI have enhanced `loadPlugins` method with `PluginInitializer` in the third point I mentioned\r\n\r\n![image-20210817235622360](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210817235622360.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Then you could control all the logic according to this. And rename the methods according, `xxxBootstrapyyy` -> `xxxBootstrapAndExtyyy`, because they should share the same logic, right?\r\n\r\nI believe I got your idea. When constructing the `PluginFinder`，I just need to push every `ExtClassLoaderLoaded` pluginDefine to `bootstrapClassAndExtClassMatchDefine` list,whose original name is `bootstrapClassMatchDefine`\r\n\r\n![image-20210818002853746](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210818002853746.png)\r\n\r\nIs this right?

All env vars in GitHub actions should be (expected to be) passed downwards to e2e program, but as we use container in GHA the env vars are not implicitly passed so we need to do that manually. @mrproliu Seems more and more problems arise after we use Docker container in GHA.
