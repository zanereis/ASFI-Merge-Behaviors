At every heartbeat (every minute, but configuraable), a connection would be created and destroyed.\n\nAnother longer term solution would be to go through a REST api call.

For example in the `HiveOperator`, the `hql` attribute is templated and `.hql` files will get resolved by Jinja. You have the choice to pass an HQL string, or a reference to a file.\n\nFor BashOperator it's more confusing since things like `bash myscript.sh` will result in a TemplateNotFound error. Adding a space a the end bypasses BaseOperator trying to resolve the file.\n\nNote that the files are resolved relative to where the pipeline file lives. You can also add other folders to the `template_searchpath` as you create the DAG object.\nhttp://pythonhosted.org/airflow/code.html#airflow.models.DAG\n\nThe magic takes place at some point between the `__init__` and the `execute` methods of the operator, and is handled by the framework\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/186049878/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/186051194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1027#issuecomment-186051194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1027","id":186051194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjA1MTE5NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T04:51:11Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T04:51:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Check out the `template_searchpath` attribute of the DAG object.\nhttp://pythonhosted.org/airflow/code.html#airflow.models.DAG\n\nYou can also pass sql as a string to the operator.\n\nAnother shortcut option is `airflow.utils.readfile` which doesn't do much but is a clean shortcut that will take a fullpath.\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/master/airflow/utils.py#L414\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/186051194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/186051554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/914#issuecomment-186051554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/914","id":186051554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjA1MTU1NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T04:54:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T04:54:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"But why depends_on_past of something that can be skipped?

Airflow was developed as a solution for ETL needs. In the ETL world, you typically summarize data. So, if I wanted to summarize data for `2016-02-19`, I would do it at `2016-02-20 midnight GMT`, which would be right after all data for `2016-02-19` was available.\n\nWhen you did a backfill, you probably did `airflow backfill dummy -s 2016-01-01 -e 2016-02-19` -- these are inclusive data boundaries. Hence, the `2016-02-19` data was already generated by your backfill and there was nothing for the scheduler to do when you re-enabled it. \n\nNow, once `2016-02-20` completes, you should see it get summarized. Hence `2016-02-20` will run on `2016-02-21T02:00:00Z`,which is UTC 2am on Feb 21. \n\nThis is what @DinoCow was also saying, I just went into a little more detail. Does this make sense? \n\nIf you wanted to also test this theory, you could have `airflow backfill dummy -s 2016-01-01 -e 2016-02-18` and then turned on your DAG to watch the scheduler execute `2016-02-19`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/186710459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/186775586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1031#issuecomment-186775586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1031","id":186775586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Njc3NTU4Ng==","user":{"login":"davidsbatista","id":7937824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzc4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7937824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista","html_url":"https://github.com/davidsbatista","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidsbatista/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-21T08:40:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-21T09:45:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for both replies.
