I would not encourage us expose this as a primitive as python array, since it can cause problems like mutating argument list of an IR call node.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726770963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726771483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6913#issuecomment-726771483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6913","id":726771483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjc3MTQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T13:42:57Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T13:42:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please check if #6911 resolves the issue","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726771483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/726801407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6889#issuecomment-726801407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6889","id":726801407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjgwMTQwNw==","user":{"login":"ANSHUMAN87","id":32511895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTExODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32511895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87","html_url":"https://github.com/ANSHUMAN87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T14:40:18Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T14:50:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Just to check, you're only transposing the dense matrix?

And if you have time, could you give a breakdown of time spent in the matrix multiply vs time spent in the transpose?\r\n> \r\n> From these numbers, it does look like it is worthwhile to do this.

Generally, it means you have some fatal errors in the code.\r\n> It is very rare to recover from a case where you have so many continuous errors.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely certain what causes us to hit this condition. In our case, we observed from the AutoTvm debug prints that it was due to error_no=4 which is a RUNTIME_DEVICE error (as you can see from the except of AutoTvm log I included previously). Hitting this condition happened very intermittently. We could run a particular op/shape one time and hit the condition and without changing anything it would work the next. In addition, having one op/shape reach this condition didnt mean the rest of our op/shapes that we were running in the same script would fail meaning the system overall was able to recover. I think the main issue is that by terminating the program as soon as we meet this condition we dont allow for the chance to recover and additionally, we wont be getting this useful precise feedback about what error we are hitting while using the auto_scheduler.\r\n\r\nIll do the rebasing and try to fix the CI issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/728307739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/728343498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6854#issuecomment-728343498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6854","id":728343498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODM0MzQ5OA==","user":{"login":"tkonolige","id":1501680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1501680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige","html_url":"https://github.com/tkonolige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T21:36:24Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T21:36:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen This PR is all ready to go.

If your ultimate goal is to lower a Relay function to a TE compute without applying the TOPI schedule, then it looks like we can improve #6903. It currently works like the following:\r\n\r\n- Set `PassContext.config.relay.backend.use_auto_scheduler` to `True`.\r\n- In `compile_engine`, if `PassContext.config.relay.backend.use_auto_scheduler` is `True` and there is no auto_scheduler schedule, then returns an initial schedule (created by `te.create_schedule`).\r\n\r\nTo achieve your goal, maybe we simply set `PassContext.config.relay.backend.use_auto_scheduler` to `True` and directly call `ScheduleGetter` in `TVM_REGISTER_GLOBAL(\"relay.backend._TranslateToTE\")`. In this case, since we don't provide auto_scheduler schedule, you'll just get an initial schedule. In this way, we won't affect any existing flow but just provide another path for getting the TE graph. Then we just need to focus on refining the message such as \"Cannot find a config for ...\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, the name \"translate_to_te\" is misleading to me. First, Relay and TE are not at the same IR level, so \"lower\" would be more proper than \"translate\". Second, if you prefer just provide an API to \"lower a Relay function to a TE compute with an initial schedule\" instead of \"any possbile schedule (i.e., TOPI schedule or auto_scheduler shcedule)\", then this API should be like `lower_to_te_compute` (the initial schedule is just the same as the compute); otherwise it should be `lower_to_te(func, schedule=[initial, autotvm, auto_scheduler])`.\r\n\r\ncc @zhiics @merrymercy \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/729878479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/729888380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6888#issuecomment-729888380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6888","id":729888380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTg4ODM4MA==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-18T19:00:09Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T19:00:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that just having a default schedule be produced is one such workaround (and it's actually the initial workaround I used).

requires creation of a lot of LLVM objects. If we can use LLVM's target mechanism to know the endian of the target machine, perhaps it is better to do byteswaping by ourselves. Alternatively, we can simply only switch on bits, but not types.\r\n\r\nE.g. use uint32 for both float32, int32, and uint32 array.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/731762607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/731827304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6946#issuecomment-731827304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6946","id":731827304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTgyNzMwNA==","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-22T19:24:08Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T19:24:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@FrozenGene comments are addressed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/731827304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
