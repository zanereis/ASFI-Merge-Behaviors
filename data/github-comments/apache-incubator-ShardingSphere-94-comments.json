It seems this class becomes much better. Your contribution made this class become more clear, not as ugly as ever. Althought more optimization could be done, one point concerns me much is the name of some rules, like `CreateDefinitionClause_`.\r\n\r\nOur instruction tells us `CreateDefinitionClause` is standard one, since we visited it in our `Visitor.class`, so i suggest to review any rule name ending with `_` in `MySQLDDLVisitor.java`.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see your another PR concerning this.
