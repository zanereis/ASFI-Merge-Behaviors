It could be easier to do unit test.\r\n\r\n> I am aware on how to build the entire project but I want to just run the tests in this file to check.\r\n\r\nYou could run `ReflectionUtilTest` on IDE, right click mouse and select `Run ReflectionUtilTest` on context menu (Intellij IDEA for example), refer to [Run tests]( https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/performing-tests.html ) for more details.\r\nAnd also you could run `ReflectionUtilTest` via Maven on Shell, with `-Dtest=\"xxx.ReflectionUtilTest\"` option, refer to [Running a Single Test]( https://maven.apache.org/plugins-archives/maven-surefire-plugin-2.12.4/examples/single-test.html ) for more details.\r\nTry any of them, run on IDE should be more
