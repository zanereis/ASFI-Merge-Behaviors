I was able to uninstall the brew installed version (wish I would have realized brew could install it first!), but I still have opencv installed through the process I followed here: http://blogs.wcode.org/2014/10/howto-install-build-and-use-opencv-macosx-10-10/ The files are located in my usr/local/lib folder and I'm not quite sure how to properly uninstall them. It appears that Xcode now only comes with SDK10.11 which is the the underlying cause of the incompatibility (since I pointed to this SDK in Cmake and I'm using OS 10.10.5). When I try to simply delete the opencv files in my usr/local/lib folder and then use brew to install opencv, I get this\n[this.txt](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/files/44124/output2.txt) error running make -j4.
