the `Running->NotRunning` in `KafkaStreams` is not easy/possible. To recap, ideally for a clean shutdown we have `Running->PendingShutdown->NotRunning.`\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n\r\n- in the case when an exception happens in a thread (assume just 1 thread in total) AND the unhandled exception handler does NOT call `streams.close()` then all the threads are `DEAD` and the instance transitions from `Running->NotRunning`. There is `PENDING_SHUTDOWN` in the middle since no one called `close()`.\r\n\r\nThis could be classified as a bug in our logic. If all streams threads are DEAD, maybe our own code should call close()?
