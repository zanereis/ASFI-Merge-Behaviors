I partially amend my comment. The first part, changing:\r\n\r\n```if (isKeyValueSeparatorChar(c) && !isCharEscaped(line, i) && !isCharEscaped(line, i-1)) ```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```if (isKeyValueSeparatorChar(c) &&  !isCharEscaped(line, i-1))```\r\n\r\nis correct. The middle case is redundant since `isKeyValueSeparatorChar(c)` where `c = line.charAt(i)` means the character at `i` is \"=\" and certainly not \"\\\".\r\n\r\nFor the second part, `(!isCharEscaped(line, i) || !isCharEscaped(line, i-1) `, this fails the test for \"Tru\\\\th=Beauty\" = \"Truth\", which still doesn't look right to me but my \"fix\" doesn't solve the problem either. Specifically, I feel that backslashes should be allowed in the key (and possibly other escape sequences), but this is harder than I originally thought. (A project for another day).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I do feel my observation that the middle case in the first conditional is redundant is worth fixing. I withdraw the second change though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/823424307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/835118981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/268#issuecomment-835118981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/268","id":835118981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTExODk4MQ==","user":{"login":"fpapon","id":6915443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTU0NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6915443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon","html_url":"https://github.com/fpapon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpapon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-08T05:44:19Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T05:44:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bdemers

Then I made a few POM changes, not expecting the build result to change, it was simply meant to be a clean-up. But to my own surprise, my [commit](https://github.com/kriegaex/shiro/commit/e5d16ede5aa9f3d11d1097a725ac60ecbbd7d5ec) fixed the [CI build](https://github.com/kriegaex/shiro/actions/runs/970094680).
