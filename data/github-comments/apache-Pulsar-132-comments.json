If they do so, they are incompatible with Surefire and you should probably file an issue with the library/vendor. Alternatively the forked VM could also have crashed for a number of reasons. Look for the classical \"hs_err*\" files indicating VM crashes or examine the Maven log output when the tests execute. Some \"extraordinary\" output from crashing processes may be dumped to the console/log. If this happens on a CI environment and only after it runs for some time, there is a fair chance your test suite is leaking some kind of OS-level resource that makes things worse at every run. Regular OS-level monitoring tools may give you some indication.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo is there any ways to reduce the phenomenon?\r\n\r\n@sijie

from my view, it is better to unsub the topic first, then do a clean topic delete, instead of delete topic by force. user could get all the subscriptions information from topics stats/stats-internal.

This is not in the scope of \"regex subscription\", even a consumer that subscribed on a dedicated topic will also re-create topic once it is deleted. If user don't want to see the topic again, he need first un-sub all consumers, and close all
