Thanks for pointing this out üòÉüôè\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I feel this particular change to the object system might be a bit aggressive, given in TVM nullability by default is allowed by design, and enforcing nullptr checks every time might be contradictory with the assumptions in some pre-historic pieces of the codebase (I'm sure there isn't many though).\r\n\r\nJust wanted to share some recent efforts on improving nullability related stuff:\r\n\r\n- This RFC introduces the not-nullable macro `TVM_DEFINE_NOTNULLABLE_OBJECT_REF_METHODS`. If an ObjectRef type `T` is marked using this not-nullable macro, then our system will check its nullability to ensure security, unless it is explicitly guarded using `Optional<T>`; Converting `Optional<T>` to `T` incurs nullability checks as well so it's safe;\r\n- We have several follow-up PRs that migrates many TVM types to not-nullable, so checks are on by default for those types: #5654, #5717, #5748, #5788;\r\n\r\nHowever, the effort was paused because the support is not perfect for composite TVM objects, i.e. TVM objects that contain other TVM objects, and it's less prioritized task given it only helps with adversarially constructed cases, we haven't seen too much progress on this side.\r\n\r\nI am happy to chat more if you are interested!

I think they are only useful in some extreme and rare security cases, e.g., some hostile server attack to model servers using tvm. \r\n\r\nAs you said, a more fundamental and elegant workaround would be applying `Optional`, though I found it needs to change countless legacy codebase (e.g., changing many APIs into `Optional<T>` and convert them into `.value()` style). This PR is like a quick fix avoiding most crash issues by such tricky inputs (since the root cause of most issues is that applying data access (`->`) through nullptr). And it only considers avoiding bad inputs from Python API.\r\n\r\nSince the conclusion seems to be clear (I know you guys are busy and such issues are minor and should not be prioritized), I think we can close this PR and simply record this proposal on the channel.

I think the status maybe is still not stable. @kparzysz-quic should give more definitive answer","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/917932363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/917938536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8682#issuecomment-917938536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8682","id":917938536,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42tqFo","user":{"login":"deeply","id":3132183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzIxODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3132183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply","html_url":"https://github.com/deeply","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeply/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-13T08:00:31Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T08:00:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Seems that llvm-13 has already changed the signature of `llvm::Intrinsic::getName` in the latest [rc2](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-13.0.0-rc2/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Intrinsics.h#L68).

Now that @mbs-octoml has articulated the `tec::` and `./` changes, that seems in line with the purpose of this PR. However, I'd suggest the commit history should not show that removing memory planning was the last change to the issue templates, the microTVM Arduino port, Ethos U, Vitis AI and Relay docs.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR seems to have inadvertently reverted https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8973?\r\n\r\nI'd propose integrating @mbs-octoml's comments and then scoping the commit to just `src/relay` for final review?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/919579720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/919592128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9012#issuecomment-919592128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9012","id":919592128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42z9zA","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T23:58:24Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T23:58:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@huajsj
