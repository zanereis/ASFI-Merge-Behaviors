This removes any compile dependencies to log4j and replaces them with compile dependencies to slf4j and runtime dependencies on logback.  Jobs, Forks, and Tasks now add the job name, job id, and task id to slf4j MDC.  To facilitate this information flowing correctly across threads, Callable and Runnable have been replaced with GobblinCallable and GobblinRunnable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/217334108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/217336194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/967#issuecomment-217336194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/967","id":217336194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzMzNjE5NA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T02:47:26Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T02:48:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/6070712/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/6070712)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.2%) to 45.163% when pulling **564884833045e6f4920a691772ba00281df3273a on kadaan:SwitchToLogback** into **588d8c77fe3c84c752fd410f916868419c178465 on linkedin:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/217336194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/217348929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/957#issuecomment-217348929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/957","id":217348929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzM0ODkyOQ==","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T05:03:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T05:03:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sahilTakiar updated.
