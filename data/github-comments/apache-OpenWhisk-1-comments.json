The actions needs to tell the invoker which version of node it wants to use, hence which image it needs to use to start the container (that's the field you described). This is needed regardless of any implementation details, right?\n2. Invoker pulls the appropriate image, which it does by the naming scheme proposed by myself.\n\nIn fact, there would be another possibility to the second step:\nWe could install multiple node versions into the NodeJSAction container and use something like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to choose the right version on runtime. \nThat'll be a single more bloated image vs. one image for each node version.\n\n**Note:**\nInstead of using another parameter to the action code itself, npm supports [**engine** requirements](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines). This could be an option aswell (in the future maybe).\n\n**Edit:**\nWhile this issue is related to node only, we need to take other runtimes into account as well. One might want to use a different version of everything. Since it might not be too easy to implement a \"multi-version all-in-one\" image there, I'ld vote for the \"one image per version\" approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/188357839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/188778875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/17#issuecomment-188778875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/17","id":188778875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODc3ODg3NQ==","user":{"login":"vinodmut","id":770084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T13:07:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T13:07:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this related more broadly to the runtime environment in addition to the runtime version?\n\nFor example, not just Python 3, but a Python 3 \"data science\" environment that would come with NumPy, SciPy, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/188778875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/188947363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/13#issuecomment-188947363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/13","id":188947363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODk0NzM2Mw==","user":{"login":"vinodmut","id":770084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodmut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T19:41:32Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T19:41:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis CI is configured to schedule a build for every commit and pull request.

It does not work like  \"tail\" showing all the logs from all activations as they happen. Rather it logs an activation ID and its logs when it completes. and in this case there is proper grouping.\n\nWhat is weird is that in the output I pasted this is not happening and you can see several \"Activation: name (id)\" lines without logs in between and I think I found why:\n\nConsider this badly written action where the calls to whisk.done/async are commented\n\n```\nfunction main(args) {\n  var sleepFor = Math.random() * 5000;\n  //console.log(\"Sleeping for\", sleepFor);\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    console.log(\"done!\");\n    //whisk.done(undefined, null);\n  }, sleepFor);\n  //return whisk.async();\n}\n```\n\ncreate the action\n\n```\nwsk action create bad badaction.js\n```\n\nenable the poll\n\n```\nwsk activation poll\n```\n\nsubmit a bunch of them\n\n```\nfor i in `seq 1 10`; do wsk action invoke bad& done\n```\n\nthis is the output I got:\n\n```\nActivation: bad (c075e249d7a345b2b0dbfeed02f74b85)\n2016-03-01T14:37:18.006337633Z stdout: done!\n2016-03-01T14:37:18.217177728Z stdout: done!\nActivation: bad (e2651fa6418b4eefac2ceb13dcf95f65)\nActivation: bad (8ce77bbe3b924e8fa1c16f8013205a2f)\nActivation: bad (b18975147da54e33beaab2dbefb86b6d)\nActivation: bad (aa12e7be019a4e43803d207c3bc4daa4)\nActivation: bad (ef44bf7df80b47658b832180b902dd5d)\nActivation: bad (52a66d13771d49d4950b51b401b6ef13)\nActivation: bad (318ac51e01a04c5ebaf732707e71422c)\n2016-03-01T14:37:19.159226693Z stdout: done!\nActivation: bad (29857d67deec4d9d829b5d5dff0c2123)\nActivation: bad (7fea504493ea4ecca581edc2a55c777e)\n```\n\nnow if I send some more:\n\n```\nActivation: bad (a4edaa3a08634e24b245099856d60cd8)\n2016-03-01T14:38:48.656056548Z stdout: done!\n2016-03-01T14:38:48.656137681Z stdout: done!\n2016-03-01T14:38:48.656232864Z stdout: done!\n2016-03-01T14:38:48.656302012Z stdout: done!\n2016-03-01T14:38:48.656391177Z stdout: done!\n2016-03-01T14:38:48.656984195Z stdout: done!\n```\n\nand I think that is what happened in the logs I put at the beginning of this ticket.
