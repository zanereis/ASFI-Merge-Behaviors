\r\n\r\nGenerally, I think currently the dev follows these conventions:\r\n+ When make a big feature or a long term fix of some bug, work a new branch. \r\n+ When make a rapid fix of some issue tweaks someing, work on `master` branch or `release` branch. If making new branch in this case, it is probably inconvenient and makes the commit log full of \"merge\".\r\n\r\nAnd about the case #9774 , which blocks the `npm i`, that is infrequent (might be only 1 in the latest year). But it can be prevented by auto CI.\r\n\r\nIn previous practice, we did not pay enough attention to keep the `master` stable. It should be improved, following the principle that the `master` should always be able to \"build\" and run \"basically\" normally. I use \"basically\" because that the overall test only happens in the \"release stage\", where some more bug brought by the lastest commit can finally be exposed. But it is not easy to prevent all of those bugs from merging into `master` at the \"dev
