we can get bytecode instrumentation feature of pinpoint along zipkin`s rich scala libraries support, it would be great.\r\n\r\n> By running your own JVM, you have abilities beyond normal.

I am not quite expert on distributed tracing than you. So if I am wrong, kindly correct me.\r\n\r\nTo introduce distributed tracing, we may need followings.\r\nIn abstraction, we need interceptor which intercepts normal remote call and manipulate/transport some information such as span in-between the call. Accordingly, we need to initialize the interceptor, and keep the context for each remote call. But these procedures should be manually done in code level.\r\nThat means, OW core codes such as controller, invoker should be changed in some level. We may use wrapper for libraries such as akka-http which is provided in zipkin in some cases.\r\n\r\nWith bytecode instrumentation, above procedures will be done by framework. Framework will insert above logics automatically at class loading time. Ideally no code changes on core modules are required. But for libraries, if there is no available plugin for libraries, we may need to implement new one to apply bytecode instrumentation on library code.\r\n\r\nSo if we can use pinpoint along with zipkin, it would be the best.\r\nAFAIK, zipkin already has many libraries support such as akka-http. If we use bytecode instrumentation of pinpoint, there would be \"ideally\" no code changes on core modules and be able to take the power of rich library supports with zipkin.\r\n\r\nBut at first I have no idea on integration of both framework, I preferred pinpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/298486330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/298493927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2192#issuecomment-298493927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2192","id":298493927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ5MzkyNw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T04:20:32Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T05:34:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If you are unable to control the libraries OpenWhisk uses, and there is an\r\nagent that somehow does, probably sounds like you should do what you\r\nprefer, which is to use an agent.

In this way who wants to print to disk and consume disk I/O can do it, and who wants to send those markers into zipkin, could in theory do this; or both. By reusing the [transactionId](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/common/scala/src/main/scala/whisk/common/Logging.scala#L102)  as the parent SpanID, we could build a simple 1 level hierarchy  and log those markers.
