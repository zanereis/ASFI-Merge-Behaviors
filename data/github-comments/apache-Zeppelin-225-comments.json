@maziyarpanahi\r\n\r\nZeppelin is quite complex and I agree that the documentation is not very useful.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I would like to get rid of the apache/zeppelin docker image as it is not really suitable for K8s.\r\n\r\nI envision the following process:\r\nAutomatically build the [zeppelin-distribution image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/Dockerfile).\r\nThen build both the [zeppelin-server image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/scripts/docker/zeppelin-server/Dockerfile) and the [zeppelin-interpreter

Hello @maziyarpanahi\r\n> \r\n> Zeppelin is quite complex and I agree that the documentation is not very useful.\r\n> \r\n> On the whole, I would like to get rid of the apache/zeppelin docker image as it is not really suitable for K8s.\r\n> \r\n> I envision the following process: Automatically build the [zeppelin-distribution image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/Dockerfile). Then build both the [zeppelin-server image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/scripts/docker/zeppelin-server/Dockerfile) and the [zeppelin-interpreter image](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/scripts/docker/zeppelin-interpreter/Dockerfile) on top of it.\r\n> \r\n> Can you perhaps perform the process as an outsider and adjust the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nHi @Reamer \r\n\r\nYes, I will follow these steps to \r\n- build custom images for `server` and `interpreter` based on `zeppelin-distribution image`\r\n- download the default `zeppelin-server.yaml`\r\n- change the images for the server and interpreter to point to these custom local images\r\n\r\nI'll share the process here before we decide how to update the docs to reflect these steps.
