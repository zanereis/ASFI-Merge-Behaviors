This provider should try all ports form the widest possible range, e.g. all ports that are not well-known.\n2) Fail only if the second provider returns nothing.\n\nThe rationale behind this approach  is that there might be something wrong with the first tcpPortProvider - such as too narrow port range - or  there might exist some temporary weird contention in the underlying OS.\n\nHowever, I don't know how to correctly create the second provider within a Tang-injectable constructor.

Which means that it shares the network connection with all other processes (containers) on that same box. If you now configure ports statically and two of your containers end up on the same host, only the first will be able to bind to that port. The second container will fail, as the port is already taken.\n\nThe common way around this is to use `0` as the port number. That signals to the OS to pick any of the available ports.\n\nHowever, we ran into issues with that approach on clusters with two levels of firewalls: The one of the OS, but also an outer one (e.g. on the host if the OS is virtualized). In that case, the OS has no idea of the external firewall configuration and will happily open a port that will be blocked by the outer firewall. In order to overcome this, we've added the `TcpPortProvider` mechanism: It returns available ports to whomever needs them and can be configured by the user for the cluster at hand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/155834454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
