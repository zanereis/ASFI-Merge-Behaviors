I vote for `16`, it has proven to provide great performance, ~1s running time for querying 30k running task states( of course this also heavily depends on the network, celery broker, backend etc, we use redis for broker and backend), and is not a crazy number that will create much burden on the box.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/419695750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/419697228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3868#issuecomment-419697228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3868","id":419697228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTY5NzIyOA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-09T07:43:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-09T07:43:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3868?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#3868](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3868?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/7cd3a8546964db4ba99fca6cf91a6b38c85d4e3c?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3868/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3868?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #3868   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   77.51%   77.51%           \n=======================================\n  Files         200      200           \n  Lines       15815    15815           \n=======================================\n  Hits        12259    12259           \n  Misses       3556     3556\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3868?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3868?src=pr&el=footer).
