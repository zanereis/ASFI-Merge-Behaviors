For the parser part, I think we can start by directly checking alpha equivalence of the graph as well as potentially the comparison to a simulated FP32 version.\r\n\r\n+ @anijain2305 \r\n@tqchen most of the code for mxnet qnn has been tested for MKLDNN. Some of the formulas used for quantization, dequantization and convolutions used my the reference Mxnet implementations(fake quantization) is not fully and thorougly tested. Also some of the optimizations available in MKLDNN are not implemented in the stock implementaion. So, my suggestion to unblock this PR would be to use the simple feed forward network test case, where we test only the graph generated by QNN. Once we have the fix from MKLDNN as well we can add proper test cases with MKLDNN at that time.\r\n@tqchen and @icemelon9 what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581189877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581216205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4747#issuecomment-581216205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4747","id":581216205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTIxNjIwNQ==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-03T02:54:20Z","updated_at":"2020-02-03T02:54:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@yidawang Would you like to review it again?

subcommand failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update1:   \r\nOK, it seems `clang` by default only supports C++98 standard and C++11 is not enabled by default! and this error is caused becasue of this!  \r\nalso, llvm repo on github includes the clang compiler, unlike the sources from llvm.org which has separate source for each one!    \r\nI'm going to build directly from the llvm github repo and see how  things go. if God wills, it will all turn out OK! \r\nI'll update what happens then!\r\n\r\n### Update 2:   \r\nDo not compile with clang! as it does not support c++11! in windows, compile with mvc(microsoft visual c++ compiler). the catch here is , to set LLVM_DIR to the directory where llvm.cmake exists. \r\nthat is, when you downloaded and extracted the llvm source (no need for the clan by the way), navigate to \r\n```bash\r\nllvm-9.0.1.src/lib/cmake/llvm/\r\n```\r\nand you'll find the  mentioned file, so basically add this to the `config.cmake` \r\n```cmake\r\nset(USE_LLVM ON)\r\n# instead of my path, use yours obviously! \r\nset(LLVM_DIR D:/Codes/tvm_testbed/tools/llvm-9.0.1.src.tar/llvm-9.0.1.src/lib/cmake/llvm/)\r\n```\r\nthen continue building. you can read more [here

However, the things become different when we have asymmetric padding support. If we pass 4D padding (top, left, bottom, right) directly to QNN, if we are in the target of CPU, we will call\r\n```python\r\ndef helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization\r\n```\r\nif we don't have int8 acceleration. there isn't pad handling here.\r\n\r\nThe logic of QNN is always do like `Conv2DPadInput`. This is not perfect way because we will always have `pad` operator before QNN. We should have `pad_const` and let the tvm backend to handle pad value.\r\n\r\nI prefer this PR make FP32 be  asymmetric padding and leave QNN padding support as previous way (i.e. inserting `nn.pad` in tflite frontend). However, I wish we could add one attribute `pad_const` to `Conv2DAttr` and related api to support asymmetric padding computation of QNN.

Mxnet suggests to use MKLDNN as backend for quantization. The operators for MKLDNN quantization in Mxnet is different from stock Mxnet quantization operators. Also, for some ops the implementation of these ops are also different.\r\nDue to this PR #4753 and #4764, it is not possible to merge the Mxnet-MKLDNN installation in TVM docker. One potential solution is to test stock quantization operators but that would be extra work that may not be too useful in future. All the testing we have done and the edge cases we have covered are for the MKLDNN operators.\r\nMy suggestion is at this point we check in the parser code along with the the test scripts we have for benchmarking the QNN networks.

Mxnet suggests to use MKLDNN as backend for quantization. The operators for MKLDNN quantization in Mxnet is different from stock Mxnet quantization operators. Also, for some ops the implementation of these ops are also different.\r\n> Due to this PR #4753 and #4764, it is not possible to merge the Mxnet-MKLDNN installation in TVM docker. One potential solution is to test stock quantization operators but that would be extra work that may not be too useful in future. All the testing we have done and the edge cases we have covered are for the MKLDNN operators.\r\n> My suggestion is at this point we check in the parser code along with the the test scripts we have for benchmarking the QNN networks. When MKLDNN issues are fixed and we can safely upgrade we can add test cases at that point.\r\n\r\nI am OK with this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581800500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581887507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4771#issuecomment-581887507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4771","id":581887507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTg4NzUwNw==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-04T12:26:22Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T12:26:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've done a big clean up + simplified the code a bit and added some comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581887507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581966405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4798#issuecomment-581966405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4798","id":581966405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTk2NjQwNQ==","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-04T15:33:50Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T15:33:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM, possible to have a test?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581966405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/581995303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4809#issuecomment-581995303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4809","id":581995303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTk5NTMwMw==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-04T16:30:51Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T16:30:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":" fyi I have the same fix in #4756 as part of pillow update.
