I've had a number of clients that would benefit from this sort of capability. My one big question/concern is whether or not this new reader will be tolerant of poorly formatted or inconsistent documents. As an example, one of the things I've seen over the years is people doing stuff like inserting arbitrary values at various points of the spreadsheet. Comments, stuff like that. Will this reader be flexible enough to ignore junk and badly formatted stuff or will it just fail on contact with such data? IMHO, to be genuinely useful it would need to have a flexible mode and a strict mode so that people could make at least a \"best effort\" at extracting data.\r\n\r\n(I haven't actually dug into the PR, so just asking some high level questions.

I suspect if not, then PM is not displayed in the Excel spreadsheet as it would be in an English speaking locale. Hence there would be no column to match the 'TIME:HH:mm:ss a'  format ('a' matches AM/PM) as there is on my box which is an English speaking locale. I did some quick research and it appears by default Excel displays dates based on regional settings.\r\nA quick fix to solve this issue would be to change the time pattern which is being searched for. Currently it is 'HH:mm:ss a'. I suggest using  'HH:mm:ss.SSS' so the fields which have PM in them '12:00:00 PM' and '12:00 PM' will not be inferred on the CI servers where PM is not be present since neither of them have milliseconds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1526041161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1526060605","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7194#issuecomment-1526060605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7194","id":1526060605,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5a9dY9","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T17:19:10Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T17:19:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

It is actually dependent on the java.util.Locale and not the operating system. In order to use the org.apache.nifi.util.SchemaInferenceUtil.getDataType method for inferring the correct data type, I needed to get the cell value as a string. To do that I used [ apache.poi.ss.usermodel.DataFormatter](apache.poi.ss.usermodel.DataFormatter) which I hoped would take care of any formatting and give the best inference possible, especially if the cell value was a timestamp or perhaps a big integer. It is only now I realize that class is heavily reliant on java.util.Locale which determines how numbers and dates are formatted in a given locale. Hence the difference across the CI builds which are running in different locales.  The particular  field which has the differences is a field with a number in scientific notation. In FR it is represented for example as 9,8765E+08 while the other locales represent it as 9.8765E+08. The underlying NIFI code which parses numbers does not recognize commas or spaces as part of a legitimate number, hence it is inferring the field's data type as a string in the FR locale and not as a float. This may point to an incorrect assumption made by org.apache.nifi.util.SchemaInferenceUtil.getDataType. It is interesting to note org.apache.nifi.csv.TestCSVSchemaInference side steps this issue by only dealing with integer numbers.\r\nI still believe the choice I made for the inference logic is correct as the POI handles all of the necessary formatting. Though it seems  I probably should use simpler data for the unit testing which would work across all locales. Also we should probably add documentation to advise users to be locale aware when using this inference strategy. Please let me know how you would like me to proceed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1527776319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1528095567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7194#issuecomment-1528095567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7194","id":1528095567,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5bFONP","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-28T21:06:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T21:06:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I simplified the unit tests to avoid any  locale issues (much like org.apache.nifi.csv.TestCSVSchemaInference).

The putdatabaserecord have disabled autocommit feature so you cannot even use it with Trino or Dremio.\r\n The only way, which is not recommended is to use putsql process that needs some pre-processing steps before sending the data to Trinio or Dremio.\r\nI have opened a ticket on Jira ([Ticket-11449](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11449))hopefully someone will consider it.\r\n\r\nHope this helps you.\r\nRegards","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1551567048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
