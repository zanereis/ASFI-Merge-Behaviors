If I were to make `safeDouble` always return true, would any tests fail?\r\n> \r\n> If I wrote\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> boolean safeBoolean(boolean b) {\r\n>   return b == true || b == false;\r\n> }\r\n>

But I don't see how `safeDouble` is any different, because you've already dealt with inf and -inf. Maybe you just need to check for NaN. `java.lang.Double` has methods for that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThe answer to your first question is yes. Following BQ behavior, multiplying two non-infinite numbers whose result is > ~1.7e308 (or exceeds the bounds in any way) should return `NULL`. However, if either operand is infinite, the result should not be `NULL`. To match this, I check if either number is +/- inf, and then continue accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor example, `(+inf * 1)` and `(1.7e308 * 2)` should return different results (the first: `+inf`, the second: `NULL`) despite the fact that Java would tell you the answer to both is `+inf`.\r\n\r\nYou are right though that I need to address `NaN`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1625641445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1625671896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3234#issuecomment-1625671896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3234","id":1625671896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5g5cjY","user":{"login":"tanclary","id":116591231,"node_id":"U_kgDOBvMKfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116591231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary","html_url":"https://github.com/tanclary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanclary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-07T16:40:05Z","updated_at":"2023-07-07T16:40:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zoudan @julianhyde I modified the checks s.t. if either operand is non-finite (infinite or NaN), the result should be returned.

Additionally, there is currently an exception that gets thrown from `validateColumnListParams` if we just use `SqlBasicFunction.create` instead. The `#deriveType` override avoids this.

Is the behavior for the other dialects correct? I would imagine so but on the off chance it's not, we could avoid adding a whole extra operator.

In fact, the current `SameOperandTypeChecker` allows character and numeric to exist at the same time. It's just that `inferReturnType` does not handle the simultaneous existence of character and numeric. please see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static final SqlFunction ARRAY =\r\n      SqlBasicFunction.create(\"ARRAY\",\r\n          SqlLibraryOperators::arrayReturnType,\r\n          OperandTypes.SAME_VARIADIC);\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/bdfb17029f7e205f895dc3dfd0f37c8ff2520823/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql/type/SameOperandTypeChecker.java#L92\r\n\r\nThe `SameOperandTypeChecker` will handle the special case of character, which itself allows character and numeric to coexist.\r\n\r\nso currently run `select array(1, 2, 'Hi');` can pass the OperandTypeChecker but with NPE in return type checker. This pr is used to fix the inconsistent behavior of operandTypeChecker and returnTypeInference.
