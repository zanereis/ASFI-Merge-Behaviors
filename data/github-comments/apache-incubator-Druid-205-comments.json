IMO we need to clear that out. is it really true that every record is part of a partition and has a sequence number?\r\n\r\nI haven't read the patch yet, but I think it is useful to have an abstraction for ordered-partitionable streams (like Kafka and Kinesis have). It's because we have a lot of logic specifically around dealing with those kinds of systems when it comes to partition discovery, task creation, work assignment, and metadata handling. A lot of that shared code won't apply if the streams do not have an ordered-partition concept.\r\n\r\nIt seems like Pulsar topics are ordered-partitionable (they can have partitions, and those partitions have messages with ordered sequence IDs) so it should be able to fall under the same abstraction.

thanks for the comments. The motivation for creating the SeekableStream abstraction is for seekable order partition-able streams, like Kafka and Kinesis, I should have been more specific in the pr description and naming the classes. \r\n\r\n~~Regarding Pulsar, after digging into the docs for a bit, it seems that Pulsar is [partition-able](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-messaging/#partitioned-topics), but does not guarantee ordering within the partitions when [shared subscription mode](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-messaging/#subscription-modes) is used on the consumer side. So I think Pulsar and other systems like it do not fit the characteristics / share enough similarities with Kafka/Kinesis indexing service to be grouped under the same abstraction.~~\r\n\r\nSeems like Pulsar supports partitions and offer strict ordering within each partition if failover subscription mode is used, so it should fit into the current abstraction.\r\n\r\nAs for the `Record` class, it should probably be named something like `OrderedPartitionableRecord` as its purpose was not to serve as a generic record for any streaming task. The reason why it contains an order list of `List<byte[]> data` is because in our current Kafka supervisor implementation, a record's value is an array of bytes, as in `IncrementalPublishingKafkaIndexTaskRunner`\r\n```java\r\nfinal byte[] valueBytes = record.value();\r\nfinal List<InputRow> rows = valueBytes == null\r\n        ? Utils.nullableListOf((InputRow) null)\r\n        : parser.parseBatch(ByteBuffer.wrap(valueBytes));\r\n```\r\nand in `KinesisRecordSupplier`, when `deaggregate` is configured, `UserRecord.deaggregate()` returns a `List<UserRecord>`, which, is likely to maintain the order in which the messages were inputted into the aggregator\r\n```java\r\nif (deaggregate) {\r\n    data = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n    final List<UserRecord> userRecords = UserRecord.deaggregate(Collections.singletonList(kinesisRecord));\r\n    for (UserRecord userRecord : userRecords) {\r\n          data.add(toByteArray(userRecord.getData()));\r\n    }\r\n} else {\r\n    data = Collections.singletonList(toByteArray(kinesisRecord.getData()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI agree that `<T1, T2>` should be changed to something more descriptive like `<partitionType, sequenceType>`\r\n\r\nI will update the pr description to include more details, and address the code reviews individually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/428273955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/428276237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6437#issuecomment-428276237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6437","id":428276237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODI3NjIzNw==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T17:17:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T17:17:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/428276237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/428277266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6427#issuecomment-428277266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6427","id":428277266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODI3NzI2Ng==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T17:20:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T17:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@QiuMM is there any docs fixup as well?
