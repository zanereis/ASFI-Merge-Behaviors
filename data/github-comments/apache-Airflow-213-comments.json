I tested it now extensively on Linux and the main problem was that when you tried to map local source folder to the container, you could not easily map it as \"airflow\" user and the folders are not accesible to airflow user.\r\n\r\nThis is a known Docker problem (there is an open issue for that https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/2259 ). I looked at possible workaround, but it turns out, until this issue is solved, it's easiest if airflow is run as root (then everything is root-owned inside the container).\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur on Mac because on Mac local volumes are mounted to virtual machine using user-space synchronising filesystem via virtual machine (which makes it much slower on one hand, but it allows to carry the user mapping with the bind volume). But if someone develops on Linux that could be a huge blocker for convenient development environment. \r\n\r\nI hope this is something that you will be able to live with :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478016580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478020135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4932#issuecomment-478020135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4932","id":478020135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODAyMDEzNQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-29T14:34:48Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T14:34:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ashb @fokko -> I pushed latest version that is much improved:\r\n\r\n* mysql installation is now simplified, no more server-specific configuration (thanks @ashb for the hint)\r\n* parameters for the database are now spread across various docker-compose files. I found it easiest to have separate compose file for each database and \"compose\" the files when running - so for example when you run it locally you compose : docker-compose.yml + docker-compose-postgres.yml + docker-compose-local.yml (the last one adds source bind mounts for local development). \r\n\r\nIt's nicely modular but you might not like it. so if you don't let me know (and why) - I might try to find another solution.\r\n\r\nAlso after @ashb hangout I've decided to implement a small improvement in the 'run-test' script - now the database is initialized only the first time you run test in the container, subsequent times the database is not initialized (unless you specify --with-db-init switch). This is a nice automation for the pattern you explained in your hangout, where you mentioned you rarely use run_unit_tests.sh because database initialisation is slow. With the approach I suggest, you do not have to copy&paste things but can run the tests with the scripts. Combined with auto-complete, I think it's really helpful (especially to onboard new people). \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478020135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478023542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5002#issuecomment-478023542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5002","id":478023542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODAyMzU0Mg==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-29T14:43:43Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T14:43:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CC: @potiuk","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478023542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/478024877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4992#issuecomment-478024877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4992","id":478024877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODAyNDg3Nw==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-29T14:47:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T14:47:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @saurabh3091  was this closed by accident?
