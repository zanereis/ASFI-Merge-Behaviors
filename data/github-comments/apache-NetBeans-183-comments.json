And it does not do that, because it uses the Eclipse JDT underneath. And that, too, added support recently. So, the RH JLS will take a little time to upgrade. That is when I found the Netbeans one. \r\n\r\nI have always loved the Netbeans Project management built around Maven. I assumed that it will use the underlying JDK for the syntax highlighting too. I don't care too much about the time, or CPU, it takes (with incremental builds). But more about the accuracy of the build, and a single source of truth for the settings (pom.xml ).\r\n\r\nI had to move off Netbeans a lot of years back when STS was the norm for all Spring development in VMware. Looks like I have been out of touch with Netbeans for a really long time now.\r\n\r\nAlways itched to start using it again. With the VS Code Dev Container revolution, I am a \"believer\" that I do not need to install any compilers / runtimes on my machine. That way, I can switch in and out of dev environments / OS / local-remote without any trouble. So, going back to the Netbeans local dev environment is no longer a choice. And the Netbeans JLS is a welcome addition.\r\n\r\nI see that Netbeans 20 does not release until mid-November. Hoping I can start using Java21 before that, via RH.

Explicit archives are not permitted with CDI Lite.  The new default value for the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute in CDI 4.0 is changed from `all `to `annotated`.  `annotated` is also used when an empty `beans.xml` file is discovered during deployment.  This would imply implicit bean archives are now the expected default.\r\n\r\nFrom CDI Full: [https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0#bean_archive_full](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0#bean_archive_full)\r\n\r\n> An explicit bean archive is an archive which contains a beans.xml file with bean-discovery-mode of all.\r\n> \r\n> An implicit bean archive is:\r\n> \r\n> - an archive which contains a beans.xml file that is empty, or,\r\n> \r\n> - any other archive which contains one or more bean classes with a bean defining annotation as defined in [Bean defining annotations](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0#bean_defining_annotations).\r\n\r\nTo my understanding with CDI 4.0, an empty `beans.xml`, a non-existent `beans.xml`, and a `beans.xml` file with the following content are equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<beans xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee\"\r\n       xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n       xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_4_0.xsd\"\r\n       bean-discovery-mode=\"annotated\"\r\n       version=\"4.0\">\r\n</beans>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the section you referenced from the specification is only referring to portability between CDI Lite and CDI Full implementations to prevent unexpected deployment issues.  \r\n\r\n> Implementations that do not support CDI Full are required to detect presence of an archive which contains a beans.xml file that has bean-discovery-mode attribute set to all and treat it as a deployment problem.\r\n\r\nI know CDI Lite and CDI Full are new in CDI 4.0 - previously there was only the CDI Core.  Jakarta EE application containers are required to implement CDI Full.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not so sure a non-existent beans.xml is an issue here.

Priming is also usually not necessary if the referenced artifacts are already present in local repository ... which is a typical situation on developer's machine that is used to develop a number of projects.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is that headless LSP usage of NB has some initialization paths not well reachable through NetBeans UI. Our colleagues also use 'throwaway' VMs to run the NBLS servers, so some of the scenarios come from using a pristine machine without anyting in .m2 repo -- from the NB IDE point of view, they're testing for our first-time users/adopters. You would be surprised how many things go different if you just run `mvn install` on any project before launching NB :)\r\n\r\nBTW - in some of the later PRs I hope I will be able to avoid running `mvn install` for \"priming\" that includes compiling a potentially broken work-in-progress project (yuck !!) and only download the necessary plugin/jar dependencies as Gradle tooling does during its initial project open. Should be a lot faster and safer.

This could cause additional problem in future, e.g: #6190\r\n\r\nNow it does, it actually runs `mvn install`. But IMHO it's not a good idea, as\r\n1. we need the (internal) project load to succeed and at least resolve all referenced artifacts locally - this is done through embedder\r\n2. we should(!) avoid compiling the project's code \r\n\r\nWe need (1) for parsing, code analysis, location services to work. And (2) prolongs the time, mixes project dev errors (i.e. broken code) with project setup errors (i.e. nonexistent artifact) or environment setup errors (bad network setup, ...)\r\n\r\nMajority of NB operations actually use information extracted from the Embedder, so we need the Embedder to work/be happy in the first place ... and #6190 shows our Embedder is just not configured well enough, at last for some operations.\r\n\r\nAn interesting idea would be to inject a plugin that would report all project info into the buildchain; similar to Gradle support ... but that would prevent NB to resolve queries using Maven libraries at all.

It happens just when you resolve the problem from project problems or (initially) on project open. LSP case primes the projects as they are opened (similar to project open dialog). So no `mvn install` withou user's action.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we need to put the artifacts to a place where our internal Embedder can find them ... and ideally to a place where the external buildchain can find them to avoid duplicate downloads.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1746489459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1746500344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4137#issuecomment-1746500344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4137","id":1746500344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5oGXr4","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T09:34:34Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T09:34:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi I@matthiasblaesing do you think we could merge this PR as well as #4138  ?

That's not compatible. You'd need to replicate the exporting of packages from the OSGi manifest, surely?\r\n\r\nNB bundling third party libs as public API is only asking for trouble in my opinion. e.g see the lucene situation where the editor is stuck at 3.6. since updating that would be likely time consuming (clone the modules, deprecate the old interface etc), while the maven indexer modules which wrap the lib for internal consumption only, can update any time they want with no extra steps.\r\n\r\nI haven't actually checked if the direct or indirect [users](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fnetbeans+%3Ccode-name-base%3Eorg.eclipse.jgit%3C%2Fcode-name-base%3E&type=code) of jgit are exposing the lib in their API, if they do, it would be already too late to hide the lib wrapper.\r\n\r\n> I don't know what other compatibility implications switching from OSGi to NB module here would raise\r\n\r\nanyone is welcome to take over this PR and do the modularization part.

But this is just my 2c - no strong opinion here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1749739714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1750005537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6530#issuecomment-1750005537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6530","id":1750005537,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5oTvch","user":{"login":"itzlewitz","id":71373493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzczNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71373493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz","html_url":"https://github.com/itzlewitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itzlewitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-06T05:28:28Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T05:59:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can be reproduced with any Netbeans version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1750005537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1750093725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6539#issuecomment-1750093725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6539","id":1750093725,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5oUE-d","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-06T07:10:50Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T07:10:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks good to me. license is there and placeholders are gone.

The reported value matched the implementation located in `META-INF/versions/17`.\r\n- **Is the OSGI `Fragment-Host` header support?**: JGit relies on the Fragment-Host header for JSch and OpenPGP support. Both were manually verified.\r\n\r\nThe questions about OSGI integration support for NetBeans are valid though as two limitations were found and had to be fixed:\r\n\r\n- The parsing of the `Fragment-Host` header did not account for bundle specifications with version constraints. To fix this the code already used when parsing the `Export-Package` was also applied for the `Fragment-Host`.\r\n- JGit declares a dependency on the runtime java version via the `Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment` header. This is checked against the list of values present in `org.osgi.framework.executionenvironment` by the OSGI runtime. This value was basicly fixed on the one matching JDK 8 in Equinox. To support later JDKs the value of `org.osgi.framework.executionenvironment` is now calculated by the NetBinox infrastructure before the OSGI framework is initialized.\r\n\r\n@jtulach I think you are best qualified to review the OSGI/NetBinox changes. Could you please have a look at d32a76e785757b0c3382a120be90550f00a3b1bb and 7ff7e8787f4a932d5d5902dbe6b38645dfa7755f?\r\n\r\nWith regard to https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4439 we need to implement an CredentialsProvider, that dispatches display/querying of data to Swing and integrates with the NetBeans KeyRing. The GitCommand subclasses need to be modified to set that provider. I injected a test implementation that returned a hard coded passphrase and that enabled me to create a signed commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1751970782/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1751975684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6541#issuecomment-1751975684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6541","id":1751975684,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5obQcE","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-08T09:29:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-08T09:51:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"as mentioned in https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6541#issuecomment-1751681361 the closing bracket is only a problem if it stands alone in the line.
