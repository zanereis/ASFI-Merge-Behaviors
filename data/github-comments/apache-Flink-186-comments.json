There are two problems in yarn cluster mode:    \r\n1、when we use the keytab，we do not set the HDFS delegation token to yarn container context, but yarn need.\r\n2、when we user keytab, and also get  HDFS delegation token. The UGI contains both, but UGI use token first to communication with HDFS. The default expire time of HDFS delegation token is 7 days. Flink does not refresh the token.\r\nSo, I resolve this problem by following solution:\r\n1、we user keytab and also get HDFS delegation token.  The token is set to yarn container context. And the UGI only use keytab. \r\nMaybe the best solution I think the AM need refresh the token like spark.

Once `JobManagerRunner` granting leadership, it will check the job status by `RunningJobsRegistry`. If the job is already running, then the `JobManager` will enter reconciling process and confirm leadership last.\r\nTo do so, we can confirm that the `TaskManager` will not report task status before `JobManager` reconciles, and it is also reasonable for 'JobManager` exposing its address to outside `TaskManager` after internal initialization. To keep the behavior consistency, I modified the `EmbeddedLeaderService` to set leader flag as true in the process of `grantLeadership` instead of 'confirmLeadership`.\r\n\r\n2. 'ExecutionGraph' recovery based on task status report form `TaskManager`, and I created the new execution attempt to replace the current one for recovery, also the same case for `IntermediateResultPartition` to avoid updating the final fields directly in previous way. And also integrating two phases of recovery into one phase you mentioned before.\r\n\r\n3. After duration time, the `ExecutionGraph` decides to enter `RUNNING` or `FAILING` from `RECONCILING` based on reconciliation results.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have not considered the improvements for `LAZY_FROM_SOURCES` schedule mode in this version, because it needs to remember how many vertexes have already been scheduled before `JobManager` failure. Maybe we can improve it in next version if needed.\r\n\r\nI may supplement some extra tests and update the attached design doc after you approve this realization, and the 'TaskManager' part will be submitted in another separate PR which mainly includes:\r\n\r\n1. `TaskManager` will not fail task directly after notified of `JobManager` leader lost, and triggers a timer to later check whether reconnects to the new job leader successfully.\r\n\r\n2.

thanks for the contribution.  I think I understand the problem and your solution, which I will recap.  I also found YARN-2704 to be useful background.\r\n\r\n*Problem*:\r\n1. YARN log aggregation depends on an HDFS delegation token, which it obtains from container token storage not from the UGI.  In keytab mode, the Flink client doesn't upload any delegation tokens, causing log aggregation to fail.\r\n2. The Flink cluster doesn't renew delegation tokens.  Note: Flink does renew _Kerberos tickets_ using the keytab.\r\n3. When the UGI contains both a delegation token and a Kerberos ticket, the delegation token is preferred.   After expiration, Flink does not fallback to using the ticket.\r\n\r\n*Solution*:\r\n1. Change Flink client to upload delegation tokens.  Addresses problem 1.\r\n2. Change Flink cluster to filter out the HDFS delegation token from the tokens loaded from storage when populating the UGI.  Addresses problem 3.\r\n3. Change JM to propagate its stored tokens to the TM, rather than the tokens from the UGI (which were filtered in (2).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/304369701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/304393222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3992#issuecomment-304393222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3992","id":304393222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDM5MzIyMg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-26T21:36:12Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T22:04:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@greghogan I've fixed all the issues you found. ~~I don't know what to do about the checkstyle disabling though using `//CHECKSTYLE.OFF: ConstantNameCheck|`.

In fact, this is a similar interface clean-up issue as FLINK-6457 that we want to solve. But certainly, we can just merge this to master and include this in the next release.\r\n\r\nJincheng, yes, it is one's flavor about how to implement an interface with contracted method. From my point of view:\r\n1. A contract method is usually to be very useful as a flag to indicate the characteristic of an aggregator, and this information will help the optimizer to decide the plan. Such methods are retract/merge/resetAccumulator.\r\n2. I prefer we should just expose the user interface without any default implementation (an interface method with default implementation will anyway not control the user behavior). The user defined interface IMO should purely ask users to provide minimum required methods that can let the UDX work. \r\n3. We will call getAccumulatorType and getResultType also during the compilation to generate the plan I think. If we put requiresOver into the interface, we should also consider to put getAccumulatorType and getResultType into interface as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we may want to provide all the agg that requiresOver as the built-in agg in the future. Thereby, we may not need to expose this interface in the UDAGG at that point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/304420971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/304429261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3776#issuecomment-304429261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3776","id":304429261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDQyOTI2MQ==","user":{"login":"Rucongzhang","id":13606366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA2MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13606366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/Rucongzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-27T05:32:02Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T05:32:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@EronWright ，thank you very much . yes you are right.

If we choose the contract function design, we have the same default behavior as the default implementation if the method is not implemented, so IMO there is not really a difference. Due to the default implementation, a user does not need to implement the method unless it is necessary. However in that case, it can be overridden in a safe way with IDE support. A contract function, does not offer this safety because a user needs to lookup the exact signature in the documentation.\r\nAd 3) I think it would indeed make sense to add `getAccumulatorType()` and `getResultType()` to `AggregateFunction` and return `null` by default. This would also be more consistent with `ScalarFunction` and `TableFunction`.

**I once again seriously consider the Refactoring work, according to the following principles updated the PR.**\r\n\r\n   **First, the test type and purpose(4 types):**\r\n* Unit Test: to ensure the correctness of the most granular features\r\n* StringExpression Test: Verify the consistency of java and scalaAPI\r\n* Validation Test: Check the API exception information\r\n* Integration Test: Integration testing, verifying runtime and end-to-end correctness\r\n\r\n   **Second, the directory structure(folders) and purpose:**\r\n  \r\n    The TEST directory contains all the paths (folders) of the SRC directory - the functional tests included three type test case (**Unit Test**, **StringExpression Test**,**Validation Test**)\r\n   **Note:** runtime directory contains both runtime (**Unit Test**, **StringExpression Test**,**Validation Test**), and All table API/SQL **Integration Test**.\r\n\r\n   **Third, the file name naming convention:**\r\n* Unit Test -> functionName + **Test**\r\n* StringExpression Test -> functionName + **StringExpressionTest**\r\n* Validation Test -> functionName + **ValidationTest**\r\n* Integration Test -> FunctionName + **ITCase**\r\n\r\n**After the change
