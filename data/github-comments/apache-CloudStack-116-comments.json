seeing some issues with this PR, related to the way the VR scripts utilize the argv file name for other uses. We spent a fair bit of time trying to run down a problem with static routes not being hot plugged. The odd thing was, a failover to the backup, or a restart of the network brought up the static routes fine (after applying your static route failover PR - thanks for that!).\n\nI think the problem is in the way /opt/cloud/bin/update_config.py calls out to configure.main, that in turn calls the individual process classes:\n\n```\ndef finish_config():\n    # Converge\n    returncode = configure.main(sys.argv)\n    sys.exit(returncode)\n```\n\nsys.argv here, happens in this PRs case to be static_routes.json.[GUID]. \n\nIn configure.py, def main(argv) relies on the argv to be the actual json file payload from /etc/cloudstack/, or in the case where you want to configure every service, you just specify cmd_line.json. In our case, what we see is that /etc/cloudstack/static_routes.json gets correctly replaced with the valid data, but the configure method never calls out to CsStaticRoutes here:\n\n```\n    if process_file in [\"cmd_line.json\", \"static_routes.json\"]:\n        logging.debug(\"Configuring static routes\")\n        static_routes = CsStaticRoutes(\"staticroutes\", config)\n        static_routes.process()\n```\n\nI took a look at this in Cosmic last night and I didn't see any additional code within the systemvm scripts to handle this differently, so this may also be an issue in Cosmic.\n\nI would suspect, this pretty much affects the hot-plugging of any new configuration.\n\nI've learnt a lot about how horrible the VR scripts are in this adventure and honestly I think the community needs to work on not just cleaning these up, but making them more bulletproof in general. \n\nI hope this points you in the right direction.\n- Si\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/218446038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/218456049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1532#issuecomment-218456049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1532","id":218456049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODQ1NjA0OQ==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T13:17:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T13:17:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you sir.
