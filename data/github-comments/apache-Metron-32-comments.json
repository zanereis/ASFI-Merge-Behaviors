From a 'how metron works' point of view, this change does not change what the system does in an observable way, it retains the status quo ante functionality.  So that test plan is not different than another change that says \"run up in full dev and verify that that topologies are running etc....\".  That being said, I will list it out in more detail.  I apologize for the vagueness.    The other point of view, which I think you are referencing is \"as a metron developer, who may have to add a new parser to metron proper\".  This **is** different from before, but was also not documented in the old architecture either, which is why I didn't take a stab at the dev guide in this PR.  We also do not have guides for adding new ambari services, adding components to the rpm, creating new ambari scripts as well, all things I had to reverse and figure out to get this working, and we did not hold up those efforts to wait for them, so I did not think it was required.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that I don't agree such things should exist, and maybe should have been required then and be required now.

It is not a reflection on your work, but rather a desire to make sure that work gets appropriate consideration.  Your work is very much appreciated.

Please rebase so it can be done.  Since the one file you changed has not been touched by recent commits, the rebase should be painless.  If you're not familiar with git rebase, ping me offline.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding of Justin's PR is correct, you can then just layer on his bf8ce62 patch, and have a good start on testability.  @justinleet is that correct?

It parses and evaluates Stellar expressions, with caching of the parse, and with given context (variables), variableResolver, and functionResolver.  It can return any Stellar data type.  It also provides a validate() method.\r\n\r\nThe \"stateful\" executor, org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarStatefulExecutor, assists with Aggregators, where state needs to persist across multiple invocations of the same entity, and in fact was formerly located at org.apache.metron.profiler.stellar.StellarExecutor.  It was renamed when I relocated it, to avoid conflict with the Shell executor, org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.StellarExecutor, which is significantly different.  I deemed the stateful executor to be Stellar functionality rather than Profiler, and moved it.  The Aggregator functions will also be moved into Stellar, but that will be in Step 3, which will be a different PR.\r\n\r\nI agree in future it would be nice to have design documents, for Stellar and other parts of Metron.\r\n\r\n> I think the readme should be \\[expanded into a Language Reference Manual :-) \\]\r\n> ...maybe it should be added to the follow on list.\r\n\r\nYah, that would be good.  I've opened [METRON-998](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-998), as a follow-on task.\r\n\r\n> I think that this could be a feature branch.\r\n\r\nSince this started as a regular PR, I'd like to finish this one that way.  But I agree, before starting Part 3 I'll petition to create a feature branch for the next set(s) of work.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/308900462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/308914488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/616#issuecomment-308914488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/616","id":308914488,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODkxNDQ4OA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T02:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T02:17:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Matt, I think your write up above should be captured somewhere...
