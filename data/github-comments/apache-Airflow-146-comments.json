Similar applies to a separate `replace_rows` method.\r\n\r\nAfter some deeper look into the code, one way to solve that would be splitting out the sql string generation process into two separate methods (one for insert and one for replace, with the latter raising `NotImplementedError` in `dbapi_hook`), and overiding those in the engine specific classes.

From my limited understanding of front end stuff, the apps actually serving traffic live in [the gunicron workers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/bin/cli.py#L882). After the subprocess are created, [cached_app() will be called to create one app per subprocess](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/bin/cli.py#L832). Since security_manager.sync_roles() lives in create_app(), we should be able to resync the roles/perms everytime we restart the subprocess( not the webserver). Meanwhile, [the workers will be restarted every web_server_worker_timeout](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/bin/cli.py#L812), thus we can refresh both DagBag and roles/perms w/o restarting the master webserver process.\r\n\r\nIf what I stated is just misunderstanding, I would still strongly suggest we find a way to remove this line--either extract only the needed logic or start the subprocess earlier or something like that. The current approach scales very bad and does not make any sense to me( we're waiting for 2 complete app constructions including 2 single process DagBag parsing before the webserver can serve traffic, at least with the current scale of Airbnb means ~28mins to start a webserver--for around 2k DAG files including some complicated framework DAG files).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/398649747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/398656111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3517#issuecomment-398656111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3517","id":398656111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODY1NjExMQ==","user":{"login":"flokli","id":183879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli","html_url":"https://github.com/flokli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flokli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T07:44:57Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T07:44:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, `dbapi.run` and `dbapi.insert_rows` already share a lot of code, with the only part missing being the `commit_every` feature.
