You'd better try it, and to see whether or not.\n\n**## Extension: Mutliple Labels for a Single Image**\n\n> The im2rec tool and mx.io.ImageRecordIter also has a mutli-label support for a single image. Assume you have 4 labels for a single image, you can take the following steps to utilize the RecordIO tools.\n> Write the the image list files as follows:\n\n`integer_image_index \\t label_1 \\t label_2 \\t label_3 \\t label_4 \\t path_to_image`\n\n> When use im2rec tools, add a ‘label_width=4’ to the command argument, e.g.\n\n`./bin/im2rec image.lst image_root_dir output.bin resize=256 label_width=4`\n\n> In your iterator generation code, set label_width=4 and path_imglist=<<The PATH TO YOUR image.lst>>, e.g.\n\n```\ndataiter = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(\n  path_imgrec=\"data/cifar/train.rec\",\n  data_shape=(3,28,28),\n  path_imglist=\"data/cifar/image.lst\",\n  label_width=4\n)\n```\n\n> Then you’re all set for a multi-label image iterator.\n\nThis
