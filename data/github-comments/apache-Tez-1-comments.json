The design doc in 3997 was meant to provide the big picture and as the place to collect feedback for the overall design. We believe suitable level of details about proposed changes have been provided, and it would be great hear from community on the design.\r\n\r\n2. The feature was broken into 4 tasks carefully that range from basic support and plugin addition(3998), api change in AM component (3999), change in runtime (4000) and more complete scenario support (4001). We believe such break-down is suitable for us as new contributors to fit in, beginning with a simple change discussed here (3998) that is standalone in itself. We are hoping that our changes will take a gradual path to completion, which would not necessitate a separate feature branch.\r\n\r\n3. In the change introduced here, the SilentEdgeManager is indeed a stub, that is by design and would not likely to change. However, I would not categorize the other change (such as the new VertexManagerWithConcurrentInput) as so, since it is functional as it is and we have added UT coverage to cover that as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/comments/430452231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/comments/431344565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tez/pull/33#issuecomment-431344565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/33","id":431344565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTM0NDU2NQ==","user":{"login":"yingdachen","id":5042027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDIwMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5042027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen","html_url":"https://github.com/yingdachen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yingdachen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T12:21:04Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T12:21:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jteagles thanks for your input.\r\n\r\nRegarding the implication of RM(YARN) supporting gang scheduling, it largely depends on how application/runtime is implemented, and may not be an absolute necessity.  While it would be best if strong gang-scheduling can be guaranteed by RM, but even when without, AM can still assist in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. AM can schedule all tasks in upstream and downstream vertices simultaneously, as is implemented in this change\r\n2. AM can gather information about downstream/upstream tasks and inform dependent tasks to put things into action only when all dependencies are satisfied. This will require mechanisms such as waiting/timeout/retry to be implemented in application runtime, but that would be something needed anyways, even with RM gang-scheduling.  Some of the changes along this line would be covered by TEZ-4000.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/comments/431344565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/comments/431493613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tez/pull/33#issuecomment-431493613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tez/issues/33","id":431493613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTQ5MzYxMw==","user":{"login":"jteagles","id":8976028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzYwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8976028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles","html_url":"https://github.com/jteagles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jteagles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T20:44:43Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T20:44:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yingdachen, a few other considerations. 1)Normally, a feature like this could be a candidate for feature branch.
