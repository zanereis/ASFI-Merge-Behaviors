In that case, how are you choosing the values and what assumptions are you making when choosing them? I'm not 100% opposed to adding these knobs if they are necessary, but want to understand whether they really are.\r\n\r\nAlso, perhaps does the overload of JdbcIO.ConnectionConfiguration.create(DataSource) work for you, where you specify your parameters on the DataSource manually?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/290186369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/290186735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2193#issuecomment-290186735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2193","id":290186735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDE4NjczNQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-29T18:44:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T18:44:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

you for these very elaborate explanations. I don't think I have a specific use case where it would be different from the defaults. As said, I'm not very familiar with Beam and JDBC in general. From my background (Web and Ruby), I know that sometimes tuning the connection pool size can greatly improve throughput and I was surprised to find no options. That being said your explanation totally makes sense to me, so I will report back when I'd find such use case (but probably won't!)
