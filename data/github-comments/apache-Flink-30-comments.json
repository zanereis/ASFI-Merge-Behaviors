@vasia, \n\nI had a look at the new branch. The changes look good, degrees are no longer exposed to the user and the current approach removes the need to subclass Vertex. :+1: \n\nThe only small remark/comment I have comes from a user perspective: \n- let's say that, by mistake, I forgot to set the degrees option;\n- let's also say I was too \"busy\" to read the manual :)\n- result: I will get -1 instead of the expected number of degrees per vertex\n\nI understand why you had to pass -1 there; it should be of the same type as the degrees. However, maybe we can come up with some way to hint users that they should not forget to set the corresponding options.  Adding an extra line in the documentation might not suffice.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/101978637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/101981739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/308#issuecomment-101981739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/308","id":101981739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTk4MTczOQ==","user":{"login":"FelixNeutatz","id":5217389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTczODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5217389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz","html_url":"https://github.com/FelixNeutatz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-14T09:21:26Z","updated_at":"2015-05-14T09:21:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, what is the final decision here?\n\n>  this seems like a lot of code for something that can be achieved using a simple mapper\n\n--> that is exactly the reason why I would want this functionality - it is too much code for a simple thing :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/101981739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/101989242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/649#issuecomment-101989242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/649","id":101989242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTk4OTI0Mg==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-14T09:58:22Z","updated_at":"2015-05-14T09:58:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joey001, \n\nHow did you rebase this?

Right now, we have some named `xyzExample` like `GSAConnectedComponentsExample` and others without \"Example\" in the end, like `GSAPageRank`. I personally don't like \"Example\" in the end, because it makes class names unnecessarily long (we already know they're examples since they're in the respective package).\nFor the ones that don't use a library method, this is no problem. For the ones that use a library method and we have a collision. I guess we have two choices: (a) keep the word \"Example\" for the ones using a library method or (b) renaming the library methods to something like `xzyAlgorithm`.\n\nAny other ideas?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/102373199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/102374179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/635#issuecomment-102374179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/635","id":102374179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjM3NDE3OQ==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T11:29:09Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T11:29:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks good!

Should we tie it strictly to a session, meaning it has to be initialized with a `JobID`, or lazily pick up the session. What happens if you submit a JobGraph that comes from a different session? Does it track multiple sessions then?\n- If the `Client` manages remote sessions, it should be created on the first use of the remote executor, and then be kept.\n- The `LocalExecutor` used in the `LocalExecutionEnvironment` should probably allow you to maintain sessions as well. It would need to be started on the first execution and stopped when the environment terminates the session or runs out of scope.\n- I think it makes a lot of sense to automatically terminate sessions as soon as the environment or the executor runs out of scope (becomes finalizable or garbage

However, if that's the common by behavior of parses in the Java world, I'm not going to insist on the current behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/103122448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/103135620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/683#issuecomment-103135620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/683","id":103135620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzEzNTYyMA==","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-18T17:09:37Z","updated_at":"2015-05-18T17:09:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks all, merging ...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/103135620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/103178282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/684#issuecomment-103178282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/684","id":103178282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzE3ODI4Mg==","user":{"login":"ggevay","id":11377925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11377925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay","html_url":"https://github.com/ggevay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-18T19:07:13Z","updated_at":"2015-05-18T19:07:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for your comments.\n\n@rmetzger:\nWe will discuss creating the Jira issues with @mbalassi.\n\nI fixed the catching of the IllegalAccessException.\n\nThe assertions seem to be enabled for the unit tests.
