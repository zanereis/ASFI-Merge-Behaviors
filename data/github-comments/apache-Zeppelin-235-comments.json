Therefore, I considered using Docker, but the current Docker thrift image has been deprecated since [version 0.12.0](https://hub.docker.com/_/thrift), and there is no support for the current version, 0.13.0. \r\n\r\nHowever, through @Reamer's review, I found an alternative approach by exploring the thrift-related code here: https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/hbase-thrift/pom.xml\r\n\r\nLooking at this code, instead of supporting the installation directly, we could consider an approach where we simply check if thrift is installed and proceed only if it is. This method could reduce the build burden for users who don't have thrift installed while maintaining build consistency for those who do. \r\nHowever, this approach might only be feasible because, in the example above, the thrift code is separated into its own module.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2324856504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2326082673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4802#issuecomment-2326082673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4802","id":2326082673,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM6KpTRx","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-03T09:47:22Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T09:47:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"As

\r\nIt seems like it could depend on the situation.\r\nIn my opinion, if the resource URLs are set as fixed absolute paths, there could be an issue, but if they are relative paths, there shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nIn the initial code I wrote, I added code on the server side to insert a `base` tag into the `index.html` at runtime.\r\nHowver, when I ran the app and checked the network tab, resources were being fetched from the correct paths even without the `base` tag, so I removed it.\r\n\r\nFrom reviewing the frontend code, my assumption is that most of the resources are set with relative paths, or they dynamically generate absolute paths based on each app's path, so there didn't seem to be an issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, upon reconsideration, I thought explicitly specifying the `base` tag would be a more reliable soltuion, so I added the code back

In my opinion, both the attempt with `sudo` and `ssh` are hacked solutions.\r\nIn general, there are such approaches that the running program changes the user. This can be seen, for example, with the Apache web server, which changes from `root` to `www-data`. As far as I know, this is done because Apache opens privileged ports (<1024). In the case of Apache, this is usually 80 or 443.\r\nZeppelin is already running on a high port e.g. 8080, so it is not necessary to change the user here, but you can start directly with an unprivileged user.\r\n\r\nBoth ssh and sudo may have problems passing signals to the JVM. This can lead to the Zeppelin interpreter not shutting down properly.\r\n\r\nI had the signal problem in K8s, which is why I switched to `exec`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2360732927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2360736386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4835#issuecomment-2360736386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4835","id":2360736386,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM6MtfqC","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-19T11:32:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T11:32:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If the user impersonation works again with these corrections, that's fine by me.
