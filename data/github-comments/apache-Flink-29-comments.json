I do :), it's just not possible. \n\nKeep in mind that in the VertexUpdateFunction and in the MessagingFunction you can only access the vertex in the updateVertex() and sendMessages() methods. \n\ngetDirection(), getBroadcastSet() return a single value for all the vertices. getDegree() returns one  value for each of the vertices. As previously implied, you cannot access the vertex in these classes. The only very ugly solution is to give it the entire DataSet and to constantly filter it. You basically have the degree of the vertex in the Tuple3, but this information is hidden from the user. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/99232613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/99427464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/654#issuecomment-99427464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/654","id":99427464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5NDI3NDY0","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-06T12:15:07Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T12:15:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would change the setName() method to name() to match the batch api, but other than this it looks good to merge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/99427464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/99427925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/654#issuecomment-99427925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/654","id":99427925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5NDI3OTI1","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-06T12:17:59Z","updated_at":"2015-05-06T12:17:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, will rename while merging -

Do those methods works in pairs?\n\nThe way we call sources in Flink streaming is a bit broken, thats why we are reworking it right now. Thats the pull request where we change it: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/659\nBut you are right, open() and close() work in pairs. Connections we are opening in the open() method should be closed in close().\nI would leave that for now as it is, because we are going to change that in the next days anyways.\n\n> do you think it is a good idea to assign the client to null after stopping it in the closeConnection method, so it can be garbage collected as soon as possible? Also, if closeConnection() throws an exception, isRunning never changes to false.\n\nYes, you can set it to null.\n\n> we should check for preconditions in the constructors and public set methods to avoid receiving null auth propeties or similar cases.\n> we could have a private constructor that receives all the possible parameters and use constructor chaining to avoid code duplication even in the constructors.\n\nThese are both very good ideas!\n\n> I have created a util file to place methods when working with properties files, i put the load method that loads a properties object form a file path, we should place this in a more common package, i put it close to the file i have changed but we should consider moving it to a better place.\n\nMaybe we can combine it with this one: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/664\n\n> Separate the different connectors into different submodules.\n\nThere is already a JIRA filed for this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1874\nBut I would suggest to wait for a few days until https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/659 is merged, otherwise, there are going to be a lot of merge conflicts.\n\nIn general: Feel free to change whatever is necessary to make the code better (also the missing javadocs). Your suggestions are all very good. I see that you have a good sense of writing high quality code!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/100902145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/100917520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/664#issuecomment-100917520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/664","id":100917520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDkxNzUyMA==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-11T14:01:04Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T14:01:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > If this tool also supported positional arguments ...\n> \n> I also though about adding those, but decided against it, because args[n] is already a way of > accessing the arguments by their position ;)\n> But I'll add it so that users can also specify default values .. and we take care of the parsing.\n\nI'm not so sure about this anymore.

This pull request does a at least two very big things at the same time:\n- Move iteration synchronization to the JobManager\n- Unify aggregators and accumulators into one.\n\nWith all the example / testcase adjustments, this becomes a lot to review. The description of the pull request also does not make it easy, since many questions and decisions that arise are not explained:\n- What interface do the unified aggregators/accumulators follow: The aggregators, or the accumulators.\n- How is the blocking superstep synchronization currently done. With actor ask?\n- How is the aggregator/accumulator unification achieved, when aggregators are created per superstep, and accumulators once?\n\nThis is a lot for a very delicate and critical mechanism. I think if we want to merge this, we would need more details on how things were changed (what is the concept behind the changed, not just what are the code diffs).\nWe may need to break it into multiple self-contained changes that we can individually review and merge, to make sure that it gets properly checked and will work robustly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/100996059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/100999172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/660#issuecomment-100999172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/660","id":100999172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDk5OTE3Mg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-11T17:58:56Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T17:58:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems to contain a second fix, to skip static fields in data types.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/100999172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/101000540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/660#issuecomment-101000540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/660","id":101000540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTAwMDU0MA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-11T18:02:46Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T18:02:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does the Scala API not treat Java classes the same way as its own classes?\nThat sounds absolutely like the right thing to do.
