this is ready for review. thank you. \r\n\r\nTo note a few\r\n- `hudi-spark/src/test/java/HoodieJavaApp.java` and `hudi-spark/src/test/java/HoodieJavaStreamingApp.java` are for docker run and integ tests hence leave them as is.\r\n- hudi-spark module is supposed to have package name `org.apache.hudi.spark` but it is `org.apache.hudi`. I'm not inclined to change it in this PR as this involves changing the src/main packages too. Hence I only aligned the test package with the src not changing both.\r\n- `hudi-utilities/src/test/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/inline/fs/TestParquetInLining.java` is an outlier in `hudi-utilities` as its docs explained, it was supposed to be in `hudi-common` but needs HoodieTestDataGenerator which is in `hudi-client` hence it was placed in `hudi-utilities`. I left it as it due to this needing changes to `HoodieTestDataGenerator` in a bigger scope.\r\n\r\nThese are the points that not reflected in the diff. Let me know if you have different views. cc @vinothchandar

Glue catalog does not currently support **cascade** for **alter table** statements. We discussed this internally before, and @bschell has started looking into this issue. The most probable solution as of now seems to be to run alter command for each partition in case of glue catalog. However, he is still investigating further. I noticed there was no JIRA for this issue so I created one https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-874.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/626417498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/626420797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1542#issuecomment-626420797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1542","id":626420797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjQyMDc5Nw==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-11T01:07:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T01:07:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi @bvaradar, the unit test `TestCleaner#testCleanPreviousCorruptedCleanFiles` has covered.
