Hi, thanks for your pr. In my opinion, your pr is a great enhancement for sharding-spring-boot, but now sharding-spring is an independent sub-project as [sharding-spring](https://github.com/sharding-sphere/sharding-spring), so can you create a new pr for [sharding-spring](https://github.com/sharding-sphere/sharding-spring) with the detail of this pr?\r\n\r\nIn addtion, my suggestion for this pr are as follows:\r\n*  Please extract a new function to get `dataSourceList`\r\n*  Instead of creating two classes of`SpringBootShardingInlineTest` and `SpringBootMasterSlaveInlineTest`, can you move `assertWithShardingDataSource()` to `SpringBootShardingTest` and move `assertWithMasterSlaveDataSource()` to`SpringBootMasterSlaveTest`? Of cource, they need new function names.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/448163219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/448173322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1581#issuecomment-448173322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1581","id":448173322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODE3MzMyMg==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-18T10:29:56Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T10:29:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This
