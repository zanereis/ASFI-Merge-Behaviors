Sorry if I had not been clear enough.\nAs I wrote previously, I see 2 options to handle this:\n\n1/ Check null _object_, and do not render the src tag. This will lead the image to not show at all (well, at least FF works like that)\n\n``` java\nprotected void buildSrcAttribute(final ComponentTag tag, IModel<?> srcModel)\n{\n    if (srcModel.getObject() != null)\n    {\n        tag.put(\"src\", srcModel.getObject().toString());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2/ use `String#valueOf`. This will lead to the src tag to have null value and display a broken image, which can also make sense to alert without throwing a runtime NPE...\n\n``` java\nprotected void buildSrcAttribute(final ComponentTag tag, IModel<?> srcModel)\n{\n    tag.put(\"src\", String.valueOf(srcModel.getObject()));\n}\n```\n\nI have a slight preference for the 2nd choice. I guess you will opt for the first choice; so if everyone is fine with this first choice, that's fine for me too!

I split every measurement into a single class so that you can decide much better what you want to measure and what you don't want to.\n\nIn addition I added a guide how to define own metric aspects in the guide.\n\nThe last thing I've done is to move it to experimental and fixed the artifact id to be *wicket8 instead of *wicket7 - Is this project automatically released with wicket 8 core?\n\nI also added a template so that you can see what to define if you want to have all stuff. Just open a resource in your ide called \"wicket-metrics.template.xml\" if you have added the maven dependency.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/196422828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/197423520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/164#issuecomment-197423520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/164","id":197423520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzQyMzUyMA==","user":{"login":"klopfdreh","id":980773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDc3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh","html_url":"https://github.com/klopfdreh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klopfdreh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T16:57:49Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T16:57:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Integrated\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/197423520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/200720718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/165#issuecomment-200720718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/165","id":200720718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDcyMDcxOA==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T07:59:26Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T07:59:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@geof379
