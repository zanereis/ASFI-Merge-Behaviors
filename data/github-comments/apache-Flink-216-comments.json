This is the message:\r\n```\r\nFlink comes with bundled Hadoop dependencies in\r\nlib/flink-shaded-hadoop2-uber-*.jar. Flink can also use the Hadoop jars\r\nthat are available on the system (from the distro, EMR, GCE, ...) and\r\nFlink can run completely without Hadoop dependencies. Switching between\r\nthese comes down to either adding or removing the bundled jar from lib/\r\nand/or telling Flink to use the system Hadoop classpaths or not.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a new possible configuration file in\r\n\"bin/hadoop-classpath\". If present, this should contain a classpath\r\ndefinition. When the file is present Flink will append this to the\r\ninternal classpaths.\r\n\r\nThe new configuration script allows easily switching the different modes:\r\n\r\n- use-system-hadoop: Try and determine the system Hadoop classpaths and\r\nstore them in bin/hadoop-classpath. The file can be tweaked manually\r\nafterwards. Move the bundled Hadoop jar from lib/ to opt/ if present so\r\nthat Flink doesn't use it.\r\n\r\n- use-bundled-hadoop: Remove the bin/hadoop-classpath configuration\r\nfile. Move the bundled Hadoop jar from opt/ to lib/ if it is not\r\nalready in lib/\r\n\r\n- no-hadoop: Remove the bin/hadoop-classpath configuration and move the\r\nbundled Hadoop jar from lib/ to opt/.\r\n\r\nFlink will still add this to the classpath in config.sh:\r\n\r\n\"${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}:${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}:${YARN_CONF_DIR}:${HBASE_CONF_DIR}\"\r\n\r\ni.e. env variables on the system are still being picked up, no matter\r\nthe configuration in bin/hadoop-classpath.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat last part is interesting. We've always done it but now I'm wondering whether we should.

Life gets very confusing there if the back end has things like a linux FS and you are using windows. Even worse: if you are using an older version of the hadoop JARs than your cluster, so your `core-default.xml` is out of date.  Only submit the changed stuff. Note that a competent admin will have tagged really sensitive properties (max memory allocations & things) as `final` so you can't override them even if you tried.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/341179176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/341186505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4927#issuecomment-341186505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4927","id":341186505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTE4NjUwNQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T17:54:08Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T17:54:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol I like the changes!\r\n\r\nLast two points:\r\n  1.

This means that we either have to properly set up the classpath to rely on the the default resources or to also look for the `yarn-site.xml` in `HadoopUtils.getHadoopConfiguration`. At the moment we do a mixture of both. `yarn-site.xml` is supposed to be on the classpath while the `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` can also be found if that's not the case. Maybe we should add the explicit loading of `yarn-site.xml` to `HadoopUtils.getHadoopConfiguration` to make it consistent or not using `getHadoopConfiguration` to load the `HdfsConfiguration`.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the user who reported this issue seems to be related to meddling around with the `yarn.application.classpath` in such a way that it no longer contains the hadoop configuration
