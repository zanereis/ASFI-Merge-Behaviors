@alfonsonishikawa Hi, I took a look of HBase metadata analyzer https://github.com/apache/gora/blob/master/gora-hbase/src/main/java/org/apache/gora/hbase/store/HBaseStoreMetadataAnalyzer.java I there are two methods to be implemented:\r\n> getTablesNames and getTableInfo.\r\n> \r\n> getTablesNames is just a list of the tables\r\n> and getTableInfo is a list of the columns of a table\r\n> \r\n> is it correct?\r\n\r\nIt is correct but that is specific for HBase.\r\n\r\nThe first method, `getTablesNames` is needed for the type of mapping HBase has in the tag `<table>`. The signature for this method returns `List<String>` because I expected all datastores to have some \"table\" defined in their mappings.\r\n\r\nThe second method, `getTableInfo` returns specific data of the table and for HBase is an instance of `HBaseTableMetadata`, so in Ignite should be something like `IgniteTableMetadata`. The class IgniteTableMetadata that you have to create should have the needed information you can recover from the native store to help creating the mapping for that table.\r\n\r\nThe rule of thumb is that `IgniteTableMetadata` should return metadata about a table in Ignite. In the case of HBase are things called \"Column Families\", but that is absolutely related to HBase, not Ignite.\r\n\r\nIt could be, columns and types of each column, for example. Or columns, type, sizes, etc...\r\nAs I see from https://github.com/apache/gora/blob/master/gora-ignite/src/test/resources/gora-ignite-mapping.xml it looks Ignite needs the column name and it's type. So, that should be the minimum metadata returned in a (still not implemented) IgniteTableMetadata.java\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/718234821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/comments/718235012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gora/pull/228#issuecomment-718235012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gora/issues/228","id":718235012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODIzNTAxMg==","user":{"login":"alfonsonishikawa","id":3150071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTAwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3150071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa","html_url":"https://github.com/alfonsonishikawa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfonsonishikawa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T22:03:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T22:03:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh!
