After the tasks finish, I still have 10 processes since the daemon's pool of forked processes remain alive.  These processes aren't terribly expensive, since they just sit idle while waiting to `accept()` on the shared listening socket, but they're unnecessary.\n\nAfter applying this patch, I see a peak of 5 Python processes running, one for the python driver, one for `daemon.py`, and three for the workers, and only the driver and daemon remain running after the tasks finish.\n\nThis patch may have broken task cancellation; I'd appreciate help in designing a regression test suite that checks for timely shutdown of Python workers when jobs are cancelled.  I'm considering an approach where we do something similar to this `sleep()` test in order to avoid races between workers completing and the job being cancelled.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50712114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50712207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1147#issuecomment-50712207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1147","id":50712207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzEyMjA3","user":{"login":"chenghao-intel","id":2367031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2367031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T04:47:21Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T04:47:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've updated the code by rebasing the latest master, this PR will greatly improve the outer join performance for big tables.

Anand, \n This looks like a very nice effort !, It would be very convenient if you can break this pull request into smaller subtasks. \n  For example upgrading akka can be one subtask, and so on. That way it is easier for us to review/test and then merge. If however you think that you will not have the time for that I am happy to do it for you ? We would like to have this pretty soon - breaking up the PR will make reviewing and testing really easy for us. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50718152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50718425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1678#issuecomment-50718425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1678","id":50718425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzE4NDI1","user":{"login":"aarondav","id":1400247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDAyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav","html_url":"https://github.com/aarondav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aarondav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T06:31:14Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T06:31:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins, retest this please.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50718425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50718557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1256#issuecomment-50718557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1256","id":50718557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzE4NTU3","user":{"login":"witgo","id":302879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo","html_url":"https://github.com/witgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T06:32:16Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T06:32:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins, retest this please.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50718557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50718757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1643#issuecomment-50718757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1643","id":50718757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzE4NzU3","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-31T06:33:51Z","updated_at":"2014-07-31T06:33:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good question, it's dangerous to mix threads and fork(), it may be cause dead lock in child process.
