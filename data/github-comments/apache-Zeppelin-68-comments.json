I have investigated further.\nSee also this related issue https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2866.\n\nIt seems that, at the moment, there is only one workaround to address the `ECONNRESET error (HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy authentication required)` that is using HTTP requests, like I did with npm configuration:\n\n```\nnpm config set registry \"http://registry.npmjs.org/\"\nnpm config set strict-ssl false\n```\n\nUnfortunately Bower is currently unable to handle the HTTP request, so you will always hit the authentication error. I have also tried Fiddler with and without `Automatically Authenticate` option and changing the User-Agent with no success. \n\nThe strange thing is that if I open one of the failing request with Chrome/curl I can see the JSON repsonse:\n\n```\ncurl https://bower.herokuapp.com/packages/json3\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n

It needs [shiro authentication setting](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/security/shiroauthentication.html). But still you can add your credential info as `anonymous`, even if you didn't activate shiro. It's a default setting. I think this information need to be added to docs too. Users might be confused too.\n- **Docs link** : Regarding docs link, you can't see currently since this docs was newly added by this PR. If you want to see this docs, you have to build the website in your local as described in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation). It's little bit tiresome, so I added screenshot images. \n\nAnd appreciate for your feedbacks.
