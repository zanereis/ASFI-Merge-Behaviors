Difference:\r\n\tThe reason why system busy and broker busy are thrown when messages are sent is that the PageCache is busy, which means that when a message is appended to the PageCache, the time taken for a single message to be sent is more than 1s, and if you continue to send messages to the Broker server and wait for them, the TPS cannot be satisfied at all. Therefore, the rapid failure mechanism will be used, directly to the message sender to return the error, the message sender will retry 2 times by default, the message will be sent to the other Broker, to ensure that it is highly available.\r\n\r\n### The solution is as follows:\r\n\t1. Enable \"read/write\" separation\r\n\t\tEnable \"read/write\" separation by setting transientStorePoolEnable=true in broker.config. Disadvantage: Increase the possibility of data loss.\r\n\t2. Expansion of the Broker server\r\n\t\tWhen the Broker server itself is busy, fast failure, and in the next period of time will avoid the Broker, so that the Broker recovery time guarantee, the Broker's own architecture is to support distributed horizontal expansion, increase the number of queues in the Topic, reduce the load on a single Broker server, so as to avoid the emergence of the PageCache. PageCache.\r\n\t\r\n###

Is this in line with expectations?\r\n\r\nof course,\r\nRocketMQ triggers the rebalancing process when all grayscale consumer clients do not exist (for example, the consumer goes online after the grayscale verification passes or the grayscale consumer goes offline abnormally). During this process, it is detected that all consumer ClientiDs do not contain the @gray identifier, so other normal consumer clients will immediately take over the consumption of messages, and any messages left in the gray scale queue will also be immediately taken over by normal consumer clients to ensure that messages are not lost.\r\n\r\nYou can see the related documentation:[语雀](https://www.yuque.com/u2210974/zrf1wg/bgqmutg83wyeyzfq)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2262576138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2262580555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8468#issuecomment-2262580555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8468","id":2262580555,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86G3D1L","user":{"login":"syhleo","id":26354748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzU0NzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26354748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo","html_url":"https://github.com/syhleo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syhleo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-01T09:28:06Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T13:04:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the related documentation:[语雀](https://www.yuque.com/u2210974/zrf1wg/bgqmutg83wyeyzfq)\r\n\r\nEasy access.

If only the production is gray, the consumption is not gray, that is, the gray consumption does not exist at all, that is, all the messages are consumed by the normal consumer end. However, first of all, the change of MQ message data format, the production side and the consumer side are to be logically adjusted together, if your business scene inside the production side of the grayscale message and the data format of the ordinary message is inconsistent, the consumer side needs to follow together with the grayscale, so that the grayscale consumer side consumes the grayscale message (data format A). The normal consumer consumes normal messages (data format B). This is also the full-link gray scale release that we have been

For schemes such as Shadow topic and group, on the one hand, there is a critical problem, that is, when gray verification is switched to prod, there may be messages missed consumption, which is unacceptable. On the other hand, there is the cost problem. If you think about the relatively large scale of the business, the cost brought by doubling each topic and group can not be ignored. \r\nThis solution is to let rocketmq native support grayscale capabilities through gray partitioning, so that users low cost, easy access.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2270692927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2271700727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8504#issuecomment-2271700727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8504","id":2271700727,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86HZ2b3","user":{"login":"TeFuirnever","id":42903364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTAzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42903364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever","html_url":"https://github.com/TeFuirnever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TeFuirnever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-06T16:35:58Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:35:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"for
