the select statement retunrned events with `value` > 0 in each event. after doing the ingestion all values were zeroed out. \nDoesnt seem like an aggregator issue since we specified 'none' index granularity and also the select statement correctly returns minute level rows.\n\nDefinitely something wrong with the IngestSegment firehose\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/55707793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/55765731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/732#issuecomment-55765731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/732","id":55765731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzY1NzMx","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-16T15:57:15Z","updated_at":"2014-09-16T15:57:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pdeva
