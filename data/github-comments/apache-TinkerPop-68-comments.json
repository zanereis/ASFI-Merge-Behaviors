I saw you were having some trouble running the tests locally. The basic requirements for running the tests are JDK 8 or 11 (17 is currently unsupported), and docker needs to be running. You also will need to create an empty file with the path `tinkerpop/gremlin-go/.glv` to activate the maven profile for the go GLV. Then you should be able to run all of the tests by running `mvn clean install`. The relevant docs for this are [here](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#development-environment) if you haven't found them yet. These tests also run in our github actions on your PR if you don't want to setup the local environment just yet.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be one test failing in the checks right now. The maven logs can be a bit much to search through, I like to search for `❌` in the logs to find the failing test quickly. It appears that `gremlin-go/driver/gorillaTransporter.go:68` can sometimes result in a nil pointer dereference.\r\n\r\nI'll spend some time tomorrow taking a closer look and seeing if I can help out at all with the tests. If you do try to get the tests running locally, feel free to reach out here or on discord for more specific help with any issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1467209393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1468605225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1990#issuecomment-1468605225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1990","id":1468605225,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5XiSMp","user":{"login":"vkagamlyk","id":7605999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7605999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk","html_url":"https://github.com/vkagamlyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-14T18:17:51Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T18:17:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@disq
