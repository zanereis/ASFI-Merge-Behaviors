I am gathering the small fixes for the 0.11 website right now, I will update them all at once, thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question around Flink, use the guide here: https://iceberg.apache.org/flink/#custom-catalog, the minimum you need is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE CATALOG my_catalog WITH (\r\n  'type'='iceberg',\r\n  'catalog-impl'='org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.GlueCatalog',\r\n  'warehouse'='s3://my-bucket/my/key/prefix'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAWS credentials are accessed through the default credential chain that tries to retrieve credentials in a series of approaches: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html\r\n\r\nIf you need more customization such as endpoint, you can load your own AwsClientFactory through the guide https://iceberg.apache.org/aws/#aws-client-customization","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/768870857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/768873706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2168#issuecomment-768873706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2168","id":768873706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODg3MzcwNg==","user":{"login":"bkahloon","id":42993708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTkzNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42993708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon","html_url":"https://github.com/bkahloon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkahloon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-28T08:02:13Z","updated_at":"2021-01-28T08:02:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was able to use the following changes in the `sql-client-defaults.yaml` file to get an integration between Flink SQL Client, Iceberg and AWS Glue\r\n\r\n``` \r\ncatalogs: \r\n  - name: iceberg\r\n    type: iceberg\r\n    catalog-impl: org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.GlueCatalog\r\n    lock-impl: org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.DynamoLockManager\r\n    lock.table: icebergGlueLockTable\r\n    warehouse: s3://warehouse-bucket/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also added the Iceberg Flink runtime jar to Flink's lib directory as well as the AWS SDK and HTTP client jars as well.

made me think a lot about what the behavior should be. Before diving further into the review, I think we should agree on that.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 cases for loading tables:\r\n* Hadoop table identified by its location\r\n* Hive catalog table tracked in the current metastore\r\n* A table in any catalog where the metastore is a reference\r\n\r\nIdeally, a Hive table that is owned by the Hive metastore would require no additional property to point it to a catalog, because the metastore is unnamed and is basically global. A table in another catalog would have a table property, `iceberg.catalog`, that has the other catalog's name. That leaves Hadoop tables and I would use a property like `iceberg.type=hadoop` to signal that the table location should be used to load it. I would not use a reserved catalog name to identify Hadoop tables to avoid colliding with user catalog names (e.g., \"hadoop\"), but we could make it reasonably unlikely if we wanted to use `iceberg.catalog=location_based_table` or something.\r\n\r\nWe also have existing behavior:\r\n* `iceberg.mr.catalog` is not defined: load all Iceberg tables as Hadoop tables using the location\r\n* `iceberg.mr.catalog=hive`: load all Iceberg tables using the table name from a HiveCatalog for the metastore URI\r\n* `iceberg.mr.catalog=hadoop`: load all Iceberg tables using the table name from a HadoopCatalog for the location stored in `iceberg.mr.catalog.hadoop.warehouse.location`\r\n* `iceberg.mr.catalog.loader.class`: when defined, load all Iceberg tables using the catalog produced by the loader class. This is primarily for direct use of the `InputFormat`, not for Hive.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the current behavior when `iceberg.mr.catalog` is not set and the table has no catalog set is to load the table's location. The \"ideal\" behavior I outlined above would load the table from an anonymous `HiveCatalog` created for the metastore URI. I don't really like the option of adding more table-level config if we can avoid it.\r\n\r\nHere's what I propose:\r\n* If a table has `iceberg.catalog` or `iceberg.type=hadoop`, then use the ideal behavior (no conflict with existing)\r\n* If a table does not have those properties, fall back to the value of `iceberg.mr.catalog`:\r\n    * When not defined: load the Iceberg table from the metastore by name\r\n    * `location`: load the Iceberg table as a Hadoop table by location\r\n    * `hive`: use the existing behavior for backward-compatibility\r\n    * `hadoop`: use the existing behavior for backward-compatibility\r\n\r\nI think this is a good compromise for behavior. If someone wants the default to be location-based table loading, then all they need to change is to set `iceberg.mr.catalog=location`. The other cases are unchanged, and the default is to load tables from the metastore (as expected). While it is a behavior change, I think it is a reasonable one.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n* I didn't mention a property to control table identifier above, like `iceberg.identifier`, but I think that would make sense. I would not support it for tables tracked in the metastore, though. It does not make sense to have a pointer to another table owned by the metastore.\r\n* Because the loader class is intended for the `InputFormat`, I think we should handle it in Hive by making sure it is not set or by using a different load method that ignores it. There should be no need to provide backward compatibility for this and we haven't documented it anywhere.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/769503071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/769503822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2180#issuecomment-769503822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2180","id":769503822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTUwMzgyMg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T01:10:58Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T01:10:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tests passed the first time through.

\"hive\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.uri\", \"https://my.hive.cluster.com:9083\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.warehouse\", \"/warehouse\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombine with Russell's answer, the complete config should be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog\", \"org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkSessionCatalog\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.type\", \"hive\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.uri\", \"https://my.hive.ip.com:9083\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.warehouse\", \"/warehouse-hive\") // I use a different path here to distinguish the two catalogs\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.local\", \"org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkSessionCatalog\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.local.type\", \"hadoop\")\r\n.config(\"spark.sql.catalog.local.warehouse\", \"/warehouse\")\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/769967215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/769967574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2169#issuecomment-769967574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2169","id":769967574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTk2NzU3NA==","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T18:18:12Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T18:18:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A
