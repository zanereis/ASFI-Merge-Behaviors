This is a huge gap right now that is preventing us from using Airflow for Dataflow jobs. That said, I wonder if you've considered exposing more than just the last line? My (limited) understanding of Dataflow is that there are both client (i.e. Airflow-side) and server (i.e. Data flow machine) logs.\r\n\r\nThis patch appears to expose only the final line of the client-side logs. Is this really sufficient to triage failures? What do you think about exposing all client-side logs? What about exposing server-side logs as well, which will likely have the actual relevant information (e.g. stack traces, whatever) that's needed to debug issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/337970139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/337999670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2532#issuecomment-337999670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2532","id":337999670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzk5OTY3MA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T18:40:48Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T18:44:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aoen @saguziel what do you guys think?

Thus in case where the Rest API makes sense, the UI should use this. \r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?\r\n\r\n@criccomini @aoen @jgao54 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/338497473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/338497581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2704#issuecomment-338497581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2704","id":338497581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODQ5NzU4MQ==","user":{"login":"Acehaidrey","id":10408007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDA4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10408007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey","html_url":"https://github.com/Acehaidrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Acehaidrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-22T18:14:52Z","updated_at":"2017-10-22T18:14:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah perfect thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/338497581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/338497679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2482#issuecomment-338497679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2482","id":338497679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODQ5NzY3OQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-22T18:16:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-22T18:16:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwax the idea here was to have lineage/auditing by removing it from the db this purpose is gone.

When returning it return the ids to the @action function for the TaskInstance model, values which have a period ('.') in them are duplicated. I'm going to look into this, but it isn't a problem with airflow.\r\n> Looking deeper into flask_admin I think this is the reason. flask_admin runs an escape function in it's get_pk_value in the flask_admin.contrib.sqla.view.ModelView class (https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/blob/master/flask_admin/contrib/sqla/view.py#L399-L407). That escape function is imported from flask_admin.contrib.sqla.tools which imports it from flask_admin.tools. It escapes the CHAR_ESCAPE with two CHAR_ESCAPE's values. \r\nThose CHAR_ESCAPE values are set as '.':\r\nhttps://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/blob/master/flask_admin/tools.py#L7\r\nHere's the escape function:\r\nhttps://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/blob/master/flask_admin/tools.py#L104-L107\r\nThat's then called in the BaseModelView.index_view method here:\r\nhttps://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/blob/master/flask_admin/model/base.py#L1975\r\nAnd that is then inherited in the flask_admin.contrib.sqla.view.ModelView class. That is then the base class for airflow.www.AirflowModelView, which is the base class for airflow.www.ModelViewOnly, which is the base class for airflow.www.TaskInstanceModelView.\r\n\r\nThis causes any '.' characters in the at least compound primary keys to become duplicated. Given that all SubDAG's are enforced to have a period in the dag_id column and that the primary key for the task_instance model is execution_date, dag_id, and task_id, the returned dag_id given to the action is always incorrect.\r\n\r\nConsiderations for solution:\r\n> We could possibly reach out to the flask_admin developers to understand why they are doing this escaping.
