So, you can then write essentially arbitrary C or assembly microkernels - simple example:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid vadd_16_avx2(const float *x, int32_t x_off, const float *y,\r\n                  int32_t y_off, float *z, int32_t z_off) {\r\n  for (size_t i = 0; i < 16; i += 8) {\r\n    _mm256_storeu_ps(z + z_off + i,\r\n                     _mm256_add_ps(_mm256_loadu_ps(x + x_off + i),\r\n                                   _mm256_loadu_ps(y + y_off + i)));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have that passed into a tensor op declaration like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def intrin_vadd_16():\r\n        x = tvm.placeholder((16,), name='vx')\r\n        y = tvm.placeholder((16,), name='vy')\r\n        z = tvm.compute(x.shape, lambda i: x[i] + y[i], name='z')\r\n        def intrin_func(ins, outs):\r\n            xx, yy = ins\r\n            zz = outs[0]\r\n            irb = tvm.ir_builder.create()\r\n            extern_call = tvm.call_extern(\r\n                \"int32\",\r\n                \"vadd_16_avx2\",\r\n                irb.buffer_ptr(xx),\r\n                xx.elem_offset,\r\n                irb.buffer_ptr(yy),\r\n                yy.elem_offset,\r\n                irb.buffer_ptr(zz),\r\n                zz.elem_offset)\r\n            irb.emit(extern_call)\r\n            return irb.get()\r\n            return irbb\r\n\r\n        with tvm.build_config(offset_factor=16):\r\n            return tvm.decl_tensor_intrin(z.op, intrin_func)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then use that in a TVM expression like any other tensor intrinsic. The microkernel can get (optionally) completely inlined into the main TVM loop, etc, inline assembly works, etc. It seems to work correctly as well with simple matmul kernels as well. Is that similar to what you had in mind?\r\n\r\nOne thought for an intermediate goal is to get a TVM GEMM that is actually within 5% of performance of MKL or Accelerate on AVX2. Currently even with the best schedules I could find in https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/tutorials/optimize/opt_gemm.py, it's ~25-50% slower than MKL or Accelerate on my I7-4980HQ, and from looking at the generated code I suspect we need more control over the microkernels to beat that last gap.  Are you folks interested in this direction as well? \r\n\r\nAnother example is taking the Conv(1x64x56x56, 64x64x1x1) from ResNet 18, the best TVM performance I could get on AVX2 hits 35GFLOP/s single threaded, while the equivalent GEMM with a BLAS library is 2x faster at 70GFLOP/s.

By reading the tutorial, it seems to me that in order to run the TVM program on FPGAs, you require users to specify the `pipeline` binding like TVM now requires users to specify `thread` binding for OpenCL on GPUs. As I know, this user-specified binding helps not only kernel optimization but host device splitting. Is it the way you identify the FPGA kernel scope?\r\n2. Could you explain the current limitation of HLS code generation? I briefly reviewed the HLS code generation and it seems to me that now you only generate the corresponding `ap_uint` data type and insert interface pragmas. I know other optimization pragmas such as `unroll` or `pipeline` could be added in the future, but I'd like to know if there have any case that you currently cannot support.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/397427413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/397436408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1214#issuecomment-397436408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1214","id":397436408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzQzNjQwOA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T20:59:45Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T20:59:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kevinthesun

performance (+/-10%) to Accelerate/MKL single-threaded on most GEMMs, without any scheduling work involved (i.e. just constructing full panels separately, then tensorizing the reduction) - and presumably a scheduling guru could get this even better. AFAIK I haven't seen any TVM schedules that can get within 30% of this number on my i7-4980HQ - if there are, please let me know. \r\n\r\nI think this could be a pretty interesting for FP32 NN performance - e.g. this could be directly used to improve 1x1 perf for e.g.  FP32 MobileNet on AVX2.\r\n\r\nI think in terms of a TVM API, it'd be nice to directly support C/ASM source files that can be automatically compiled and linked against (handling cases like just standard intrinsics or C functions, using inline assembly, and even directly using ASM from an assembler like PeachPy, etc).

As I know, this user-specified binding helps not only kernel optimization but host device splitting. Is it the way you identify the FPGA kernel scope?\r\n\r\nYes, exactly.  I think it's the most intuitive way, but any other suggestions would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n> Could you explain the current limitation of HLS code generation? I briefly reviewed the HLS code generation and it seems to me that now you only generate the corresponding ap_uint data type and insert interface pragmas. I know other optimization pragmas such as unroll or pipeline could be added in the future, but I'd like to know if there have any case that you currently cannot support.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of code semantics, I guess there is no limitation; Vivado HLS could compile the generated code as far as FPGA resource is available.  For optimization, there are many things we have to do, but they would be future work as you said.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/397520614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/397523012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1188#issuecomment-397523012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1188","id":397523012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzUyMzAxMg==","user":{"login":"kaishijeng","id":12689630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg5NjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12689630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng","html_url":"https://github.com/kaishijeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaishijeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T06:07:45Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T06:09:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@srkreddy1238 \r\n\r\nWhat happens to below to support mobilenet?\r\nhttps://github.com/srkreddy1238/tvm/tree/c5e852e9bc0cc763a69dbb3a7a8baf2c557e07ce\r\nWill you create a PR for it?
