I've thought of linking to docs.openrewrite.org, but that then just shows an URL quite similar to the app.moderne.io link for this one: https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/maven/cleanup/prefixlessexpressions\r\nAnd while that page does contain instructions for a rerun, I don't think such a link would add very much more details in this particular case that are not available from the Moderne link. Perhaps it would help if we allow access to recipe pages without a login such that the details are immediately visible; that's come up before, but gets tricky with authentication. No perfect solution I guess.
