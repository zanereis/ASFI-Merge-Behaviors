And actually this commit 2630361ca24737c28f458825b20ab11c9c996b17 convinced my that I had it right. That's why I wrote this PR.\r\n\r\nI understand your point because you actually look at it from the schedulers point of view, I look at it from the users point of view. I already know 2 people in my team that fell into the trap with join nodes. And **documenting it alone isn't enough**, I would then be **prepared to change** this PR into a **raise when we detect** this with ALL_SUCCESS trigger.\r\n\r\nStill the first DAG I wrote will never work with the only alternative I have (ONE_SUCCESS), because the branch operator starts a branch that fans out to a lot of parallel tasks that all join together to the same node where the skipped branch arrive. This will never work with the ONE_SUCESS because as soon as one of the parallel branches succeed the rest will just stop. I know I **can hack around this** by introducing a DummyOperator where all successful branches arrive, but I feel dirty if I need to do this.\r\n\r\nSo I propose this:\r\n\r\n- I'll change this PR so the ALL_SUCCESS raises and error.\r\n- Start on another PR that introduces 2 new triggers:\r\n-- ALL_SUCCESS_OR_SKIPPED\r\n-- ALL_FAILED_OR_SKIPPED\r\n\r\nWhat do you

However, I also feel that the INFO level is more appropriate to follow the task progress.\r\n\r\nAnother question: I see that that you adhere to the 90 characters limit for line lengths (original PEP-8 recommendation). However, I believe that sometimes this is bad for code readability... A lot of modern open source projects have already extended the limit to 120 characters (which is also the default in IDE's like pycharm).

I was trying to use the existing execution_date argument set up for use with other airflow [command] calls, but this is set as a required positional parameter for these calls. As such I've had to call the parameter \"exec_date\" instead. When I tried to set it up with the verbose flag: \r\n\"--execution_date\" I still got an error, so I tried the verbose flag \"--exec_date\" instead. This then worked, but showed up that I'd missed the pass through calls in the api/client folder, which I've now fixed. Tests are passing. LandscapeIO is unhappy, but seems to have picked up issues in files that I've not touched and none new in the files that I have touched.

It would not work in our environment because we require 2FA which would then require a second factor check that further makes this Okta specific.

The time taken to land the last partition is approximately the same before and after the change (~62 seconds). Inspecting the code, I see that the polling interval for the DAG file processor - https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs.py#L1423-L1427 - is set to 1 second by default - https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs.py#L472. Which means we don't really get much gain from scheduling all unblocked tasks in a single loop iteration, instead of one task per loop, since we have to wait only 1 second between iterations.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Based on these results, I don't think it makes sense to merge this PR.\r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin you mentioned seeing delays with workers getting saturated with recent runs. Does the scheduler_ops_metrics test I wrote cover the scenario you had in mind? I can modify the test to be more representative.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```\r\nPerformance Results\r\n###################\r\nDAG perf_dag_1\r\n        dag_id      task_id execution_date  queue_delay
