I've updated the code to reflect most of the changes you suggested.  Specifically,\r\n- Merged all of the previously new classes in `o.a.s.client.api.endpoint` into a new class `ClusterPropertyApis` and all of the previously new classes `o.a.s.handler.admin.api` into a new class `ClusterProperty` (updated to extend/use `AdminAPIBase`),\r\n- Removed all of the previously new classes that were merged above,\r\n- Updated the v1 code in `CollectionsHandler` to use the new `ClusterProperty` APIs,\r\n- Removed the old v2 code in `ClusterAPI` (both `setObjProperty` which you suggested and `setProperty` which I had originally left unchanged (used the v1 API code path) as both were v2 experimental ClusterProps APIs),\r\n- Moved registration of the new code from `CoreContainer` to `CollectionsHandler`,\r\n- Updated the v2 JAX-RS Fetch Single ClusterProp API (`getClusterProperty`) to return a 404 instead of a 400, and\r\n- Added the missing `@PermissionName` annotations (now in `ClusterProperty`).\r\n\r\nA couple of code suggestions are outstanding:\r\n\r\n> [-0] These tests seem like a good candidate for using the SolrJ classes generated by your API definitions (i.e. `o.a.s.client.solrj.request.ClusterPropertiesApi`).\r\n> \r\n> Doing so feels a bit circular (i.e. any bugs in the JAX-RS annotations would get propagated to the generated code and might not be caught)...but it'd help the tests to scan a lot nicer IMO, and it'd get us coverage for the SolrJ classes to boot, so it sees like a worthwhile tradeoff IMO. Wdyt?\r\n\r\nI hadn't thought of this earlier, but think it's a good idea as it would let us test the SolrJ classes.  I don't know enough about the code generation or how annotation bugs might lead to masking errors - perhaps it would be helpful to have a specific set of tests that checks an underlying API in multiple ways (using the SolrJ APIs and  HttpClient calls or something similar?) but generally let test code just use the SolrJ APIs?  In any event, I'm running into a couple of problems here that I think are related to code generation.\r\n\r\nProblem 1:  I added one new unit test (`testClusterPropertyFetchNonExistentPropertySolrJ`, left the others unchanged) using a generated SolrJ API.  I didn't see any other unit tests that used the other generated classes from `o.a.s.client.solrj.request` so am guessing as to the proper way to use generated client code.  This particular test is meant to return an error, and I believe it triggers an error when the request is handled server-side, but the invocation of the client API (`new ClusterPropertiesApi.GetClusterProperty(\"ext.clusterPropThatDoesNotExist\").process(client)`) does not throw an exception as I had expected, so the unit test fails.  Not sure how to check for errors otherwise.\r\n\r\n>Hmm - I think you should be able to nuke `SetNestedClusterPropertyRequestBody` altogether, and replace it in the method signature with `Map<String, Object>`\r\n\r\nProblem 2:  when I did this, the generated code below (in `o.a.s.client.solrj.request.ClusterPropertiesApi`) could not be compiled:\r\n```java\r\nthis.requestBody = new Map<String, Object>();\r\n```\r\nas Map is an abstract class.  Replacing `SetNestedClusterPropertyRequestBody` with `HashMap<String, Object>` yields the exact same issue (the generated code tries to instantiate a `Map`).  I left this part unchanged.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1:  while I also prefer having related calls be in the same class, this has resulted in two similarly named classes that could be confusing:  `o.a.s.handler.admin.api.ClusterProperty` and `org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ClusterProperties`.

The gist is to mainain the csv file with metadata of all changes, and edit the py script to output the correct htacces. \r\n\r\nWe likely need to make another CSV section for pages removed in 10.0 guide, and then generate the correct redeirects..\r\n\r\nI don't remember where / how the generated htaccess file is checked in though. And I know Antora has some built-in support for generating htaccess as well, should look into it..\r\n\r\nTo be pragmatic and unblock this, I'd make a Blocker JIRA for 10.0 and maintain a list of the removed pages there, so someone can update htaccess in proper way in due time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2459554765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2459640150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2835#issuecomment-2459640150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2835","id":2459640150,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6SmyFW","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-06T12:36:25Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T12:36:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have added https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17546 to track the blocker task, I don't know if I did the \"label\" right, there were a lot to choose from!

ended up finding : req.getCoreContainer().getFileStore() and it returns a org.apache.solr.filestore.DistribFileStore, so by best bet is that the file-store @dsmiley  is referring is: org.apache.solr.filestore.DistribFileStore\r\nNow, that FileStore has a get method 'org.apache.solr.filestore.DistribFileStore#get' that surprisingly doesn't return anything (return type is void) but

follows:\r\n1) it took me a decent amount of time to implement the functionality taking inspiration from the LTR module, it's taking way more time to do it via the FileStore. \r\nIt's not easy to find information about it on the Reference guide, and it was not intuitive to understand the right code to look at.\r\nIf that's the route we want new developers to follow for storing models and similar managed resources in Solr, I suspect we need to make it way easier to understand and interact with.\r\n JavaDocs were pretty much missing and code examples or tests not easy to be found.\r\n \r\n N.B. these are just pragmatic observations to improve it, no offence to whoever designed and implemented this (I have not even checked)\r\n

Are there any updates on this?\r\n\r\nHey @zzBrunoBrito , thanks for the comment! We are currently testing out a fork of this change internally in my company. Would you be willing to test this yourself as a beta user? Your feedback could drive decisions about the direction of this change, i.e. what features to include/exclude. Let me know what you need to test this module. If you can check out the branch and build it you should be able to pick up the `solr-monitor-10.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar` from the `solr/modules/monitor/build/libs/` directory and then add it to your solr process's classpath. I'll try to think of an easier way of distributing this change if that sounds too complicated.\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask for you to test it is because one of the blockers for merging this was the limited scope. \"Solr-monitor\" is a somewhat niche feature so the community is a little hesitant to commit to maintaining yet another module unless there is at least some interest in it (which is why your comment is much appreciated).\r\n\r\nMaybe we can communicate about this on Solr's slack channel since there might be a bit of back-and-forth getting this to work for you at the start. I will eventually document this change but was putting that part off since I wasn't sure anyone would read it 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2461095739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2461467862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2849#issuecomment-2461467862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2849","id":2461467862,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6StwTW","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T07:02:24Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T07:02:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could we call compress() universally and then our compressor chooses to only compress based on our criteria (state.json)?

I'm not convinced anymore that I should spend effort in that direction for this specific use case, using the fileStore and deleting the embedding model store was seducing, but if I need to implement an additional mechanism to handle models to be singleton on top of it, I don't see much benefit especially from development time perspective.\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I missed something or if you believe the current implementation won't work in certain scenarios.\r\nI'm super happy to spend the effort to make a cleaner contribution, but if it's a lot of effort only for a \"nice to have\", I don't think I have that luxury right now.\r\n\r\nDon't take it as provocative, it's just a genuine perspective of someone with limited time to dedicate to the project, if I was paid full-time on this I wouldn't have any problem in pursuing nice to haves.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2461910357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2461934671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2761#issuecomment-2461934671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2761","id":2461934671,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6SviRP","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T11:00:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T11:00:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@janhoy  would you mind weighing in ont this PR since it changes a default behavior?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2461934671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2461943259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2809#issuecomment-2461943259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2809","id":2461943259,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6SvkXb","user":{"login":"alessandrobenedetti","id":513195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti","html_url":"https://github.com/alessandrobenedetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T11:03:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T18:21:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> When you look at the model store, it would be great to hear where it comes up short and we could look at improving it.

It is nice to have options to choose from and to compare with one another for decisions of this scale.\r\n\r\nNo problem, this is just an experience for me and my friends.\r\n\r\n> I have a few questions in regards to the changes included that would be great if you can answer them:\r\n> \r\n> * What was the reason again you had to rename / move the initial webapp module?\r\n> * Have you looked into the file size of a deployment? This would be an interesting value to compare with other framework if you have it available.\r\n> * The current state of the PR seems to not integrate the Angular project into the current \"deployment\", resulting in CORS issues when running with `npm start`. Do you have any instructions on how to run it so that we can see the UI in action?\r\n\r\nLet's start from the first question:\r\n\r\n1. I've planned to integrate two completely different solution that is going to work in parallel and place switch to new implementation that person can simply change it to old one.\r\n2.  At this moment including all of the assets the total solution is cost 267 kb, in the later versions it might grow unto 2 - 3 mb may be a little bit more, because we are producing a bundle that holds everything. \r\n3. That's correct, I didn't invest enough time to merge to two different approaches to work under same server, usually for that is responsible app server in our case, it must be done via web.xml + might be require additional filter or something changes in the java app itself to consume and work with two approaches.\r\n\r\n> A short feedback about improving the quality of your PR: If it would be possible to keep the current webapp untouched, the PR would be much smaller and easier to review. The lines of code would also better represent the actual work and part that should be reviewed. Seeing 55k lines of code \"scares\" many reviewers, even if it is just generated or moved stuff.\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll try to revert most of the changes related to the current solution back that it won't affect  PR.\r\n\r\n> I would also like to have a documentation that provide resources for further reading or basic ideas behind things like project structure (of the frontend of course). I think this would give our current community an easier start for both reviewing and working with the code.\r\n\r\nWell, I'm not sure what do you mean under the documentation with this.

[...] I gather the correct changes to api.mustache would make the generated code throw an exception in the right case.\r\n\r\n*sigh* No it's not a template problem - I think you've uncovered a design implication I hadn't realized up until now.\r\n\r\nIn short - SolrClients typically parse the response into a \"NamedList\" that is then immediately inspected to see whether there were any server errors that should result in a client-side exception.  But for these generated v2 classes, the response-parsing happens much much later - nothing gets parsed until the caller has already received a SolrResponse instance and invokes a special `getParsed()` method.  Which unintentionally side-steps SolrClient's response-inspection and exception throwing logic entirely, without giving it any sort of replacement.\r\n\r\nIt's fixable, but definitely beyond the scope of what we'd want to bring into this PR.  I've created a separate JIRA ticket to discuss more: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17549\r\n\r\nIn the meantime - forget I said anything about having tests that use the generated SolrJ objects.  I'd love to backfill those tests later once we've worked out some of the kinks in how the generated classes need to work, but that shouldn't block this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2462819695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2462829051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2788#issuecomment-2462829051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2788","id":2462829051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Sy8n7","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T17:27:17Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T17:27:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The discussion here has gotten a bit long, but to summarize my understanding: \"Problem 1\" and \"Problem 2\" are both resolved, the first by virtue of being punted to SOLR-17549 and the second by a minor 'api.mustache' template fix.
