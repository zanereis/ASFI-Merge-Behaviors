There's a race condition, the test relies on the underlying queue in `ParallelIterable` being populated by the time the non empty assertion is run, that's not guaranteed. I verified this theory by adding a sleep before offering to the queue here https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/util/ParallelIterable.java#L70\r\n\r\nI'll work on a PR for fixing this test, we should be able to use Awaitility. Ideally we don't even have tests which rely on such timing but looking at the context https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5887 I think it's important to have this specific case since we want to validate the memory is cleared up for engines.

We recently had an issue where using a `hdfs` location without authority caused a user's data to be deleted by the `RemoveOrphanFiles` action because the resolution of the table root changed. The main problem is that places in Iceberg would need to have some idea of \"equivalent\" paths and path resolution. Full URIs are much easier to work with and more reliable.\r\n> \r\n> But there is still a way to do both. Catalogs and tables can inject their own `FileIO` implementation, which is what is used to open files. That can do any resolution that you want based on environment. So you could use an implementation that allows you to override a portion of the file URI and read it from a different underlying location. I think that works better overall because there are no mistakes about equivalent URIs, but you can still read a table copy without rewriting the metadata.\r\n\r\n@rdblue  We tried injecting own FileIO via spark config which will replace the table/metadata path prefix with new location, this works till reading table metadata but while reading parquet files it struck in BatchDataReader.java in following function, Please provide your thoughts on this if there is some other way of achieving this.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprotected CloseableIterator<ColumnarBatch> open(FileScanTask task) {\r\n    String filePath = task.file().path().toString();\r\n    LOG.debug(\"Opening data file {}\", filePath);\r\n\r\n    // update the current file for Spark's filename() function\r\n    InputFileBlockHolder.set(filePath, task.start(), task.length());\r\n\r\n    Map<Integer, ?> idToConstant = constantsMap(task, expectedSchema());\r\n\r\n   /*** below given code line is causing issue because its searching name given in metadata in the map which will be replaced by custom FileIO, changing this line to InputFile inputFile = table.io().newInputFile(filePath); is making it work but this remove the encryption logic, in short we couldn't make it work with only Custom FileIO\r\n**/\r\n\r\n    InputFile inputFile = getInputFile(filePath);\r\n    Preconditions.checkNotNull(inputFile, \"Could not find InputFile associated with FileScanTask\");\r\n    SparkDeleteFilter deleteFilter =\r\n        task.deletes().isEmpty()\r\n            ?

Can help me understand, every update to the table, there will be new snapshot created.

The primary limiting factor lies in the fact that `replace` snapshots, which add and remove data files without changing the actual data and are what rewrite procedures use, do not keep close track of what files were used to create what other files and how.\r\n\r\nThis means that, even if support were added for interpreting `replace` snapshots as is, their replacement files could only be used if every file removed by the replace was included in the interval of the incremental read.\r\n\r\nThis could be moderately improved if `replace` snapshots stored a map of what specific files were used in the creation of what other files, but even then it still wouldn't be helpful in a lot of cases, as rewrite by default will generally end up merging files from inside the incremental read interval with files from outside the incremental read interval.\r\n\r\nI will note that it would be beneficial if Iceberg could support this behavior, as it would help mitigate the performance impact of micro-batch file ingestion on incremental reads that take place after compaction.
