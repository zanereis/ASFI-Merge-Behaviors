In this particular test, I'm looking at plan quality. I also attempt some performance tests at the end, though the results here were done on a VM with uncontrolled competing workload and so must be taken with a grain of salt. Some interesting things to note. Near the end of the test, I vary the cardinality of the set of rows being deleted to see when we switch over from using an index scan to a base table scan when deciding which rows to delete. The crossover point is between queries D7000 and D7500. I also execute these DELETEs and capture their execution time statistics. The plan execution times are in the same ballpark, which suggests that the crossover point is reasonable. I was watching with \"top\" while these DELETEs were running; during the first one there were two competing builds running on the system (hence the higher elapsed time), for the next four only one competing build. Builds vary in their resource use over time so this affected the test times.\n\n> > obey TEST001(setup1);\n> > \n> > drop table if exists np001;\n\n--- SQL operation complete.\n\n> > drop table if
