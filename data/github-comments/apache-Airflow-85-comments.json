Personally I would integrate the `SPARK_HOME` variable in the connection string, by extracting this from the piggybacked json, see:\r\nhttps://github.com/camshrun/incubator-airflow/blob/199948356d6812aab8513eb77dfc85fda332551d/airflow/contrib/hooks/spark_submit_hook.py#L102\r\n\r\nPassing the driver memory, and the Java application class is fine to pass it directly to the operator. When something affects all the spark-submit job, I would put it in the connection. If the parameter should be tuned per job, such as the memory or entry class, I would suggest passing it to the hook itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/291444411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/291457992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2214#issuecomment-291457992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2214","id":291457992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTQ1Nzk5Mg==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-04T10:21:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T10:21:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One nit(tish), rest LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/291457992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/291472724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2216#issuecomment-291472724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2216","id":291472724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTQ3MjcyNA==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-04T11:31:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T11:31:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@hgrif, thanks for your PR!
