for the PR @BACtaki. I had an initial look at the code changes today. Before I get into detailed comments, I'd like to clarify a few things.\r\n- Are the optimizations only improve the naive cases where the input dimension is less than 1024 for the given direction (row/col)? \r\n- I see that you are now iterating the dense and sparse inputs in a more cache-conscious manner (reducing CPU cache misses). Are there any other optimizations you are employing (e.g. reducing the number of intermediates)?\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay. I will add my comments and suggestions tomorrow.

for your review @phaniarnab! Comments inline:\r\n\r\n> Are the optimizations only improve the naive cases where the input dimension is less than 1024 for the given direction (row/col)?\r\n\r\nThe cache-conscious iteration optimization only applies to the naive counting case where `nnz < minimumSize \r\n = 1024`. Aside from this, I also refactored `MatrixSketch` and `KMVSketch` to replace the `getScalarValue() -> Integer` method with the `getValue() -> MatrixBlock` method to unify the handling of RowCol, Row, and Col cases (as per @Baunsgaard 's suggestion from an earlier PR). \r\n\r\n> I see that you are now iterating the dense and sparse inputs in a more cache-conscious manner (reducing CPU cache misses). Are there any other optimizations you are employing (e.g. reducing the number of intermediates)?\r\n\r\nReally good point re intermediates. We are actually creating an intermediate `SmallestPriorityQueue` of max size `k = 64` per row/col. The way we are constructing the intermediates places an upper bound on additional memory:\r\n1. RowCol: max 64 double values (64 bits each)\r\n2. Row: `SmallestPriorityQueue spq` is reset between each iteration, so the intermediate is at most 64 double values\r\n3. Col: identical to Row, but the iteration occurs in column-major order and `spq` is reset between iterations of consecutive columns\r\n\r\nThere are no further optimizations beyond cache-conscious iteration in CP case.

I need to select a path at the sites for the workers to write their partition, I am currently choosing to create a (most likely) unique filename and write into the LOCAL_TEMP_DIR (defined by the configuration). This usually works, but the federated python testcases have it set to `/tmp/systemds` which is apparently not available for our git runners. @Baunsgaard maybe we could change the configuration for the tests?\r\n> \r\n> The problems mostly impact our testcases, but I also don't really have a favorite from a user side. Other choices for where to write and downsides:\r\n> \r\n>     * current working directory (cwd): the cwd of our testcases is the root, therefore we would clutter it full of partitions\r\n> \r\n>     * the scratch space: will be deleted when the worker is killed and in our case, because we just start the new workers from the same JVM, also when the testcase finishes. Therefore, we can't check the results.\r\n> \r\n>     * A new configuration directory: pretty clean solution IMO, but would only be used by workers and I don't want to add it, except if we agree it is necessary\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> The other aspects are finished and this PR is ready for review.\r\n\r\nhmm, good question what the best option is.\r\n\r\nI find the last option with a new configuration tempting.\r\nIt could be made such that the federated workers use a configured path to make a directory, furthermore we can use their process ID to make a unique sub directory, and maintain a static counter inside to guarantee incrementing folder/file names, while appending the user specified file name in the end.
