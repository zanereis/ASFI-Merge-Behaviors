This issue only affects these \"raw value\" transformers because they have specifically to do with the serialization, whereas \"child doc transformers\", e.g. don't depend on serialization so it's not a problem for them to be applied at the replica level.\r\n\r\nThis PR basically moves the actual \"raw value\" _actions_ away from the replicas and applies it directly in-line, where (and when) serialization occurs. This I think is appropriate for what these transformers set out to do. I'm happy to go into more detail if it's helpful.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1010372541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1010439994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/515#issuecomment-1010439994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/515","id":1010439994,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM48Ohc6","user":{"login":"madrob","id":1592330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTIzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob","html_url":"https://github.com/madrob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-11T22:54:46Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T22:54:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is kind of a pain, but I’d like to see the commits split into a clean fork and then our changes separately.

I think it would be fine to change Response -> message and leave the information, but if y'all don't think it's useful I won't put up a fight.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with both ways. I probably more tended for the remove option because `toLog` list seems to be intended for logging purposes, not for building responses. I've checked the usages of it and it is always used for logging only (except the case of async calls of admin operations mentioned in this issue). There is also a case of using `toLog` to store `hits` value but it is used just as a value holder, not for the response. It is easy to see if you check the calls of `org.apache.solr.response.SolrQueryResponse.getToLog()` and `org.apache.solr.response.SolrQueryResponse.getToLogAsString(String)`. Another reason is that all this data appear as a response only in an internal subrequest data of async call, not in an outer initial request data, so internal `Request` data seems valuable for me only for debugging purposes.

In the documentation it states @ [Cases where included build substitutions must be declared](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html#included_build_substitution_requirements): \"When the maven-publish or ivy-publish plugins are used for publishing, and the publication coordinates don’t match `${project.group}:${project.name}` ... When the `archivesBaseName` property is used to set the name of the published artifact.\"\r\n\r\nWe don't set `project.group` and `project.name` anywhere in our build system and the automatic name (from directory name) differs from the Maven artifact name, unfortunately. We use `archivesBaseName` instead. The group is only assigned during publishing. If we would do this (we already state `project.description`in every build.gradle and we set the version) and use the archivesBaseName also as gradle project name, then it would work fully automatic.\r\n\r\nIn short if we would set `project.name` with our artifact name and `project.group=\"org.apache.solr\"` then it would work. Description for Maven is also inherited from there. We don't need to change this, but I was stumbling on this discrepancy already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1011150139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1011222062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/512#issuecomment-1011222062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/512","id":1011222062,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM48RgYu","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T16:22:15Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T16:22:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I see you're considering [SOLR-15209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15209) as making `LegacyAssignStrategy` the default placement, when it originally was (and still is in Jira) \"Make the AffinityPlacementFactory the default placement plugin\".\r\n\r\nFair enough, I thought about creating a new ticket, which I still can.

The `install_solr_service.sh` does the exact same thing. Oddly enough, the example configs do not respect $SOLR_HOME, so if you try `docker run --rm -p 8983:8983 solr -e techproducts` then it fails since it tries to write to `/opt/solr/example/techproducts/solr` which is and should be read-only..  It should have used `/var/solr/data/`.\r\n\r\nSo the issue of `SOLR_HOME/lib` not being co-located with the binary install is very old and was an issue long before Docker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1013762263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1013863128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/399#issuecomment-1013863128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/399","id":1013863128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM48blLY","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-16T12:03:20Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T12:01:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added two more improvements:\r\n* Determine if shcemeDesignerEnabled by isPermitted() checks instead of HTTP call\r\n* Disable clickable log-levels page if you don't have CONFIG_EDIT permission.

I have experienced before that certain types of plugins will not work in `$SOLR_HOME/lib`, you have to place them in `WEB-INF/lib`. That is super confusing. I think it is Jetty trying to isolate webapps from each other, but Solr is only one app so we should need no such extra isolation. I don't remember what kind of plugins this was, perhaps it was those with SPI loading or using reflection? Any way I think we should try to let the new`lib/` location be equivalent to `WEB-INF/lib` so it can accept any kind of plugins.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1015190990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1015287079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/536#issuecomment-1015287079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/536","id":1015287079,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM48hA0n","user":{"login":"uschindler","id":1005388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1005388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler","html_url":"https://github.com/uschindler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-18T10:43:49Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T10:46:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the record this is how to use log4j (just some debugging example copypasted):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nstatic final class LoggingAccessLog extends AbstractLifeCycle implements RequestLog {\r\n  private final org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger log;\r\n  \r\n  public LoggingAccessLog(String logname) {\r\n    this.log = org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getLogger(logname);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  @Override\r\n  public void log(Request req, Response resp) {\r\n    final StringBuilder line=new StringBuilder(\"From: \")\r\n      .append(req.getRemoteHost())\r\n      .append(\"; Req: \\\"\").append(req.getMethod()).append(' ').append(req.getRequestURI());\r\n    final String query = req.getQueryString();\r\n    if (query != null) {\r\n      line.append('?').append(query);\r\n    }\r\n    line.append(' ').append(req.getProtocol()).append(\"\\\"; Status: \").append(resp.getStatus()).append(\"; Bytes: \").append(resp.getContentCount());\r\n    final String referer=req.getHeader(HttpHeader.REFERER.asString());\r\n    if (referer!=null) line.append(\"; Referer: \\\"\").append(referer).append('\"');\r\n    final String userAgent=req.getHeader(HttpHeader.USER_AGENT.asString());\r\n    if (userAgent!=null) line.append(\"; User-Agent: \\\"\").append(userAgent).append('\"');\r\n    if (req.isSecure()) line.append(\"; secure\");\r\n    log.info(line.toString());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfinal RequestLogHandler requestLogHandler=new RequestLogHandler();\r\nrequestLogHandler.setRequestLog(new LoggingAccessLog(\"web-access\"));\r\nallJettyHandlers.addHandler(requestLogHandler);\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1015287079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1015387236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/536#issuecomment-1015387236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/536","id":1015387236,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM48hZRk","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-18T12:59:38Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T12:59:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added a major changes entry in ref guide, please review.\r\n\r\nI plan to test this one of these days and then commit to all branches, if no furhter comments.

As far as my use case is concerned, the status code is what really matters to me. You could consider \"all HEAD requests should respond with the correct Content-Length\" as a separate issue\r\n\r\nIf we don't have bandwidth to chase down a better solution, then this sounds like a reasonable compromise to me.  It's not perfect but it moves us in the right direction.  I'd hate to see this contribution stall by letting the perfect get in the way of the good.  If we can get a test working, I wouldn't have any qualms about merging this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat said, if I was trying to fix this from scratch, I'd look higher up in the call stack.  The reporter ran into problems with synonyms/stopwords specifically, sure.  But Solr's handling of HEAD requests likely has similar issues across the board.  At a glance, `/select` and `/update` both have the same problem.  \r\n\r\nCould we find whatever `HttpServlet` implementation Solr is using and add a `doHead` method there, to handle this uniformly for all APIs?  Or alternately, could we find the specific code that zero's out the `Content-Length` and amend that to be http-method-aware?\r\n\r\nConceptually my point I guess is that it feels like we're applying a narrow solution to a pretty broad problem.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1016513198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1016657387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/476#issuecomment-1016657387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/476","id":1016657387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM48mPXr","user":{"login":"alessandrobenedetti","id":513195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti","html_url":"https://github.com/alessandrobenedetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T16:45:33Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T16:45:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
