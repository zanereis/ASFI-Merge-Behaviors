This is necessary with InterProcessSemaphoreV2 as it creates multiple subnodes beneath its lock nodes and otherwise is unreapable with ChildReaper</p>\n\n<p>    I'm a little unsure of this solution.  It definitely doesn't make sense for ChildReaper to know about the locks and leases paths for InterProcessSemaphoreV2.  This solution allows a given lock implementation to provide its schema which the ChildReaper can use to clean up for that particular lock.  Currently IPSV2 is the only lock that needs to do so, however.  While more generic than childreaper knowing about lock implementations directly, this still seems a little bruteforcey.  It also wouldn't handle the case where the schema of a lock layout isn't known statically (although they all are currently).    </p>\n\n<p>    Another approach might have been to enable childreaper to work recursively, but then it needs to know to not reap the ephemeral nodes created by the lock implementation itself.  (Perhaps simply excluding ephemeral nodes  would work, but it kind of seems like that just \"happens to make it work right\" rather than because it makes sense for the general concept of child reaping to ignore ephemeral nodes).</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/yodle/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/yodle/curator</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-173\" title=\"InterProcessSemaphoreV2 nodes not reapable\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-173\"><del>CURATOR-173</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/67.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/67.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #67</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 72aea4a30b36201fe2a673358c1e062d6b5109a7<br/>\nAuthor: David Kesler <dkesler@yodle.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-02-09T21:34:20Z</p>\n\n<p>    Adding the notion of a 'lock schema' to ChildReaper that enables it to reap both the direct children its watching and subnodes of those children.

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p>I don't see where the bug is. From what I can tell you are calling create() for a node that already exists. The most likely problem is code like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\"><span class=\"code-keyword\">if</span>(<span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span>.client.checkExists().forPath(path)!=<span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>) {\n    ....\n} <span class=\"code-keyword\">else</span> {\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span>.client.create().\n   ....\n}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>This type of check is not correct. After the call to checkExists() another client may have created the node and, so, the create() call will fail. The only safe way to handle this is to always try to create() and, if that throws NodeExists, call setData(). Or, acquire a Curator lock first.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604722210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604718756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/693#issuecomment-2604718756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/693","id":2604718756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3MTg3NTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-01T18:55:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:20:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
