Thanks for review and suggestion!\r\n\r\nFirst, I didn't know `plangenerator` module is also for tests, since it's name is confusing.\r\nAnd they cannot be a single module due to cyclic dependency (runtime-test -> runtime-master -> runtime-plangenerator).\r\n\r\nSecond, I'd also love to separate tests more clean as you pointed out, but several tests have complex dependencies as I described in the PR description.\r\nEspecially, `nemo.compiler.optimizer.pass.compiletime` tests cannot go to corresponding module (nemo-compiler-optimizer).\r\nIt's because those tests use `JobLauncher` in `nemo-client` package. `nemo-client` has dependency on `nemo-compiler-optimizer` module again, which means cyclic dependency.\r\n\r\nPlease refer

One concern is that although it's in a good direction, it doesn't completely solve the issue. There are some missing details in the issue description (my bad), but the issue expects a more sophisticated algorithm that provides a general way to check the equality between the int predicates, instead of having to provide the range of numbers manually. Maybe we could leave the `noOfTimes` parameter as a minimum range to check (with a default value), and add a bit of a logic that checks the boundaries up to a point a particular predicate changes from true to false, or the other way around and check the equality of both predicates at that boundary.\r\nWhat I've intended was to make an algorithm that works like an `equals()` method that checks the equality without requiring manual interferences.\r\nFeel free to provide questions if there's something that's not clear! 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/413768100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/413785363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/pull/106#issuecomment-413785363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/106","id":413785363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzc4NTM2Mw==","user":{"login":"arunlakshman","id":2631737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2631737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman","html_url":"https://github.com/arunlakshman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunlakshman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T07:43:25Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T07:43:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@seojangho: thanks 👍for adding the `formatter.xml` and `.editorconfig`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/413785363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/413787931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/pull/106#issuecomment-413787931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/106","id":413787931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzc4NzkzMQ==","user":{"login":"seojangho","id":8655816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho","html_url":"https://github.com/seojangho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seojangho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T07:54:28Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T07:54:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The Eclipse formatter really has lots of options! @arunlakshman Let me know if there's any room for improvement!

In that case, I think it makes sense to start the range from the number 0 (we can make this more clear in the code).\r\n\r\nTo add a bit more of an explanation, taking a look at the `LoopVertex` implementation, a loop vertex has a `maxNumberOfIterations` variable that determines the max number of how many times to repeat the iteration, and once it gets to a point where the predicate returns true, predicate taking in the `maxNumberOfIterations` variable as its parameter, it stops the loop unrolling process. (Loop unrolling process simply appends the iteration's sub-DAG before the LoopVertex, until it reaches its termination condition - maxNumber becoming 0 or predicate returning true). Therefore, thinking only about this use case it actually makes sense to simply check the range between 0 and the `maxNumberOfIterations` variable.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we trust the developer to use this function correctly, but my point about the issue is that we could make this process to be done without the developer's interference. For instance, we could maybe receive a LoopVertex with the method to extract the `maxNumberOfIterations` variable and use it as the max value of the range to check the predicates.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/414101721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/414103015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/pull/107#issuecomment-414103015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/107","id":414103015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDEwMzAxNQ==","user":{"login":"johnyangk","id":4114572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTQ1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4114572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk","html_url":"https://github.com/johnyangk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-19T04:39:06Z","updated_at":"2018-08-19T04:39:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @jeongyooneo!
