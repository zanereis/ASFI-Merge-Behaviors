Hi @caishunfeng @SbloodyS , it seems @boy-xiaozhang has some idea about adding a dependence hook to the task plugin and want to call in api server when users save task. do you have any great idea to do that?\r\n\r\nDear brothers, do you have any good ideas? My idea is to make the dolphinscheduler task parser into plugin and couple them into the task plugin. In this way, users can make their own extensions for those with task source and  task target. However, if they do so, the analysis of this work may have to be handed over to the worker, so they have to request the worker when the task is saved and when depend on recommendation, which is also more troublesome, do you have any good
