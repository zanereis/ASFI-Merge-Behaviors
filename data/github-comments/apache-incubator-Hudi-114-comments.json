Sorry for the delay, I finally got chance to look into this . \r\n\r\nYes, this will only manifest for case when index can support log files. I believe this is the problem:  We are using wrong API of FileSystemView here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/release-0.6.0/hudi-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/deltacommit/UpsertDeltaCommitPartitioner.java#L85\r\n\r\nWe don't include file groups that are in pending compaction but with Hbase Index we are including  them. With the current state of code, Including files in pending compaction is an issue.\r\n\r\nThis API \"getLatestFileSlicesBeforeOrOn\" is originally intended to be used by CompactionAdminClient to figure out log files that were added after pending compaction and rename them such that we can undo the effects of compaction scheduling.  There is a different API \"getLatestMergedFileSlicesBeforeOrOn\" which gives a consolidated view of the latest file slice and includes all data both before and after compaction. This is what should be used in \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/release-0.6.0/hudi-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/deltacommit/UpsertDeltaCommitPartitioner.java#L85\r\n\r\nThe other workaround would be excluding file slices in pending compaction when we select small files to avoid the interaction between compactor and ingestion in this case.  But, I think we can go with the first option \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/810709098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/810722159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2734#issuecomment-810722159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2734","id":810722159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDcyMjE1OQ==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-31T03:02:49Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T03:02:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leo-Iamok I have opened a PR #2746 to handle the class in flink module, so you do not need to care about that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/810722159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/810726094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2746#issuecomment-810726094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2746","id":810726094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDcyNjA5NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-31T03:13:25Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T03:13:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2746?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2746](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2746?src=pr&el=desc) (1179907) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/commit/3cab928b508be6729c9c8abe30b4beb5ddd12b04?el=desc) (3cab928) will **decrease** coverage by `42.64%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2746/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=VTTXabwbs2)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/hudi/pull/2746?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #2746       +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     52.04%   9.40%   -42.65%     \n+ Complexity     3624      48     -3576     \n============================================\n  Files           479      54      -425     \n  Lines         22804    1989    -20815     \n  Branches       2415     236     -2179     \n============================================\n- Hits          11869     187    -11682     \n+ Misses         9910    1789     -8121     \n+ Partials       1025      13     -1012     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| hudicli | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudiclient | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudicommon | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudiflink | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudihadoopmr | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudisparkdatasource | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudisync | `?` | `?` | |\n| huditimelineservice | `?` | `?` | |\n| hudiutilities | `9.40% <ø> (-60.34%)` | `0.00 <ø> (ø)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
