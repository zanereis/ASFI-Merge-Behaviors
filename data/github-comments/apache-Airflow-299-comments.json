If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581637170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581641177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2708#issuecomment-581641177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2708","id":581641177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTY0MTE3Nw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-03T22:04:46Z","updated_at":"2020-02-03T22:04:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

For complicated triggering logic like this, did you consider making another DAG that triggers this DAG with `TriggerDagRunOperator` ?

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/581977190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/582060266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7098#issuecomment-582060266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7098","id":582060266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjA2MDI2Ng==","user":{"login":"jared-martin","id":40148649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTQ4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40148649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin","html_url":"https://github.com/jared-martin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jared-martin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-04T18:53:37Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T18:53:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yuqian90 I agree with what @ChrisEverling said [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4182#discussion_r362862918), and with the folks who created the issue, \"none failed\" includes \"all skipped\", and the documentation backs that up.

It took some debugging to find this extra condition, and I still don't understand the rationale behind it.\r\n> \r\n> Why not make the current trigger rule behave as documented, and add a new one to preserve the unexpected \"none failed and not all skipped\" behavior?\r\n\r\n@jared-martin Sure. I think continuing what @TV4Fun was originally doing in this PR is also fine. However, I was pointing out in my previous comments the side-effect of making this change when e.g. when join tasks with `none_failed` trigger_rule are nested in branching logic.\r\n\r\nIf people think it's better to proceed with fixing the existing `none_failed` to match what the doc says, I would suggest we update the parts in the doc about using `none_failed` task to create join for `BranchPythonOperator`. It can no longer be a `none_failed` `DummyOperator`. It needs to be something like the following, where the join task checks the state of its parent `BranchPythonOperator` and skip itself if the parent is skipped. I would highly recommend making `create_join` a free function inside `airflow/operators/python.py` to make it more convenient for users of `BranchPythonOperator` and `ShortCircuitOperator`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import BranchPythonOperator,

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/582463980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/582467857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7312#issuecomment-582467857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7312","id":582467857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjQ2Nzg1Nw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-05T15:39:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T15:39:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am not really experienced in that part of the code (UI)?

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/582821030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/582824111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7374#issuecomment-582824111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7374","id":582824111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjgyNDExMQ==","user":{"login":"codenamelxl","id":9434559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzQ1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9434559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl","html_url":"https://github.com/codenamelxl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-06T09:56:10Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T09:56:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Failed check is about PR title.
