Add your interpreter class name to the zeppelin.interpreters property in `conf/zeppelin-site.xml.template`\n   \n   Property value is comma separated [INTERPRETER_CLASS_NAME].\n   \n   For example:\n   \n   ```\n   <property>\n   <name>zeppelin.interpreters</name>\n   <value>org.apache.zeppelin.spark.SparkInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.spark.PySparkInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.spark.SparkSqlInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.spark.DepInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.markdown.Markdown,org.apache.zeppelin.shell.ShellInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.hive.HiveInterpreter,com.me.MyNewInterpreter</value>\n   </property>\n   ```\n2. Add your interpreter to the [default configuration](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/conf/ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L397) which is used when there is no `zeppelin-site.xml`.\n3. Start zeppelin by running `./bin/zeppelin-deamon start`\n4. In the interpreter page, click the `+Create` button and configure your interpreter properties.\n   Now you are done and ready to use your interpreter.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/170763676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/170770176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/614#issuecomment-170770176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/614","id":170770176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDc3MDE3Ng==","user":{"login":"ramaswamydevarajan","id":7673174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7673174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan","html_url":"https://github.com/ramaswamydevarajan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramaswamydevarajan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T03:10:11Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T03:14:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz \nare any related to this PR ?

I assume that you, as an author, should know better. \n\nUsually the mindset we try to share here is - CI must be green for anything to be merged.  If it's not - then dedicated effort worth putting is - try to fix it i.e by collaborating with more experienced members, asking for help, etc. \n\nIf you have some spare cycles you could spend them creating a separate issues, investigating these failures and pinging the people who touched particular code before - that would be very appreciated and of the great help to the project. \n\nOtherwise best bet is to wait until somebody takes care of this one day, so you can rebase on top of that work, but this might take some time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/170785620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/170793941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/578#issuecomment-170793941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/578","id":170793941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDc5Mzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T05:09:15Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T05:09:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@corneadoug
