The statement is now grouped as ddlStatement, dmlStatement, and administrationStatement, which is more consistent with the conventional sql design.\r\n2. I reorganized the format of constant. In previous version, we had negetive integer, positive integer, usigned integer, etc. To aviod problems of longest match, we need use \"=>\" operator. This operator was widely used in previous version. I simplified the grammer definitions by just defining the integer and real numbers, regardless of the sign. No \"=>\" operators anymore. Althought, some acceptable constraints are introduced, like \"+\" is not allowed to identify a positive value.

And I totally agree with what you have noted in the guidance:\r\n> Notice: When you set TTL to some storage groups, data out of the TTL will be made invisible\r\nimmediately, but because the data files may contain both out-dated and living data or the data files may be being used by queries, the physical removal of data is stale. If you increase or unset TTL\r\njust after setting it previously, some previously invisible data may be seen again, but the\r\nphysically removed one is lost forever. **In other word, different from delete statement, the\r\natomicity of data deletion is not guaranteed for efficiency concerns.** **So we recommend that you do not change the TTL once it is set or at least do not reset it frequently, unless you are determined to suffer the unpredictability.** \r\n\r\nI want to draw attention to another point that can be easily misunderstood when using the operation `unset TTL to <storage group>`. That is, the latest insertion time of a storage group, which is the split point used to determine whether the coming data point is sequential or unsequential, will not be “recycled\" even if the data before `now()-TTL` are really deleted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/542204822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/542588874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/429#issuecomment-542588874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/429","id":542588874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjU4ODg3NA==","user":{"login":"jt2594838","id":23610645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEwNjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23610645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838","html_url":"https://github.com/jt2594838","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T08:31:05Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T08:31:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That is true.

I want to say, you can modify the content of the markdown, and replate the title of the first chapter in it...\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb/pull/450?email_source=notifications&email_token=AGFWUK3CY6AGDVHSCHPD6W3QO4Z3BA5CNFSM4JAWN4VKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOEBM7XCA#issuecomment-542768008>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGFWUK4Y5H4LUW4ST7J3YATQO4Z3BANCNFSM4JAWN4VA>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/542771372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/542953161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/435#issuecomment-542953161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/435","id":542953161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mjk1MzE2MQ==","user":{"login":"tsunghanjacktsai","id":34185019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTg1MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34185019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai","html_url":"https://github.com/tsunghanjacktsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsunghanjacktsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-17T01:09:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T01:29:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, I have no idea now about how to implement the interface which could show all devices (which is another issue) as it was not developed by me before.

This was requested change came from @jt2594838. @qiaojialin and I talked personally, then we decided to delete it.\r\n2. This was literally because every time when you new a `TsFileSequenceReader` object and its constructor would call `loadMetadataSize()` method, `loadMetadataSize()` would call `position()` method. In local mode, it actually called `FileChannel.position()` method. As we know, it was a method would move the position pointer. So questions were **Why to move the position pointer? It is really necessary to move the position pointer when I new a `TsFileSequenceReader` object?**\r\n## why to move the position pointer?\r\nLet's firstly check out TsFile structure. \r\n<img width=\"694\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-19 at 10 10 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26118649/67146402-72c89700-f2bd-11e9-8f09-112a8456799b.png\">\r\nYou can find `MetaMarker.CHUNK_HEADER=0x1` after Magic String. There is a method called `readMarker()` to read `MetaMarker.CHUNK_HEADER=0x1`.\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * read one byte from the input. <br> this method is not thread safe\r\n   */\r\n  public byte readMarker() throws IOException {\r\n    markerBuffer.clear();\r\n    if (ReadWriteIOUtils.readAsPossible(tsFileInput, markerBuffer) == 0) {\r\n      throw new IOException(\"reach the end of the file.\");\r\n    }\r\n    markerBuffer.flip();\r\n    return markerBuffer.get();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThere is no `position()` method in `readMarker()`. So it used to use `position()` in `loadMetadataSize()` to move the position pointer. But there are many tests and examples use `readMarker()`. After you remove `position()` in `loadMetadataSize()`, you have to use `position()` before `readMarker()`. @qiaojialin suggested me do that and I just done it. \r\n\r\n## It is really necessary to move the position pointer when I new a `TsFileSequenceReader` object?\r\nNo. Move the position pointer when you really need
