even if this deadlock occurs.

However, everytime I see deadlock, thread-dump showed that thread gets blocked while fetching data from zk and it happened multiple times at broker so, i don't believe that zk-client is failing this many times to return callback. However, I don't see any exception at that time which can give us evident to understand this issue. So, I feel there has to be an issue at pulsar app level rather zk-client level and I am looking into it to figure out actual root cause.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/466224039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/466227214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3585#issuecomment-466227214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3585","id":466227214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjIyNzIxNA==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T00:41:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T00:41:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun
