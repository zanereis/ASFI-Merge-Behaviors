I asked @rdblue to make an issue and PR so we can see if we'd like to include it.\r\n\r\nSomething I don't like is that our automated `BuildInfo` has been removed in favor of hard-coded values since Gradle cannot take advantage of the generated object from sbt. If we wanted to support a Gradle build, maybe we could have an external config file that Gradle and sbt can load and use when building? We could then either generate the `BuildInfo` class based on the config file or bundle the config file as a resource and change the `BuildInfo` class to read the config file at runtime.\r\n\r\nIs anyone interested in this? Too much work to maintain the two? I know that Apache Spark had support for both Maven and sbt (I think they still do), but not sure if it's something we want to consider.\r\n\r\n@rdblue, do you have any _pros_ to including this other than you and/or your team are using Gradle?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/282064295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/comments/282493890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/pull/96#issuecomment-282493890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-toree/issues/96","id":282493890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjQ5Mzg5MA==","user":{"login":"mariusvniekerk","id":73973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk","html_url":"https://github.com/mariusvniekerk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariusvniekerk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-25T16:15:49Z","updated_at":"2017-02-25T16:15:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Okay looks good to me.
