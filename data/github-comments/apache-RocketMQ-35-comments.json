It is also very helpful for users to select or update RocketMQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually，there are quite a few application systems using Alibaba-rocketmq version under 3.5.8.For this users, they just only referenced fastjson,netty-all,slf4j-api.And it is difficult to let they to update rocketmq client, but acl and message trace is necessary.For those who is using ant, it will be impossible...\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than，even if the version used by the user is 4.x, the three-party package referenced by the client is not controlled.

@ChaosYjh try to setInstanceName when creating producer，and recommend to create one producer to send different topic messages, and it would be nice if you can proposal a PR to polish this

Set the number of queues for topic to 1 \r\n2. Message consumer uses MessageListenerOrderly \r\n\r\nPS： my deployment: two master brokers\r\n\r\nbut i found that there is still a problem, the message is not consumed in order, such as the output below：\r\nqueue0,/broker1,Hello RocketMQ 1\r\nqueue0,/broker1,Hello RocketMQ 3\r\nqueue0,/broker1,Hello RocketMQ 5\r\nqueue0,/broker1,Hello RocketMQ 7\r\nqueue0,/broker1,Hello RocketMQ 9\r\nqueue0,/broker2,Hello RocketMQ 0\r\nqueue0,/broker2:10933,Hello RocketMQ 2\r\nqueue0,/broker2:10933,Hello RocketMQ 4\r\nqueue0,/broker2:10933,Hello RocketMQ 6\r\nqueue0,/broker2:10933,Hello RocketMQ 8\r\n\r\nas mentioned above, for a queue, in the case of two brokers, if no broker is specified in producer, the consumer client seems to see two queues, which are queue 0 stored on broker1 and queue 0 stored on broker2. then consumers will pull messages from these two queues when they consume, if the broker2 network delay or load is too high, the above output will occur.\r\n\r\nit seems that only when the producer specifies a queue, a broker, and the consumer uses messagelistenerorderly to ensure that the messages are consumed sequentially.\r\n\r\nplease tell me what i understand, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/503456305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/503458668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1275#issuecomment-503458668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1275","id":503458668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzQ1ODY2OA==","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T08:20:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T08:20:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
