I've rethought about it and it could be good to expose TEST-TIMEOUT-MS because there're various development environments which may take more time to process.<br/>\n    In addition, developer can present 3rd parameter from tracked-wait to multiple of TEST-TIMEOUT-MS, which can be flexible than current.<br/>\n    I cannot think system env. before you mentioned.

I thought I remembered seeing it do that before.</p>\n\n<p>    Since it's not happening, the message ends up getting lost - neither failed nor acknowledged.  So maybe after printing the big nasty error message, I should still handle the message in some way - either ack() it or just let it keep retrying?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612489943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612488633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4329#issuecomment-2612488633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4329","id":2612488633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0ODg2MzM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-03T07:26:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:05:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/280\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/280</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-487\" title=\"Remove storm.cmd, no need to duplicate work python runs on windows too.\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-487\"><del>STORM-487</del></a> Let bin/storm compatible with Windows</p>\n\n<p>    I modified bin/storm to be compatible with Windows.<br/>\n    bin/storm script didn't take care of OS specific chars, so I've modified it.</p>\n\n<p>    ps.
