Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available).

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available).

The code looks pretty good, my comments are about readability mostly. I am not familiar with this part of the codebase; perhaps a more experienced reviewer would understand faster. But in general I really prefer the code to be as simple and clear as possible.

Some of my suggestions may be not strictly necessary, like reverting the negated variables \"cannotTransform\", but I think they do really help.
