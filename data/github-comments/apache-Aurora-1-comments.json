Thank you very much for the feedback, it helped me realize rollback was not exactly a mirror image of roll forward. I've addressed that with this update.\r\n\r\nEdit- Forgot to mention. I've also added a conversion from the old thrift schema to the new thrift schema upon receiving the request. \r\n\r\nYou had asked me to remove it in a previous review but we realized (when we tried to deploy this patch internally) that we can't upgrade clients as quickly in our usecase. Since we use a go library for communicating to Aurora, we have to recompile all our programs with support for the new thrift schema. These few lines of code I added back would provide a pretty seamless transition from 0.21.0 to 0.22.0 while clients are updated and would be removed in 0.23.0.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit of kicking the upgrade down the road a bit but the buffer gives us time to upgrade client

Once we have the uid inside of the container, we create a vagrant user inside the container with the same uid.\r\n\r\nNext, the python script, http_example.py chown `/mnt/mesos/sandbox` to the uid of vagrant to allow the `aurora ssh` process to be able to read it (if the uid of the host matches the uid of the user in the container, the local user will have access to files created in the bind mount with the same uid). Ideally, the path would be figured out dynamically.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to do it in a way that lets us recycle http_example.py for both non-docker based tasks and docker based tasks.\r\n\r\nTested this all out locally and works fine but I'm fine tuning some details. If you have any ideas as to how to do the chown without affecting the non-docker tasks I'm all ears ðŸ˜ƒ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/429174966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/429758817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/aurora/pull/44#issuecomment-429758817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/44","id":429758817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTc1ODgxNw==","user":{"login":"thinker0","id":357785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzc4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0","html_url":"https://github.com/thinker0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thinker0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T08:45:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T08:45:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Uploaded.\r\nhttps://bintray.com/thinker0/mesos/mesos-executor-egg","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/429758817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/429775655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/aurora/pull/42#issuecomment-429775655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/42","id":429775655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTc3NTY1NQ==","user":{"login":"StephanErb","id":483730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzczMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanErb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanErb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T09:37:33Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T09:37:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rdelval sorry for the delay.

Since we were only testing for the contents of a file here I tried to come up with a fix that let's us do that (we we're never able to check for write permissions as per comments [here]( https://github.com/apache/aurora/blob/master/src/test/sh/org/apache/aurora/e2e/test_end_to_end.sh#L717) for what I can only assume are similar reasons.

Maybe my assumption on Docker was wrong here.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's the way that docker is bind mounting the sandbox? \r\n\r\n~~From the code I see we chown mesos dir, but in docker what we really need to do is chown the MESOS_SANDBOX dir.~~\r\n\r\n~~This is a sample of the var variables set inside the docker container:~~\r\n\r\n```\r\nMESOS_SANDBOX=/mnt/mesos/sandbox\r\nMESOS_DIRECTORY=/var/lib/mesos/slaves/de6bc8b8-f9cd-48a8-b4aa-8f0461ed12ce-S0/frameworks/de6bc8b8-f9cd-48a8-b4aa-8f0461ed12ce-0000/executors/thermos-vagrant-test-http_example_docker-0-47b23e33-453c-47ce-8ec1-7996723ddb85/runs/919cb361-c46b-4caf-9279-a623a242c9a0\r\n```\r\n~~In this case MESOS_DIRECTORY is not bind mounted so chowning it ends up not doing anything for us outside the container. \r\nTherefore, I think the behavior is different from Mesos containers. In docker containers, MESOS_SANDBOX is what we want to chown (because it is bind mounted there) and not MESOS_DIRECTORY  + \"sandbox\".~~\r\n\r\n~~So I think a patch is needed to handle this behavior in docker containers~~\r\n\r\nEdit- This assumption turned out to not be true.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/429971376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/430015151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/aurora/pull/43#issuecomment-430015151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/43","id":430015151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDAxNTE1MQ==","user":{"login":"ridv","id":1643994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1643994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv","html_url":"https://github.com/ridv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ridv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T21:13:23Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T21:13:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @StephanErb.

I'm unable to replicate this exact error but I figured out where it comes from.\r\n\r\nUsing `'''` for multi line strings in python means everything (even whitespace) is included as part of the string.\r\n\r\nSo the following happens when setting the variable like that:\r\n```\r\n>>> cmdline = '''cat <<EOF > .thermos_profile\r\n...                export RESULT=hello\r\n...                EOF'''\r\n>>> print(cmdline)\r\ncat <<EOF > .thermos_profile\r\n               export RESULT=hello\r\n               EOF\r\n```\r\nYou can notice that there spaces before export and `EOF` are now included in the string.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately causes issues because bash is looking for an exact delimiter match of `EOF` to signal the end of the data being passed into the arg. Since there's spaces, bash gets confused.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution to this is to change:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsetup_env = Process(\r\n  name = 'setup'\r\n  cmdline = '''cat <<EOF > .thermos_profile\r\n               export RESULT=hello\r\n               EOF'''\r\n)\r\n```\r\nTo:\r\n```\r\nsetup_env = Process(\r\n  name = 'setup',\r\n  cmdline = \r\n'''cat <<EOF > .thermos_profile\r\nexport RESULT=hello\r\nEOF'''\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will yield the expected results. Notice I also included a comma at the end of name ='setup'\r\n(without it the job parsing will fail.)\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing this out I can't believe the documentation has been around this long and no one else has hit this. \r\n\r\nIf you could please test my suggestion out and report back if it works for you we'd really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nApologies for taking so long to get to testing this, appreciate you taking the time to submit a patch to us!\r\n\r\nIf it does work, do you mind changing up your patch to use that solution?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/524476788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/comments/524518027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/aurora/issues/56#issuecomment-524518027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/aurora/issues/56","id":524518027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDUxODAyNw==","user":{"login":"mauri","id":752525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/752525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri","html_url":"https://github.com/mauri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-24T04:12:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-24T04:12:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rfuerst87 the \\u003d displayed in the dump seems to be an artifact of the struct serializer.

However there is a bit of pain with Thrift: Aurora's API require `Set`s in many places and this requires Thrift objects to be hashable in Python. Unfortunately Thrifts generated code by default comes without suitable hash methods for Python 3.\r\n\r\nWe have resorted to this nasty hack for now: \r\n```\r\n# With python 3 objects need a hash method to put them inside of sets. This was not the\r\n# case in python 2. We monkeypatch a hash method on to the the thrift objects to make them\r\n# compatible with python 3 code without having to make any changes to the thrift api\r\n# itself.\r\ndef __hash__(self):\r\n    return hash(self.__class__) ^ hash(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nsetattr(Resource, \"__hash__\", __hash__)\r\nsetattr(Metadata, \"__hash__\", __hash__)\r\nsetattr(Constraint, \"__hash__\", __hash__)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrift have a few options to change how code is generated. This might be something worth exploring.
