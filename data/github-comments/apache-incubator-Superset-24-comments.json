been thinking about this functionality as well. \nTwo thoughts:\n1. **Implementation:**  I'm not sure if we need to have a table for storing results. Is there a concurrency reason for doing this other than sharing the data? The `multiprocessing` library has a thread-safe Queue class for this. This way we don't need to write to db every query.\n2. **Generalization:** We can continue to use the pandas `read_sql_query`. This is better for performance instead of having to convert our Result to a df. The thing is that each DBAPI (sqlite3, psychopg, pyhive, etc.) has different functions for issuing a \"cancel\" to the respective db (`interrupt()` for sqlite, `cancel()` for hive, etc.) So I was thinking we could have a dict that maps db type to a function which does the cancelling.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nCurrently, I have a branch with cancel working with sqlite, and I'm working to generalize it for other backends. I'll try to have something pushed by today\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/233487872/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/233508127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/769#issuecomment-233508127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/769","id":233508127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzUwODEyNw==","user":{"login":"chejinye","id":20102032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTAyMDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20102032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye","html_url":"https://github.com/chejinye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chejinye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T01:42:56Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T01:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I solved this problem.not use  'caravel runserver -d'  to start,\nlike this:\nnohup gunicorn -w 8 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 caravel:app >> /tmp/caravel.log 2>&1 &\n\n@shkr \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/233508127/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":3,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/233584322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/333#issuecomment-233584322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/333","id":233584322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzU4NDMyMg==","user":{"login":"bmogili-involve","id":19686997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg2OTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19686997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve","html_url":"https://github.com/bmogili-involve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmogili-involve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T09:51:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T09:51:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I cannot install caravel on my windows system.

for the late reply.\n\nThe table I used does not store the data result. It stores the query ID/handler ID that allows anyone to retrieve the query in the backend database and then cancel it. Because we will have to server caravel with multiple gunicorn workers to allow multiple clients connection at the same time. The request from clients should be RESTful. That means the cancel request sent by clients should have a certificate or ID that enable server to retrieve the query again. Therefore, I added a table in caravel's db to look up the query ID. The information shared by server and clients regardless of the state is the username that has been logged in, so I used that as the key to find the query ID. \n\nI am really interested in the dict that maps db to a function, if we have that function, we can call the cancel function request by any clients. And I have question that where should we put the dict? If I am serving caravel with multiple gunicorn workers, it definitely cannot be placed at only one worker because every client should have access to it in order to cancel the query correctly. I am not sure which part of the caravel is run as a single layer in gunicorn server but that part should be where we put the dict you designed. Is that correct?\n\nAlso, do you have the link to the branch you mentioned? I cannot find it in the airbnb/caravel repo. I will return to work on this function soon.

I have three questions:\n1. Is the username a unique enough identifier? What if I opened explore in two tabs and ran two queries?\n2. What db-api are you using for your branch? I can't seem to find documentation for the cancel function you're calling (specifically the argument you're passing in)\n3. The new table seems specific to the db-api, I wonder how we can generalize this? For [sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.interrupt) and [postgres](http://pythonhosted.org/psycopg2/connection.html?highlight=cancel#connection.cancel) it seems we need to get the same connection object that issued the query. If we can figure out a way to share that object then the map below would work.\n\nThe map would just look something like this:\n\n```\ncancel_map = {\n    'sqlite': lambda conn: conn.interrupt(),\n    'postgresql': lambda conn: conn.cancel(),\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWhere `conn` is the connection object of the db-api\n\nI was having trouble with a solution for question 3, which is why I didn't push my branch. It doesn't have anything too compelling anyways.

question 1, yes, that is also one of my concern. By using username as unique identifier it will allow each user to only run one query at a time. However, I did not find any other better identifier for now. It is possible can actually send the query ID (or encoded identifier if there is security concern) to the clients and let them use it when the send the cancel request but that will largely change the code base. \n\nFor question 2, sorry I still have no time to do the documentation yet, but the function that will run when cancel request is received is at [here](https://github.com/joshwalters/caravel/blob/cancelQuery/caravel/views.py#L1278-L1297). The dp-api cancel function is [here](https://github.com/axeisghost/PyHive/blob/cancel_operation/pyhive/hive.py#L149-L164). The original PyHive connector does not provide a good RESTful service for cancel.\n\nFor question 3, the cancel_map is good idea, but first we have to find a place to share it to every client. We could make it a global field in models.py, that probably will work. Assuming that we have the place to share the map, we will have to have the connection object that client used to execute the query and then find out the lambda function from the map. I am not sure how the connection objects will be saved when multiple-worker gunicorn server is used. Is it possible that the cancel function in cancel_map takes in query ID/certificate as a parameter so that the db-api can retrieve the query to cancel? Although it seems most of the db-api did not provide this kind of service. (that's why I added a new cancel method in PyHive connector).\n\nProbably there is a way to store the connection object that client used to execute the query. If that exists, query ID will be not necessarily and the way to do it can be a lot more generalized. Do you have idea to do it, especially for the case when caravel is served with multiple-worker gunicorn server?\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/233801205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/233824878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/700#issuecomment-233824878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/700","id":233824878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzgyNDg3OA==","user":{"login":"CaraWuu","id":20318210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzE4MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20318210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu","html_url":"https://github.com/CaraWuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaraWuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T02:51:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T02:51:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OIC,I've tried this before.

So when the cancel request comes in we can't access the connection from the query request. Unless we can write cancel functions like the one you wrote in pyHive for each DB-API, I don't think there is a clean way to implement a general Cancel button.\n\nHowever, as a simpler task, perhaps we could just let the server timeout long requests and make sure we clean up the connection associated with the query (using the cancel_map)? That could all be done in the same request so we don't need to share a connection. Then in the UI we can allow users to continue running other queries while the other one times out. This of course comes with the problem of a user clicking query many many times in a row and opening a lot of connections at once. Perhaps we could limit the number of open connections they have. \n\nI'm just thinking out loud here, I'd love to hear your
