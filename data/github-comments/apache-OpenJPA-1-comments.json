i'm not following that last statement. Let me try to explain a bit more my thought andlet see where we don't align:\r\n\r\n1. in DataSourceFactory you can test rawDs.getClass().getName() (there are a few dbcp impl) or if you prefer to tolerate children we can alwaysuse  try { loadClass(base).isInstance(rawDs)} catch NoClassDefFoundError | ClassNotFoundException ignore) {} pattern\r\n2. then we just have to maintain a mapping between properties and setters:\r\n\r\n    private final Map<String, Map<String, String>> mappingPerClass = new HashMapString, Map<String, String>() {{\r\n         put(\"dbcp class name\", new HashMap<String, String>() {{\r\n            put(\"connectionUsername\", \"username\");\r\n            put(\"driver\", \"driverClassName\");\r\n         }}\r\n    }}\r\n\r\n\r\netc... (feel free to directly use setter names instead of field name if more relevant)\r\n\r\nthis way we are loosely coupled and don't require at all dbcp. The alternative is to make dbcp optional and have a small indirection \"DataSourceFactoryHandler\" with accept(Object instance) and map(properties)\r\n\r\ndoes it sounds better this way?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/comments/438555556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/comments/439294545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openjpa/pull/24#issuecomment-439294545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openjpa/issues/24","id":439294545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTI5NDU0NQ==","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-16T06:22:07Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T06:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rmannibucau
