thank you for explaining!\n\nSo we are talking about WS API to fetch full notebook state from the history by it's revision? Wich on client-side looks like [websocketMsgSrv.getNoteRevision($routeParams.noteId, $routeParams.revisionId);](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/3bd94ddc77ef9f9853ae978bf024d206378f16ba/zeppelin-web/src/components/websocketEvents/websocketMsg.service.js#L175)\n\nAnd on the back-end is a [NOTE_REVISION](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/36a7e38ffd6af614ad770a6e23ec1fd98a90c809/zeppelin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/socket/NotebookServer.java#L239) event in `NotebookServer`.\n\n@khalidhuseynov I think first of all, there is a bit of confusion here: this event is handled by\n`getNoteRevision` which looks more like `getNoteByRevision` because `Revision`, as discussed before, just represents the reference to the point in time, knowing which a full Note can be obtained, as it was back then. So `getNoteRevision` may be interpreted as a getter for Revision, rather than the Note.\n\nThen, it makes perfect sense to change the [Notebook.getNoteRevision()](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/5cdc02d3651fc8f5b7f9aa81f1d617007932b666/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Notebook.java#L366) API, both, function name AND a signature, as that is the place where actual work of retrieving the Note is done, to something like:\n\n``` java\ngetNoteByRevisionId(String noteId, String revisionId, AuthenticationInfo subject)\n```\n\nAnd this necessity, that comes from API client, at least for me, is an overriding argument in our discussion: you were right and we should adjust [NotebookRepo.get](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1254/files#diff-eea417ea15b9480afaf52ebe1f51449dR92) interface and follow your design from #1254 (and close #1277).\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/239176003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/239177689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1248#issuecomment-239177689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1248","id":239177689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTE3NzY4OQ==","user":{"login":"mwkang","id":10624086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10624086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang","html_url":"https://github.com/mwkang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T14:29:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T14:29:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz Thanks for your review.

The way I see it the pros and cons of each format can be summed up as follows:\n\n### SVG\n\nPros:\n- Vector so image quality will be consistent regardless of resolution\n- Displays more quickly for simple plots (eg. single line plots)\n\nCons:\n- Very slow for complex plots involving many data points\n\n### PNG\n\nPros:\n- Lightweight regardless of the complexity of the plot\n\nCons:\n- Does not scale to higher resolutions as well due to being raster\n- _Slightly_ slower to display simple plots\n\nTo be honest, I am not really sure which option would be best to default to. png is the default format in most matplotlib backends so that is why I have chosen it for now, but I think it's worth thinking about. Either way though I don't think the choice of default format will matter in terms of backwards compatibility as the change should be seamless for users.
