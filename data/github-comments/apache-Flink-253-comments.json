a problem with how we designed the `FileUploads` cleanup. The `AbstractHandler` cleans it up when `AbstractHandler#respondToRequest` returns. There is however no guarantee that the request has been fully processed at this point, since `AbstractRestHandler` frequently processes requests asynchronously using `CompletableFutures`. In turn we may end up deleting files _before_ they have been processed or _while_ they are being processed, leading to all kinds of failure scenarios.\r\nIt appears we can only handle the cleanup in `AbstractHandler` if we let `AbstractHandler#respondToRequest` return a `CompletableFuture` that is complete once a request has been fully processed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/399658539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/399726333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6205#issuecomment-399726333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6205","id":399726333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTcyNjMzMw==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-24T03:32:48Z","updated_at":"2018-06-24T03:32:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, @Aitozi Could you please take a look on the travis error \r\n\r\n```\r\nTests run: 2, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.014 sec <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.NFAStateAccessTest\r\ntestIterativeWithABACPattern(org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.NFAStateAccessTest)  Time elapsed: 0.009 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<20> but was:<8>\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:834)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:645)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:631)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.NFAStateAccessTest.testIterativeWithABACPattern(NFAStateAccessTest.java:193)\r\n\r\ntestComplexBranchingAfterZeroOrMore(org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.NFAStateAccessTest)  Time elapsed: 0.005 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<5> but was:<2>\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:834)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:645)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:631)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.NFAStateAccessTest.testComplexBranchingAfterZeroOrMore(NFAStateAccessTest.java:112)\r\n\r\nRunning org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.compiler.NFACompilerTest\r\nTests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.019 sec - in org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.compiler.NFACompilerTest\r\nRunning org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.DeweyNumberTest\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.01 sec - in org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.DeweyNumberTest\r\nRunning org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.sharedbuffer.SharedBufferTest\r\nTests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.004 sec - in org.apache.flink.cep.nfa.sharedbuffer.SharedBufferTest\r\nRunning org.apache.flink.cep.pattern.PatternTest\r\nTests run: 22, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.033 sec - in org.apache.flink.cep.pattern.PatternTest\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nFailed tests: \r\n  NFAStateAccessTest.testComplexBranchingAfterZeroOrMore:112 expected:<5> but was:<2>\r\n  NFAStateAccessTest.testIterativeWithABACPattern:193 expected:<20> but was:<8>\r\n\r\nTests run: 80, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 12\r\n\r\n13:21:32.852 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n13:21:32.852 [INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n13:21:32.852 [INFO] \r\n13:21:32.852 [INFO] flink-queryable-state-client-java ..................

still a bit worried about the time-align problem on recovery(because I've met serval case that would become disaster on production if we don't do the time-align on recovery. (One instance: we used the DFS to store the checkpoint data, and the DFS went into safe-mode because of some problems, we took several hours to notice that and also took some times to address the issue. After addressing DFS's issue, user's jobs were resumed and begin to run correctly. In this case, if we don't do the time-align on recovery, then user's state maybe already totally expired(when TTL <= the `system down time`)).\r\n\r\nI had a second thought on this problem, and I think maybe we could do that without a full scanning of the records, the approach is outlined below.\r\n\r\n- 1. We need to remember the timestamp when performing the checkpoint, let's say it `checkpoint_ts`.\r\n- 2. We also need to remember the timestamp when recovering from the checkpoint, let's say it `recovery_ts`.\r\n- 3. For each record, we remember it's last update timestamp, let's say it `update_ts`.\r\n- 5. And the current time stamp is `current_ts`.\r\n- 4. Then we could use the follow condition `(current_ts - update_ts) - (update_ts > checkpoint_ts ? 0 : recovery_ts - checkpoint_ts) >= TTL` to check whether the record is expired.

However I don't think it should be a general default as well because I can also find cases where this is not what a user might want. For example, TTL could be used for compliance with some user data privacy law. In this case, the law does not care about technical details like restores but only about wall-clock time, e.g. from the last user interaction. \r\nAs this is a new feature, there is also no regression and users can still go for a custom timer-based solution as alternative. I agree for some cases it makes sense to have this timeshift and also your outlined approach can make sense.

for the nice contribution. I had some comments inline. In particular three points about the serializer. I would suggest to avoid the use of raw types. I would also suggest to avoid using streaming API at least methods that can appear in hot loops (mainly copy, de/serialize) for performance reasons. I think the imperative style code will not even be (much) longer in those cases. Last, I suggest to always test new serializers via the `SerializerTestBase` because this catches many problems with little effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/400284362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/400312935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6208#issuecomment-400312935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6208","id":400312935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDMxMjkzNQ==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-26T13:41:53Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T13:41:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is a good fix for the moment.

discussed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/400804838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/400811833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6149#issuecomment-400811833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6149","id":400811833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDgxMTgzMw==","user":{"login":"etiennecarriere","id":29041215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDQxMjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29041215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere","html_url":"https://github.com/etiennecarriere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennecarriere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T20:06:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T20:06:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
