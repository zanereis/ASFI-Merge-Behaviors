Thank you very much for the effort you did put on the review! I added some changes. Also answering your question:\r\n\r\n`\r\nOne general question is whether we should switch the configuration property or keep the json.file property. Relying on the json.file property name would simplify upgrading without having to change property values. On the other hand, it is a simple manual change that seems reasonable. Thoughts?\r\n`\r\nI was thinking on this myself as well, but I deciced to use the original property name without remarking the file format because from now on, this should be the default format thus it looks both unnecessary and confusing to highlight this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1737396683/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1737494434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7800#issuecomment-1737494434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7800","id":1737494434,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5nkA-i","user":{"login":"marcelo225","id":4791314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTEzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4791314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225","html_url":"https://github.com/marcelo225","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcelo225/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-27T14:17:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T14:17:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt I created this PR to add this Nifi OIDC configuration I thought it was tricky to configure it, though.

Fixable?\r\n\r\nWell, that is disappointing :( I am on a new laptop, and I guess I didn't get all of my IntelliJ settings mapped over. Just updated my settings so that it properly organizes the imports in the future. Unfortunately I am not sure how it can be fixed at this point without a massive amount of effort, searching through each modified file and manually opening it and organizing imports. We could, perhaps, in a follow-on PR, issue an \"Organize Imports\" in IntelliJ at the root level so that we have them all in the desired order...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1739543935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1739549106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7806#issuecomment-1739549106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7806","id":1739549106,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5nr2my","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-28T15:33:50Z","updated_at":"2023-09-28T15:33:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should I comment on the fact that literally everything failed due to contrib check or you got that ;) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1739549106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1739592439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7808#issuecomment-1739592439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7808","id":1739592439,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5nsBL3","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-28T15:51:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-28T15:51:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The fixes are good/validated.
