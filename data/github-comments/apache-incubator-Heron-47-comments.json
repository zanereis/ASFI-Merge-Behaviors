Definitely we can have another API jar called storm-api-extension providing these interfaces. But then why not just call heron? \r\n- For high level APIs. I would favor for another high level APIs jar, which is on top of heron, providing features to make develpers life easier, for instance, window supports.\r\n\r\nSecond, lets make sure the goal of heron-storm-compatibility: it is designed for easy migration from storm to heron; it is **not** for providing more features: new features are in heron.\r\n\r\nIf people want heron features, they should use heron API. These interfaces do not exist in Apache Storm, and people should use these interfaces explicitly with heron Config to reflect they are using some features on Heron, rather than Storm. \r\nMixture of these two makes things ugly and hard to trace, i,.e, Hard to reason and hard to debug.\r\nAlso, even if we expose heron API features under storm namespace, it is in fact still **heron-api**, since: \r\n-  we own and maintain this part of code. \r\n- people need to bundle their projects with heron's jars.  (When people develop project with apache-storm, they will have no ways to access these APIs.)\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it can not provide more benefits than simply calling heron api. On the other hand, it increases maintainence cost.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/299621972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/299655273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1840#issuecomment-299655273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1840","id":299655273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTY1NTI3Mw==","user":{"login":"ajorgensen","id":509779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen","html_url":"https://github.com/ajorgensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajorgensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-06T17:43:46Z","updated_at":"2017-05-06T17:44:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@objmagic @kramasamy I ran the tests locally and they all pass, the failures looked to be caused by \r\n\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory(0x00000000eab00000, 40894464, 0) failed; error='Cannot allocate memory' (errno=12)\r\n#\r\n# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.\r\n# Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 40894464 bytes for committing reserved memory.\r\n# An error report file with more information is saved as:\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like the ci machines may need some more memory or is there some other recourse?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/299655273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/299658993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1842#issuecomment-299658993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1842","id":299658993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTY1ODk5Mw==","user":{"login":"objmagic","id":3656079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/objmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/objmagic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-06T18:50:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T00:05:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The issue this PR addresses is not really urgent, so we can leave this PR open until Monday when @billonahill can give his comments.

This is reasonable because those ram settings(container ram, component ram) are more concepts in Heron not in Storm. The previous way of the config works just mix concepts from heron and storm together, while now the config for storm and config for heron are separated by breaking this inheritance.\r\n\r\nBetter typing is a good idea and we do need to move toward to it. But given the fact that our users are blocked by this bug for migration now and `Duration` object introduces a lot of changes in other places, I would prefer we do those changes in another separate PR.

I still don't like the approach because I think that from a user's perspective this API:\r\n```\r\n     Config conf = new o.a.s.Config();\r\n    com.twitter.heron.api.Config.setComponentRam(conf, \"word\", ByteAmount.fromMegabytes(500));\r\n    com.twitter.heron.api.Config.setComponentRam(conf, \"exclaim1\", ByteAmount.fromGigabytes(1));\r\n```\r\nis a lot more clunky and less intuitive[1]  to a user than this API, which is the easier way to migrate to Heron IMO:\r\n```\r\n    Config conf = new o.a.s.Config();\r\n    conf.setComponentRam(\"word\", ByteAmount.fromMegabytes(500));\r\n    conf.setComponentRam(\"exclaim1\", ByteAmount.fromGigabytes(1));\r\n```\r\n1 - When migrating or writing my job, doing code inspection on the setters on `o.a.s.Config` is easier than somehow knowing that I need to now look up static setters on an otherwise unknown `c.t.h.api.Config` class.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we have way too many config-related classes already and this approach does not help with consolidation. Also I generally don't like static helper methods, especially to do OO things like building a config.\r\n\r\nAlso if the reason for this refactor is to fix the issue that was described in #1841, we should fix our setters to not call `toString` on numerical values.

What if user passes some argument with prefix `heron`? You will see the same error. And more annoyingly, this problem is not due to our mistake, not due to our users either.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that **Python 2.7 argparser module is full of crazy shit**. Excuse me again for the foul language, but if you have experience with using other command line parsers in other languages, and you have ever read through the entire documentation of argparser APIs, you have no choice but wholeheartedly agree with me. Python 3 fixed this problem by allowing a `(allow_abbrev=False)` which can give you **exact** match. But this solution to me is like fixing a wall of shit by throwing at it more shit.\r\n\r\nI have no strong opinion with @kramasamy's suggestion of using `--`, as long as you can implement it and add comprehensive tests!
