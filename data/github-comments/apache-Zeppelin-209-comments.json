I've found an issue related with classpaths during manual testing, and I need some help in designing architecture here. I've addresed this question to @zjffdu, but haven't received an answer, so I'll repost it here:\r\n\r\nI have a problem related with Kotlin interpreter and dependencies resolution. Please give me some advice.\r\nWe run the compilation in the same process the interpeter runs. That's why classpath which is resolved by artifacts specified in interpreter options interfers with classes in interpreter's shaded jar, and it eventually leads to NoClassDefFoundError and similar exceptions during compilation. It happens if, i.e. some of dependencies transitively depend on kotlin-stdlib of lower version than is used in shaded jar. I see two possible options of fixing this issue:\r\nChange interpreter calling architecture. Now this command is built inside bin/interpreter.sh  and eventually looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n/etc/alternatives/jre/bin/java \r\n -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 \r\n -Dlog4j.configuration='file:///etc/zeppelin/conf/log4j.properties' \r\n -Dlog4j.configurationFile='file:///etc/zeppelin/conf/log4j2.properties' \r\n -Dzeppelin.log.file='/var/log/zeppelin/zeppelin-interpreter-kotlin-shared_process-zeppelin-ip-172-31-24-244.log' \r\n -Xms1024m -Xmx2048m \r\n -cp \":/usr/lib/zeppelin/local-repo/kotlin/*:\r\n /usr/lib/zeppelin/interpreter/kotlin/*::\r\n /usr/lib/hadoop-lzo/lib/*:\r\n /usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-aws.jar:\r\n /usr/share/java/Hive-JSON-Serde/hive-openx-serde.jar:\r\n /usr/share/aws/aws-java-sdk/*:\r\n /usr/share/aws/emr/emrfs/conf:\r\n /usr/share/aws/emr/emrfs/lib/*:\r\n /usr/share/aws/emr/emrfs/auxlib/*:\r\n /usr/share/aws/hmclient/lib/aws-glue-datacatalog-spark-client.jar:\r\n /usr/share/aws/sagemaker-spark-sdk/lib/sagemaker-spark-sdk.jar:\r\n /usr/lib/zeppelin/interpreter/zeppelin-interpreter-shaded-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" \r\n org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.remote.RemoteInterpreterServer \r\n 172.31.24.244 36895 \"kotlin-shared_process\"\r\n```\r\n(splitted lines for better readability)\r\nI suggest not to pass `/usr/lib/zeppelin/local-repo/kotlin/`  path as classpath, but pass it as an option, smth like\r\n```\r\n/etc/alternatives/jre/bin/java \r\n -cp \"/usr/lib/zeppelin/interpreter/kotlin/*::\r\n /usr/lib/hadoop-lzo/lib/*:\r\n /usr/lib/hadoop/hadoop-aws.jar:\r\n ...\r\n /usr/lib/zeppelin/interpreter/zeppelin-interpreter-shaded-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\" \r\n org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.remote.RemoteInterpreterServer \r\n 172.31.24.244 36895 \"kotlin-shared_process\" \"interpreterClasspath=/usr/lib/zeppelin/local-repo/kotlin/*\"\r\n```\r\nand add a logic to process it in RemoteInterpreterServer\r\n2. Compilation may be run in a separate process (not in separate thread, like it's done now), and classpath may be filtered in Kotlin interpreter itself\r\n3. Any other option you suggest\r\nThanks in advance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/665510330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/665555099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3851#issuecomment-665555099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3851","id":665555099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTU1NTA5OQ==","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-29T09:35:11Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T09:35:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > > > @conker84\r\n> > > > Please remove the `zeppelin-web/package-lock.json` out of this PR.

Regarding your problem, I don't quite understand it. The purpose we create zeppelin shaded interpreter jar is to avoid conflict with interpreter's dependencies. e.g. we support multiple spark versions, and each spark version has different dependencies, so we don't want zeppelin's dependencies conflict with spark's dependencies. That's why we introduce the zeppelin shaded interpreter jar. Now you are saying that kotlin depends on zeppelin shaded interpreter, this is what I don't understand, kotlin itself should use its own dependencies instead of zeppelin shaded interpreter.
