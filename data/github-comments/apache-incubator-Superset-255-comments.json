You will find it does use a `mainColor` variable (ie the colorPicker) in the linear gradient.\r\n\r\nThe source code is pretty straightforward if you want to read it here: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/blob/484d63993b81d593183f1f1a2b8f9d91aeef310f/packages/superset-ui-legacy-preset-chart-big-number/src/BigNumber/BigNumber.jsx#L207\r\n\r\nAs you can see it's tightly coupled with the AreaSeries chart from @data-ui/xy-chart.
