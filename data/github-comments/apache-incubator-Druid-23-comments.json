It would be nice to make tasks more restartable in the future. I think when we rework segments announcements to use a gossip protocol or something that doesn't involve ZK, the same logic can be used for tasks. For hadoop index tasks, a restart of the task can just mean starting things over. For a realtime index task, the task can behave the same way as a realtime node restarting. This of course, requires the realtime index task to read from Kafka. I think more discussions and proposals and required for those changes. Just some food for thought right now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/109367697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/109370336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1417#issuecomment-109370336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1417","id":109370336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTM3MDMzNg==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-05T17:28:27Z","updated_at":"2015-06-05T17:28:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@gianm,

was asked to put in a bit more context on when it is ok to inject the injector.  There was a comment I made on another PR made by @drcrallen \n\n> One of the primary benefits of DI is that you get objects which are defined in terms of their dependencies. This constructor is making the statement that a KafkaExtractionManager depends on the entire global state of the process (i.e., the Injector), which is incorrect.\n> \n> The proper way to work with DI is to define the object depending directly on its dependencies and then setup your bindings so that the proper things get sent in\n\nI made this comment because `KafkaExtractionManager` is a class that is business logic.  It is something that would exist even if we weren't using Guice for DI.  In that case, building the dependency on the `Injector` means that `KafkaExtractionManager` can only ever be instantiated with Guice.  It also means that the Guice injector passed in must be able to create whatever instances that `KafkaExtractionManager` _might_ ask for, which can be a moving target.  Given that it is business logic, it should only really depend on other business logic objects.  If we wanted to replace Guice with something else, it would be annoying to tease apart this chunk.\n\nIn this case, we are dealing with `AbstractHttpClientProvider` which is a Guice `Provider` instance.  Meaning that it is used by the Guice subsystem in order to inject an `AbstractHttpClient`.  The business logic piece (`AbstractHttpClient`) depends on other business logic objects, but in order to connect up the various dependencies correct, we need the `injector` in the `Provider`.  In this case, the `injector` is being used by Guice and never leaks out of the Guice system.  So, even if we were to swap out Guice, it would mean that this `Provider` would go with it so it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nIn general, it should always be possible to \"new\" up business logic objects.  Once you get that setup done, then you go to your DI system (Guice in our case) and figure out how to make DI do the right thing.\n\nHopefully that makes more sense now?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/110075383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/110082999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1409#issuecomment-110082999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1409","id":110082999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDA4Mjk5OQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-08T17:24:59Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T17:24:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"in my mind, switching to indexmerger instead of maker should be just changing some calls.
