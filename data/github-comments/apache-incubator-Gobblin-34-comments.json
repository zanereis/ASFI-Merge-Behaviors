I've fixed the failure by adding a customized Matcher for\nCollectionEquals.\n\nclass CollectionEquals extends ArgumentMatcher<Collection> {\n\n  private final Collection _expected;\n\n  public CollectionEquals(Collection expected) {\n    _expected = expected;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean matches(Object actual) {\n    return CollectionUtils.isEqualCollection((Collection) actual, _expected);\n  }\n}\n\nIt took me a while to figure out how to fix this. I feel like other people\nmay experience the same issue. So this could be moved to a better place.\n\nThanks,\nChen\n\nOn Tue, Nov 15, 2016 at 9:50 AM, Chavdar Botev notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Can you have a look at the travis results?
