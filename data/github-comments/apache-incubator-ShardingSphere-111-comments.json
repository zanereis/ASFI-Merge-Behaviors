How to know which one with data, and which one without data? If you know the data with its month is 3, you can direct query with `select * from  t_msg_20_3 where ...`, ShardingSphere support this sql.\r\n2. As a middleware for generic usage&scenario, each one of 12 sharding tables is the same to ShardingSphere engine, no one is specially prior of others. If in your business semantics, they have an order to process one by one, I suggestion in native sql way. And Actually broadcasting 12 sharding tables will be parallelly query and merged, it's faster than one by one queries for several times.\r\n\r\nIn our further plan, query optimization is a big

Or split two sql, query from a with 123, and then query from b with sharding-key","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/604803764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/604804372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/234#issuecomment-604804372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/234","id":604804372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDgwNDM3Mg==","user":{"login":"brzone","id":7804031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDQwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7804031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone","html_url":"https://github.com/brzone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brzone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T04:08:25Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T04:08:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"广州餐道信息科技有限公司 https://www.can-dao.com/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/604804372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/604804638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4832#issuecomment-604804638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4832","id":604804638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDgwNDYzOA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T04:09:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T04:09:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fantacy2001 Hi, could you tell us what is the solution of your Issue?
