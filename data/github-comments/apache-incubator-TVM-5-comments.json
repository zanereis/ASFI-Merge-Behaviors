In order to get a good autotuned kernels, there are two essential parts\r\n\r\n- A large enough space of schedules to cover the state of art techniques in handcrafting kernels for various hardware backends (multi-core cpu, gpu etc)\r\n- An auto tuner that can effectively explore the space.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the project so far has been on part one, because if the schedule space is not good enough,  we never get the comparable performance, however clever the tuner is.  A design of a good auto-tuner is also deeply tied with what is the candidate space of search and cost model to use.\r\nThis is one of the main problem we try to solve in tvm. There was a quite a a lot of heavy lifting to close in this gap and I think we are getting quite a lot lessons on what need to be done in here.\r\n\r\nWith the scripts API we have, it is pretty straight forward to get some quick auto-tuning scripts for the workloads we care, which is the techniques we use to get some of the optimized kernels. So in that sense we already are able to do auto tuning and get good results\r\n\r\nA more principled auto tuner is on our roadmap.
