In the SQL parse progress, ANTLR recognizes ‘5’ as a Number type;\r\n2. The most suitable type corresponding to ‘5’ is Integer, so it becomes Interger;\r\n3. Although your table field type is bigint, meta data has not been used during parse progress, so it has not been converted to Long type.\r\n4. The sharding algorithm specifies that Long is required, so a conversion exception occurs.\r\n\r\nI think this problem needs to be corrected. Before that, you can also temporarily solve this problem by declaring the parameter as ‘Comparable’:\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String doSharding(final Collection<String> availableTargetNames, final PreciseShardingValue<Comparable<?>> shardingValue) {\r\n        for (String each : availableTargetNames) {\r\n            if (each.endsWith(String.valueOf(Long.valueOf(shardingValue.getValue().toString()) % 2 + 1))) {\r\n                return each;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/921540329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/921541498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/12513#issuecomment-921541498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/12513","id":921541498,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M427Zt6","user":{"login":"menghaoranss","id":60651792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUxNzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60651792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss","html_url":"https://github.com/menghaoranss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menghaoranss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T06:44:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T06:44:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RaigorJiang reproduced, I will fix it asap, thanks for your feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/921541498/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/921543048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/12386#issuecomment-921543048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/12386","id":921543048,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M427aGI","user":{"login":"taojintianxia","id":4112856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTI4NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4112856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia","html_url":"https://github.com/taojintianxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taojintianxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T06:48:06Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T06:48:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @taojintianxia ,\r\n> Can you take a look?
