I understand your concern, as ```DisruptorQueue``` plays an important role in Storm.</p>\n\n<p>    Following your suggestion, I have done performance test using <a href=\"https://github.com/yahoo/storm-perf-test\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/yahoo/storm-perf-test</a>. As expected, the results show that the new metrics do not introduce noticeable overhead.</p>\n\n<p>    Environment:</p>\n\n\n<p>      Factors | Configurations<br/>\n    ------------ |

@HeartSaVioR, \n\nI am glad to explain the mechanism of RateTracker as follows.\n\nIn general, RateTracker provides a way to monitor the rate of certain event. We notify RateTracker upon the occurrence of the event by calling `notify()` method, and call `reportRate()` to retrieve the instantaneous rate of the event. \n\nThe rate is calculated as `counts of occurrence` /  `time`. As RateTracker reports instantaneous rate, it only maintains the counts of occurrences within a given period of time as specified by `validTimeWindowInMils`. This is implemented by dividing the  `validTimeWindowInMils` into `numOfSlides` time slides and employing a timer to periodically (every `validTimeWindowInMils`/ `numOfSlides` milliseconds) clean the count in the oldest time slide.\n\nFinally, RateTracker is very efficient. First, `notify()` only does addition on a count and thus can be finished within few CPU cycles. Second, the update to the counts is also light-weight and only happens periodically, e.g., every 1 or 2 seconds. Third, all the instances of RateTracker share the same timer, avoiding using too many threads.\n\nIf you have further question, please let me know.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/138027523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612593395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4845#issuecomment-2612593395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4845","id":2612593395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTMzOTU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-06T02:14:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:57:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user wangli1426 commented on the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/716#issuecomment-138027523\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/716#issuecomment-138027523</a></p>\n\n<p>    Hi @HeartSaVioR, </p>\n\n<p>    I am glad to explain the mechanism of RateTracker as follows.</p>\n\n<p>    In general, RateTracker provides a way to monitor the rate of certain event.
