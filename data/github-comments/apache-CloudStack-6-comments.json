-  Sure. I was testing 4.5 today and the awsapi service did not work for me, after wasting almost 2 hours to make it work, I tried ec2stack which worked out of the box. I thought it would be a good idea to get rid of it and promote ec2stack :)\n\nI’ve split the changes in 3 commits to make it easier to rebase/merge. I’ll keep this open and hope to merge it next week but am interested in merge it now to avoid rebasing efforts again.
