seeing what I think could be a side effect of this issue, and I'd like a little more info on what was changed in behavior for 1.7.1.\nIn my case, we use a XCOM and I noticed it was (in my opinion) being erroneously cleared. Getting to the root of how it was cleared, I see the task was re-run in a similar \"no-op\" state as this issue alludes to, with me seeing the `INFO` messages after the true successful scheduled task run for `Filling up the DagBag` and then another message for `Previously Succeeded`. This caused the XCOM to clear even though the task was not truly run. I think that in and of itself is a bug, but in terms of the no-op run taking place do you have an Issue you could point me to so I can see the code changes and determine if it may be what we've seen as well?

The BranchPythonOperator is `a` and the join condition `one success` is `d` below. `b` and `c` are the legs. You always need a leg. In some cases, you just need to add a dummy operator in order to have a leg.\n  a\n/    \\\nb    c\n\\    /\n  d\n\nTo give you an example, here's mine : \n\n<img width=\"770\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-05-20 03 22 36\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/581734/15416384/47b0a7de-1e3a-11e6-916f-824babe954ac.png\">\n\nIn my example, I branch at `check_for_time_to_build_model_branch_condition` and join at `wait_for_previous_hour`. I need to add a single `prejoin_preagg_dummy_job`, which is just a dummy operator, right after the branch operator -- it is `c` in the diamond diagram above.\n\nThe reason is that the first task after a branch is ALWAYS skipped. Hence, the one_success trigger rule is not evaluated. Just add a dummy operator between `verify_vm` and `delete_vm` tasks. The dummy will be skipped when appropriate and the `delete_vm` will wait until one path succeeds.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/220508777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/220511897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1528#issuecomment-220511897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1528","id":220511897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDUxMTg5Nw==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T03:59:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T03:59:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing since @aoen beat me to it: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1527\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/220511897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/220512045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1527#issuecomment-220512045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1527","id":220512045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDUxMjA0NQ==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T04:00:34Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T04:00:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Noticed the same thing as @r39132.
