Phoenix CQSI connections are by default cached for ~24 hr. In fact, the issue for the large table range scan queries that we have seen occurs after 24 hr such that multiple range scan queries get hit by performance issue. Sometimes the queries take ~5-10 min worth of time and sometimes the thread that performs meta table lookup gets interrupted. However, even after 24 hr, still significant num of queries get affected.\r\n\r\nIn the incident, what we have observed is that the base table has ~138k regions. However, the queries are being done using tenant connections. Because of the fact that we get all table regions regardless of the nature of the query, we end up spending significant time retrieving region locations and filling up the connection cache, even when the given query on the tenant view likely does not require going through more than 5-10 regions.\r\n\r\nHence, this fix would improve the performance of queries being done on the large tables (and usually tables that share more tenants are larger) significantly. I am not proposing any change to how the getAllTableRegions API is written, we can continue to follow the same pattern because HBase still does not provide API where it can take start and end key of the scan range and provide all list of region locations in single API, I can file a jira for the same as well.\r\n\r\nThe current state of the PR address the performance issues of the queries:\r\n\r\n- Range Scan\r\n- Range scan on Salted table\r\n- Range scan on Salted table with Tenant id and/or View index id\r\n- Range Scan on Tenant connection\r\n- Full Scan on Tenant connection\r\n\r\nThe only queries that should require all table region locations are the ones that need full base table scan.\r\n\r\nDoes this look good to you?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1984557213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1984753107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1848#issuecomment-1984753107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1848","id":1984753107,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs52TO3T","user":{"login":"dbwong","id":41923099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTIzMDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41923099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong","html_url":"https://github.com/dbwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-07T23:07:33Z","updated_at":"2024-03-07T23:17:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@virajjasani This change as setup minimally looks reasonable to me... one area i do think we may need to be careful on however is the single threadedness of the PhoenixCon/CQSI/HConnection...

The test code should be easy to read and verify. We need a list of mutations and then check the result CDC against this list of mutations. For example, each mutation can be modeled as a timestamp, mutation type, list of column names and list of values represented as strings. This list can be initialized when it is constructed. Creating upsert and delete statements from this mutation list should be straightforward. Comparing the result of CDC against this list also should simple. The pre and post images can be retrived from the data table using SCN connections and verified against the CDC result.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/2060428443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/2065439873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1859#issuecomment-2065439873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1859","id":2065439873,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs57HByB","user":{"login":"palashc","id":6994740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTQ3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6994740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc","html_url":"https://github.com/palashc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-18T22:39:10Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T22:39:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shahrs87 Latest test report - https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/Phoenix/job/Phoenix-PreCommit-GitHub-PR/job/PR-1859/22/testReport/\r\n`UpsertSelectIT.testUpsertSelectForAgg` passes locally.
