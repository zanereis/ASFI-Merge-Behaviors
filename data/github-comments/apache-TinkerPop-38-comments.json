- i didn't see your reply earlier i the week. i think this PR even without the build changes had problems. the PR branch wasn't building I don't think (i seem to remember @robertdale bringing that up at various points). was all that fixed? \r\n\r\nthus far we've only talked about the build changes as I thought that was the primary point of the PR so i never bothered to comment much on the changes themselves. since you ask about that now, i'd say that they are hard to evaluate as they have been submitted. Because it is one giant PR, I don't understand the reasoning for these changes. You do have some detailed comments about the changes to `TraversalStrategy` which is nice, but that body of change is terrifying to be honest. It wouldn't surprise me if that was the source of the build problems.  That sort of change to that important area of code would require its own pull request and could require a discussion on the dev list. \r\n\r\nSo, reopen this PR? - I'd say \"no\". I'd say that if you feel really strongly about these changes for some reason, then they should be broken apart into new individual PRs so that they can each be evaluated on their own merit. As a reviewer (and you need 3 committers to vote +1 for us to merge), personally I'd be much happier to see PRs that do more than add generics or reformat imports because some tool said to do it. Like, if you truly have a much better way to sort traversal strategies - wow...that would be awesome! Or if traversal strategy application was bug prone and that tool your using uncovered that and it fixed a subtle problem no one ever noticed - excellent! But, please frame your PR in that fashion so that we understand what we're exactly evaluating. Organizing your work that way will help immensely on our side.\r\n\r\nHope that helps frame my opinion on this. I'm sure someone else will chime in if they think something different.

one of the dependencies of the project has in turn a dependency on Newtonsoft.Json and wants explicitly version 9 of it and not some higher version.

This assumes that both dependencies have the same distance to the base package in the dependency graph and that they only specify the versions as minimum requirements which is the default.\r\nHowever, when one dependency wants explicitly version 9.0.0 and not a higher version, then there isn't much we can do I guess.\r\n\r\nWhen you find a solution to always get version 11.0.0 (e.g. without using a local `Nuget.config` file as that would require all developers to also adapt their local config), then great, but otherwise I suggest that we just not support those really big integers for now and postpone that as an additional feature for later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389177829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389197828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/842#issuecomment-389197828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/842","id":389197828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTE5NzgyOA==","user":{"login":"danielcweber","id":1899410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTk0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1899410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T14:56:42Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T14:56:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I might force a dependency on 11.0.0 from the unit test project itself, but I'm puzzled why it runs locally (same resolution logic should apply here), and the project explicitly depending on 9.0.0 is yet to find...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389197828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389202638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/842#issuecomment-389202638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/842","id":389202638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTIwMjYzOA==","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T15:09:51Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T15:09:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah, I also did a quick search but only found dependencies like >= 9.0.0.\r\n\r\n> but I'm puzzled why it runs locally \r\n\r\nDid you modify your Nuget.config?

and I extended the `gremlin-archetypes` section in the reference docs by splitting it into two sections: _Maven Archetypes_ and _Gremlin.Net Template_. In the future, we can add more sections when the other GLVs also get templates. `gremlin-archetypes` is now the anchor of the _Maven archetypes_ subsection.\r\nHowever for some reason the generated docs have an added comment in the last listing and I don't know how I can prevent that from happening. It looks like this:\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet new gremlin -o MyFirstGremlinProject\r\n// LAST LINE\r\n```\r\n\r\n> do you just mean that the dotnet-maven-plugin call to pack doesn't work\r\n\r\nUnfortunately not, it simply doesn't work with the dotnet CLI tool. So there really isn't anything the plugin can do to help us here. Here is [what the dotnet docs say](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates#packing-a-template-into-a-nuget-package-nupkg-file) about that:\r\n\r\n> Currently, a custom template is packed on Windows with nuget.exe (not dotnet pack). For cross-platform packaging, consider using NuGetizer 3000.\r\n\r\nI never used (or heard about) this NuGetizer and it looks a bit outdated. So I'm sceptical whether that could help us.\r\n\r\n> Maybe we could wait until dotnet toolchain supports packaging and pushing templates (is there a ticket for it?), instead of increasing the complexity of the deploy process by requiring Mono.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think that the dotnet CLI tool will support that any time soon. The ticket in question should be Nuget/home#4254. It has 20x 👍, was created over a year ago, but it doesn't look as if they wanted to address this issue in the near future.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I share your concern that we shouldn't make the build too complicated, especially for new contributors who just want to submit a PR. Shouldn't it be possible to build the .NET projects from Maven and execute their tests without having to execute the `package` phase? I just tried it with `mvn clean test`, but that didn't execute any tests to my surprise.\r\nYou mentioned that you don't want to increase the complexity of the _deploy_ process, but that already required Mono even without this PR. Or at least that's what the dev docs currently say:\r\n\r\n> For those who will release TinkerPop, it is also necessary to install Mono.\r\n\r\nWhen we decide that we don't want to add this template right now, then I could also host it from my own GitHub until `dotnet pack` works with templates. The downside with that approach is of course that it would be harder to find the template, especially for new users who need it in the first place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389629638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389991357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/861#issuecomment-389991357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/861","id":389991357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTk5MTM1Nw==","user":{"login":"robertdale","id":122206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-17T20:02:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T20:02:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/389991357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/390134695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/842#issuecomment-390134695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/842","id":390134695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDEzNDY5NQ==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-18T08:27:59Z","updated_at":"2018-05-18T08:27:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I'm late to the party, I haven't got much time during the past weeks: nice contribution @danielcweber !\r\n\r\nI'm a little concerned about the difference between serializers and deserializers supported.\r\n\r\nCan we limit the scope of this PR to types for which we support serialization and deserialization?\r\nSome of the extended types are not very popular but once we add support for them, the user base for those could grow.
