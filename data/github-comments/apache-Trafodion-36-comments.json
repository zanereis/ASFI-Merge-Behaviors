for the change Kevin. I looked at the build failures. Some hints/steps for the same:\n\nFollowing link shows the places where HPT4DataSource is being used. \nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=HPT4DataSource\n\nAs you notice dcs/util /JdbcT4Util.java  needs to be touched, along with the documentation in accessing.doc – You did touch the same file in rest/util. Maybe these files didn't get added in the commit ?\n\nAlso it would be a good idea to inform users on dev/user list of this change since applications using the datasource concept need to be modified.\n\nIf you need to look at the build failures - follow the links  from the test failure:\nhttps://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/732/\n\nLet’s say we need to check on the debug failure
