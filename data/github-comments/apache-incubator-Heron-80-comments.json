This is down from the nearly 3 hour long builds. I'm not sure what the difference was. One theory is maybe it was due to us re-running the style check on each stage of the process (build, non-flaky unit test, flaky unit test). Another theory is that by limiting the memory used and also the jobs to 25, maybe that slowed things down.

Documentation for [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). Based on a very quick look at the code removing the `asyncore` will require a complete rewrite of most of the following classes. We will need to get familiar with both libraries before attempting to work on them. It would be best to have someone familiar with both libraries onboard with this change.\r\n\r\n1. [`Heron Client`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/b7d92a99a08ad8abec35e3a8f9c7f9cae61aa741/heron/instance/src/python/network/heron_client.py)\r\nThis class inherits from `asyncore.dispatcher` and overrides a lot of the routines provided in the parent class. The bulk of the work here will be replacing the channel reading methods.\r\n\r\n2.

There should not be too many changes here.\r\n\r\n4.
