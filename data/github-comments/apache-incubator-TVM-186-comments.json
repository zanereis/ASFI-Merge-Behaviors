Besides, super large batch size is not very common, therefore creating a new schedule to handle such situations may be more convenient?\r\n\r\nI personally don't prefer adding more schedule templates for different workloads, because 1) we will end up with lots of ad-hoc schedules, and 2) we will need to tune all possible schedule templates during the already time-consuming AutoTVM process. As a result, unless the target workloads are specialized but common and widely used, I would not suggest to do so.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I was working on the `dense_large_batch` and I know that it wasn't well-polished yet. The candidates (e.g., `block_cand`) are tuning space pruning heuristics. You can firstly remove them in the template and integrate with yours to see if that works for your workloads as well as some common CV workloads with large batch sizes. Then I can later file another PR to add the candidates back.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/630521369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/630613549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5622#issuecomment-630613549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5622","id":630613549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDYxMzU0OQ==","user":{"login":"hlu1","id":14827759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14827759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1","html_url":"https://github.com/hlu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-19T06:32:46Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T06:32:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhiics,

There are two solutions:\r\n1) A simple trick is to wrap it with `std::unique_ptr`, because dmlc-core has been updated to C++ 11, but it requires no-except in destructors.\r\n2) We can use TLS trick to eliminate `dmlc::LogMessageFatal` to an empty class, and instruct the compiler to disable inline in property functions.\r\n\r\nBesides patching dmlc-core, we can change the implementation of `tvm::runtime::Array` as well as follows:\r\n1) no change (using CHECK)\r\n2) throw dmlc::Error instead of using CHECK\r\n3) throw std::runtime_error instead of using CHECK \r\n4) remove and disable the CHECK\r\n\r\nBelow are the benchmarks we did. We use `g++ -fstack-usage` to dump the stack usage information for the target function.\r\n\r\nSettings:\r\n* Compiler: g++ 5.4\r\n* OS: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n* Stack size: ulimit -s 8192\r\n* Target function: `virtual tvm::relay::Expr tvm::relay::CommonSubexprEliminator::VisitExpr_(const tvm::relay::CallNode*)`, which originally crashed this PR on a very deep network\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\n|         |  https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/615                 |  https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/613  | No patch dmlc-core |\r\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|\r\n| CHECK                    | 544 | 560             | 4656               |\r\n| throw dmlc::Error        |     | 736             | 1264               |\r\n| throw std::runtime_error |    |  480             | 1008               |\r\n| No checks (no-op)                |    | 480             | 1008               |\r\n\r\nIt is unclear right now why throwing `dmlc::Error` takes more stack space than `std::runtime_error`, although they intent to be identical.\r\n\r\nActions we plan to take:\r\n- [x] Patch dmlc-core using the aforementioned tricks. [PR 1](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/613), [PR 2](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/615).\r\n- [x] Sync this branch with dmlc-core;\r\n- [x] Bring all the checks back.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend to throw `std::runtime_error` directly, although it uses the least amount of stack space, to avoid being overly ad-hoc in error throwing/catching/reporting.\r\n\r\nCC: @yidawang @yzhliu
