likely unsupported there either.\r\n\r\nI think this rewrite is in there because \"is distinct\" could be translated to more generic constructs.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this conversion is invoked 2 ways:\r\n* a rewrite is done during `SqlToRel` phase\r\n* and there is FilterRemoveIsNotDistinctFromRule - which I guess is there because not everyone uses `sql2rel` and for those cases this transformation was not accessible - (similarily to like IN/OR translation - the file history goes back to \"reformat eigenbase\" - so I can't check the original issue to somewhat validate my assumptions)\r\n\r\nNote: as long as the cast to a non-nullable type is going away I think the original issue is addressed; the original issue arises from the fact that RexToLix translator expects to be able to get an \"executable\" tree; however in case one of the arguments is a literal null, the translation is not possible - althoght its impossible to reach the branch which is problematic.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/440966393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/441272203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/925#issuecomment-441272203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/925","id":441272203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTI3MjIwMw==","user":{"login":"asereda-gs","id":25229979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI5OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25229979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs","html_url":"https://github.com/asereda-gs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-23T15:45:55Z","updated_at":"2018-11-23T15:45:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@chadasa

on this issue: I'm recently investigating why the tests hang. The cause is that a test case [`StreamTest#testStreamToRelationJoin` ](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/ee5b2f75032aa166e4923a9c90f302811cf23bab/core/src/test/java/org/apache/calcite/test/StreamTest.java#L271) causes a sequence of rule matches repeatedly triggering forever. This is the only errored test case.\r\n\r\nI'm debugging the rule match process and haven't yet found the reason. Among the rules applied for this test case, only [`PruneEmptyRules#Union`](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/3fa29455664bec0056c436491b369e0cd72242ea/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/PruneEmptyRules.java#L75) uses `unordered` and is possibly affected by this change. But I don't think it's the problem of this specific rule. Some other unintended interactions among other rules cause this problem. I'll keep this issue updated once I found the reason.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/444031790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/444322583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/932#issuecomment-444322583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/932","id":444322583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDMyMjU4Mw==","user":{"login":"zinking","id":118241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODI0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking","html_url":"https://github.com/zinking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T01:23:41Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T01:23:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"change looks good, could you squeeze the commits into 1?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/444322583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/444835282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/898#issuecomment-444835282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/898","id":444835282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDgzNTI4Mg==","user":{"login":"zabetak","id":15013153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEzMTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15013153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak","html_url":"https://github.com/zabetak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zabetak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T11:06:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T11:06:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rubenada, it would be great if we can finalize this PR, if you find some time!
