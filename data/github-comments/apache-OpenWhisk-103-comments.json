While I agree its possible to use unique consumer groups + partitions instead of unique toipcs, I think this will be a moot point once the scheduling is done at execution time (and flexibility of NOT using partition keys can be maintained). \r\n\r\nSeparately, there's some other issues you are adding to the mix, like \"action priority\" where different actions may be queued in separate topics - currently the queues (or single queue, ultimately) operate strictly as FIFO ordering, and I don't think there is a good reason to change that based on action or kind. It may be nice at some point to allow more configuration options for prewarm/warm containers, but this is a change for invokers and not the loadbalancer, I think.

What keeps the loadBalancer loop running is,  as long as there are topic messages on the Kafka Bus \r\n ```\r\nSay, add a function, say schedule() that chooses an Invoker for a topic, in LoadBalancerService.scala,:\r\n\r\n def  scheudle(action  ExecutableWhiskAction, msg ActivationMessage){\r\n ....\r\n chooseInvoker().sendActivationToInvoker()\r\n ....\r\n\r\n //Inside above  sendActivationToInvoker() copy the following code from InvokerReactive.scala: \r\n val consumer = msgProvider.getConsumer(config, \"invokers\", topic, maximumContianers, maxPollInterval = TimeLimit.MAX_DURATION + 1.minute)\r\n val activationFeed = actotSystem.actorOf(Props {\r\n     new MessageFeed(\"activation\", logging, consumer, maximumContainers, 500.milliseconds, processActivationMessage)})\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341700155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/341704440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2913#issuecomment-341704440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2913","id":341704440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTcwNDQ0MA==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-03T13:34:09Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T13:34:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's fine, the Invoker and the Loadbalancer are two separate components though.

Markus,\r\n\r\nIn today's implementation, the \"mapping of  topic-name to invoker-id\" is referred to as \" fast-binding-of-invoker\", for performance.  As I understand, @tysonnorris's proposal is adding a bit of flexibility to this, by adding a overflow-topic as a flow-control mechanism, since by the time an action-request reaches an Invoker, the Invoker state may change. \r\n\r\nThe problem, I am trying to address is \"topic-per-invoker\" -  ie. get rid of 1-1 mapping of topic to Invoker. Partitions in the Kafka Bus are meant for addressing scalability & parallel-processing, topic is a higher-level construct like a queue. I think, with Kafka, the way to address scalability is to route a specific partition to an Invoker, dynamically - which is something that a LoadBalancer can do. In the worstcase, 1 partition has 1 action-request in it.  The LoadBalancer can put all the \"action-requests\" per Invoker to a queue, at the Invoker; Using Kafka for this communication may be a overkill. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to solution, there may be a overlap between what @tysonnorris is proposing and what I'm proposing and we can design something that addresses both. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/342050489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/342073659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2744#issuecomment-342073659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2744","id":342073659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjA3MzY1OQ==","user":{"login":"devbv","id":9463930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjM5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9463930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv","html_url":"https://github.com/devbv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T08:06:37Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T08:06:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jeremiaswerner

\r\nthank you for your comment.\r\n\r\nOh ok. understand that the deployment is always distributed but for just a local deployment all the IPs of the individual components are the local docker interface.\r\n\r\nI have 6 machines and want to create a cluster of openwhisk on them which is then controlled by a load balancer. If I follow the distributed install readme file then I would modify the hosts file and put the actual IP address of the machines instead of the local interface. But then how will the load balancing occur. Is it inbuilt in the openwhisk architecture? Also can I have many invoker for e.g. multiple on single IP?\r\n\r\nyour response is greatly appreciated.\r\nthanks and regards\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/342920567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/342921275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1785#issuecomment-342921275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1785","id":342921275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjkyMTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T18:52:46Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T18:52:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rabbah - fail any new packages created with the name `default`. regarding existing packages having the name `default` - leave them be for now?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/342921275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/342944652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2943#issuecomment-342944652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2943","id":342944652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Mjk0NDY1Mg==","user":{"login":"tysonnorris","id":1638396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzgzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1638396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris","html_url":"https://github.com/tysonnorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T20:12:30Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T20:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Consider that LoadBalancerService will be changed to generate a Publish message to be handled by a LoadBalancerActor. \r\n\r\nI understand that the replicator enables reading local writes, but the issue is that assigning ActivationEntry to an invoker (via LoadBalancerData.putActivation) is done async from testing the current assigned activations (via LoadBalacnerData.activationCountPerInvoker), so while Publish messages can be made to arrive sequentially, the invoker selection process results in futures that complete at various times (without the ability to consider the futures that were generated previously). \r\n\r\nThere would need to be a way to cause publish messages to be processed only when previous futures have reached a state of completion. \r\n\r\nI may not be stating this clearly, but is there some better way to wait for chooseInvoker() Future (+ schedule()) to complete before processing the next Publish message?

I've played around with the change and have left a few minor comments. \r\n\r\nI did the following manual resiliency test on my docker-machine deployment with two kafka containers. To get the test run successful I needed to adopt the `replicationFactor: 2` (instead of `1`). See my comment below and on the setting.\r\n\r\nPrereq:\r\n - Deploy this PR with two kafka nodes `kafka0, kafka1` in the docker-machine\r\n - Create a simple hello world action\r\n\r\nTest:\r\n1. invoke an action and expect it succeeds -> works as expected 👍 \r\n2. stop kafka0\r\n3. invoke an action and expect it succeeds -> works as expected 👍\r\n4. wait some time to let the invoker idle\r\n5. check the invoker logs to see if health pings reach the controller -> works as expected 👍\r\n6. stop kafka1\r\n7. invoke an action and expected it fails -> works as expected 👍\r\n8. start kafka1 and/or kafka0\r\n9. invoke an action and expect it succeeds again -> works as expected 👍\r\n\r\nIf we don't adjust the `replicationFactor` to `2` the topics seem to be distributed across the two nodes of the cluster. That leads to the situation where the health topic lives on just a single node and if we kill that node the controller would assume all invokers are down because invokers are not able to send the health pings to the controller anymore.\r\n\r\nFor HA and resiliency reasons I therefore vote to make the replicationFactor configurable per environment. I'am not 100% sure if the replicationFactor must be equal to the number of kafka nodes and/or if the replicationFactor has a negative impact on latency and throughput.\r\n\r\nI'll therefore further test the latency and throughput in a distributed deployment with different replicationFactors and will post the results here as datapoints.\r\n\r\nI think we need to have a automated test that checks a similar scenario I've posted above. You might want to checkout the following example to add an automated test to shoot a kafka node:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tests/src/test/scala/ha/ShootComponentsTests.scala\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks for the contribution and I'am looking forward to work with you to get this in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/343194451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/343213939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2948#issuecomment-343213939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2948","id":343213939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzIxMzkzOQ==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-09T16:40:27Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T18:08:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG3 1314 🔴 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/343213939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/343225268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2744#issuecomment-343225268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2744","id":343225268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzIyNTI2OA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-09T17:15:12Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T17:15:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great contribution, and comments! +1 to testing in Travis with a clustered kafka (as we do with controller and invoker).
