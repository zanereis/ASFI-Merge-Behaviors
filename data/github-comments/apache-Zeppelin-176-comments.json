Regarding the interpolation property, I think it might be better to use paragraph level property instead of interpreter level property.  e.g. here's what I imagine\r\n```\r\n%sql(interpolation=true)\r\nselect * from table where length > ${min_length}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3 reasons I introduce paragraph level property\r\n* interpolation has overhead, we should avoid it as possible as we can. \r\n* paragraph level property is more readable for users that once they notice this paragraph level property, it would be easy for them to know that there's interporpeter in code. In contrast, few users would notice the interpreter level setting. \r\n* paragraph level property might also be useful for other interpreters and scenarios. One case is jdbc interpreter where we already use. e.g. we use `%jdbc(hive)` to indicate this is hive sql. Another case is ZEPPELIN-3334, e.g. we can use `%spark(spark.scheduler.pool=pool_1)` to specify pool for paragraph\r\n\r\nThis paragraph level property could be done in another ticket, Will back to review more after 0.8 release.
