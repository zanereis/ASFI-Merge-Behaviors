All of those files should instead get the jQuery dependency from head.jsp which is included in all JSP files (via Struts / Tiles).  (I should have removed those references back when I added the jQuery webjar dependency.)\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier to upgrade jQuery in the future because we will only need to change `pom.xml` and `head.jsp`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/527117017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/527137717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/roller/pull/37#issuecomment-527137717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/37","id":527137717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzEzNzcxNw==","user":{"login":"adityasharma7","id":15027245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI3MjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15027245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7","html_url":"https://github.com/adityasharma7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adityasharma7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-02T12:53:33Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T12:53:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @snoopdave for the heads up :)\r\n \r\nI traced back, Js libraries import using webjars dependencies is available in master[1] & roller 6[2] but not in 5.2.x.

It uses a LinkedHashMap with a single method overridden to make it a fixed size LRU cache. It is synchronized yes, but the critical section is so small that it won't make a difference for a lot if not most deployments. I would like to see it as default tbh (I am using it for my blog).\r\n\r\nExpiringLRUCacheImpl: i am not quite sure what problem it was supposed to solve. But the current implementation only removes expired entries after a cache hit. Maybe its just there to refresh the cache if someone edits something in the db without invalidating cached item. But its basically a LRUCacheImple with expiration logic added to it - also fairly simple.\r\n\r\nIf you are running a larger blog server with high traffic you will probably disable rollers cache and have something like nginx running in front of it. A synchronized hash map with get() contention is probably the least of your problems ;)\r\n\r\nThat being said, having a CacheImpl which uses Guava's CacheBuilder would be interesting, but i can't imagine it would be a high priority. I might just give it a try on a rainy day - should be trivial to add, although of limited use for my own blog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/641830303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/650930980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/roller/pull/63#issuecomment-650930980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/63","id":650930980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDkzMDk4MA==","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-29T06:00:03Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T06:00:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"oops, forgot that this pull request was still open. seems like github is automatically adding new commits to PRs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/650930980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/comments/652101892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/roller/pull/63#issuecomment-652101892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/roller/issues/63","id":652101892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjEwMTg5Mg==","user":{"login":"snoopdave","id":1076693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY2OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave","html_url":"https://github.com/snoopdave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snoopdave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-30T23:34:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T23:34:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I missed this one @mbien.
