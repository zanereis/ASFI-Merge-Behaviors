Supposedly searching by timestamp should be a relatively rare operation. With LogAppendTime, the time will be similar to offset search. With CreateTime, the time cost largely depends on how the data look like. i.e. if we have to scan tons of logs, it is going to be slow, otherwise it is fast. One thing for sure is that it is going to be slower than before which did not do much except for looking at the last modification time of segment files.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/214572966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/214575681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/986#issuecomment-214575681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/986","id":214575681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDU3NTY4MQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T00:56:34Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T00:56:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SinghAsDev - ApiVersion and ApiVersions is a tiny change and no one is using the API yet (since we didn't commit yet...), I see no problems.
