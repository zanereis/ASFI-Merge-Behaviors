There is something wrong with cqOffset 52549441 of qid 4.\r\n\r\nFrom the producer log, the phyOffset is 80549937024 of cqOffset 52549441, as follow:\r\n2018-09-11 16:37:32,006 [ INFO ] MissChecker - send msg success, topic:role_change, tag:1536655040000, index:399503976, result:SendResult [sendStatus=SLAVE_NOT_AVAILABLE, msgId=0AB314D91D3F070DEA4E3710B4E7BD18, offsetMsgId=0A60706900002A9F00000012C1267F80, messageQueue=MessageQueue [topic=role_change, brokerName=syz-00, queueId=4], queueOffset=52549441]\r\n\r\nIn the recover log broker, the max phy offset is 80549937216. As the messages with fixed length 192, the laste message offset is 80549937024 whose cqoffset is 52549441.\r\n2018-09-11 16:44:11.292 INFO main - load over, and the max phy offset = 80549937216\r\n\r\nAnd I find some log else about this issue:\r\n2018-09-11 16:44:11.123 ERROR main - [BUG]read total count not equals msg total size. totalSize=192, readTotalCount=140, bodyLen=38, topicLen=11, propertiesLength=0\r\n2018-09-11 16:44:11.134 INFO main - /home/suiyuzeng/store/consumequeue/0 mkdir OK\r\n2018-09-11 16:44:11.134 WARN main - found a illegal magic code 0x0\r\n2018-09-11 16:44:11.180 INFO main - topic:role_change, queue:4, queue offset after truncate:52549441, origin:52549441\r\nThe last line is added by me for debug.

In the log, totalSize, bodyLen, topicLen are right but propertiesLength is wrong.

So the message whit cqOffset 52549441 may was not despatch to the consume queue.\r\n\r\nIn recoverAbnormally() ,only the size is checked. Should we check isSuccess as in recoverNormally? Truncate the messages when isSuccess is false.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/422258727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/422278565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/470#issuecomment-422278565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/470","id":422278565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjI3ODU2NQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T07:02:55Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T07:02:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

I traced the call chain of getSystemToplicList and found [MQClientAPIImpl.getSystemTopicList()](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/a220364b752669c474f9795884faed9bb4e0a8c1/client/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/client/impl/MQClientAPIImpl.java#L1600) is the last method called, so RouteManagerInfo.getSystemTopicList() never be called? ? ? \r\nAt the same time, I found some systemTopic will be added in [rocketmq.broker.topic.TopicConfigManager#TopicConfigManager()](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/a220364b752669c474f9795884faed9bb4e0a8c1/broker/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/broker/topic/TopicConfigManager.java#L57) when the BrokerController is initialized, including the broker name and cluster name. So systemTopicList should include broker name and cluster name. The original code is correct.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/423159477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/423390031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/473#issuecomment-423390031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/473","id":423390031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzM5MDAzMQ==","user":{"login":"walking98","id":19318111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzE4MTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19318111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98","html_url":"https://github.com/walking98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walking98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T02:02:21Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T02:02:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So @Ah39 would you please clarify your problem or what error occur? it is a by-design behavior to use the same client instance if not setting the instance name (i.e. using 'DEFAULT' name) . thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/423390031/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/423487239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/472#issuecomment-423487239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/472","id":423487239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzQ4NzIzOQ==","user":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T10:25:36Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T10:25:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wlliqipeng some cases maybe cannot tolerate minute-level recovery time.\r\nActually, this  is a problem.
