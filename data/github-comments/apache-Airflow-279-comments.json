I would love to cherry-pick all those related changes (pylint & others) to 1.10.7 as soon as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563196282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563196334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6740#issuecomment-563196334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6740","id":563196334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzE5NjMzNA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T11:35:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T11:35:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mik-laj ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563196334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563200477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6760#issuecomment-563200477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6760","id":563200477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzIwMDQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T11:47:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T11:47:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I do not fully understand why we need this? Can you explain the difference between this protocol and the original base class?\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that in a number of places in the code (for example here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6760/commits/3784ba4ce5a4618d7e090adfd4130e1d64fc812d#diff-f95b3d6216459574a0b3954a85a98db1L251 ) other entities (for example base_job) used internal implementation of BaseExecutor (it assumed that some internal queues are there and that they are accessible as executor queued_tasks. Similar was with \"running\". This does not have to be the case. For example in case of multiple executors there might be multiple queues and it is much better to define the interface as method rather than property being queue. \r\n\r\nIt's just plain old encapsulation in the works. So we have now `executor.is_task_queued(self, task_instance_key: TaskInstanceKeyType))` instead of `task_instance_key in executor.queued`.\r\n\r\nThis is not strictly needed now, but if we define other executors in the future, we might then abstract away from implementing those internal structures differently. And I already tested and had it implemented in MultipleExecutors case so i know it's a workable change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563200477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563232022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6758#issuecomment-563232022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6758","id":563232022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzIzMjAyMg==","user":{"login":"baolsen","id":26625123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjI1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26625123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen","html_url":"https://github.com/baolsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baolsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T13:13:04Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T13:13:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready

I remember reading somewhere about using `airflow test` as the entrypoint for IDE.\r\n\r\nIn all other executors the main process is running subprocess.popen. That prevents python debuggers from debugging then new process forked as the result. So you cannot set breakpoint and hit \"Debug\" to get it working. The only way we could find so far was remote debugging, but it requires paid version of IntelliJ and it is rather complex to run. \r\n\r\nWith this setting you go back to a \"sane\" way of debugging DAGs -you just add those two lines, set the breakpoint and use \"Debug\". I am not aware of any simple way of doing with with starting subprocesses. Unless  someone knows it (but I have not heard it so far).\r\n\r\nMoreover with this we will also be able to debug the code inside Breeze using Docker integration (in the same super-intuitive and easy way). You just add two lines to your DAG, set your environment to point to your Docker image/container and you can use all the debugging features of your IDE out of the box to not only initialize but also execute your DAG. This is super-powerful. We are going to use it at our workshops we have this Friday and this is so much easier for the users to debug the DAGs this way. Even if you use other IDEs which have good debugging integration, it's going to be super easy because you debug it in exactly the same way as you debug other python programs (which means it will just work).\r\n\r\nI know @feluelle  tried it before but could not make it work with the other executors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563339004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563349360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6759#issuecomment-563349360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6759","id":563349360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzM0OTM2MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T17:39:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T17:39:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6759](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/25830a01a9e405a9ed874072a7e325125e88bf30?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.29%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master    #6759     +/-   ##\n=========================================\n- Coverage   84.31%   84.01%   -0.3%     \n=========================================\n  Files         669      669             \n  Lines       38066    38066             \n=========================================\n- Hits        32095    31983    -112     \n- Misses       5971     6083    +112\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `78.2% <0%> (-20.52%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/utils/dag\\_processing.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9kYWdfcHJvY2Vzc2luZy5weQ==) | `87.4% <0%> (-0.39%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6759?src=pr&el=footer).

With respect, adding those requirements onto this PR seems out of place.  This PR is really only about renaming the module, the additional requirements for AIP-21 seem to belong elsewhere with a larger migration of many contribution modules?  It seems out of place to do that migration just for this one module in this PR.  AFAICT, the use of this module might not be changed because the import patterns might not refer directly to the full package path for this module, but get it via higher level packaging (or wrapping) and that is not changed here in this PR.  If it is a breaking change, then it should be so because the naming pattern should be consistent across all the AWS providers (contrib modules).\r\n\r\nSince the batch operator is not already in the https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/tests/test_core_to_contrib.py, it was not found with a git-grep.  It might be an oversight that it's not there already, or an intentional omission.  Is there a clear answer as to why it is not already there?  If it's a simple omission and it's easy to add a two-line mapping, I guess it could be added here in this PR.  FYI, compare the outputs from\r\n```\r\ngit grep 'AWSBatchOperator'\r\ngit grep 'AWSAthenaOperator'\r\n```\r\nYou will see that the `AWSBatchOperator` is not already in the `airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/` package and so adding it to that test fails the test.  Based on that, my best guess is that it's an intentional omission from that test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563851879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/563889078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6765#issuecomment-563889078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6765","id":563889078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mzg4OTA3OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-10T06:40:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T03:13:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
