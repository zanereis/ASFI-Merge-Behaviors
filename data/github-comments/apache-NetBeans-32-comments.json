An Apache Licensed projects allows all kinds of usage downstream, including commercial. So, we can't have a logo that only \"NetBeans\" can use, because then we basically cannot release that.\r\n\r\nFrom reading https://www.npmjs.com/policies/trademark \r\n\r\n> The npm Logo signifies us, or a special relationship with us, and you should use it only with our permission. Since the goal is to avoid confusion about you being us, or your relationship with us, context counts. We will consider requests on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nit seems clear that we cannot include the logo in NetBeans as each NetBeans derivative will have to get specific permission for the npm logo.\r\n\r\nSince I don't believe npm inc will grant us such a generous permission given the terms in their trademark policy we can probably reject this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm also thinking if we really need the npm logo there. We could differentiate the file from a plain .js file with some hint.

This is what I wanted to change because some files, like bower.json, gruntfile.js, package.json, webpack.config.js, karma.config.js etc. should be more prominent.
