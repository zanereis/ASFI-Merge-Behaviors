that where we don't assume names at all from parquet, just element structure and types, that would ideally allow for N levels of nesting etc. and further remove us from individual engines choice of element names for parquet (or changes within the parquet spec itself). cc @SinghAsDev

So It's a good idea to put the logic of deleting data first，it will ensure deleting data successfully as far as possible.\r\n\r\nWe had this discussion in Hive before and the conclusion was that it is better to drop the metadata first. This way we might keep some unnecessary files but we always have a consistent Hive table structure. Also it is quite easy to delete the files by hand. If we go the other way around, then we might end up in a situation where we drop the files, but keep the metadata.
