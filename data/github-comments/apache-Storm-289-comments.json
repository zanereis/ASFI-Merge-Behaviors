And tuning them all perfectly to balance on that exact parallelism for the given heterogeneous hardware that we run on is going to be impossible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318472343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318480372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318480372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":318480372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQ4MDM3Mg==","user":{"login":"roshannaik","id":2366541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjY1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2366541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik","html_url":"https://github.com/roshannaik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T20:41:39Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T20:52:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the new messaging system.. the scaling rule of thumb I have found so far is relatively simple: \r\n\r\n> For fast topos (and CPU intensive topos) ... 1 executor thread per **physical core**.  It applies to ACKer executors as well. Avoid trying to max out on logical cores / hyperthreads.\r\n\r\nYou are likely to be close to getting the most out of your hardware with that rule. You can start with that and try adding/removing one or more executors to see if you can squeeze more.  \r\n\r\nI have highlighted this before, as of now ACKers are a big bottleneck (which remains not addressed) so till that gets addressed here is observation that will help:  \r\n\r\n> *1 ACKer bolt roughly handles max 3 mill/sec incoming acks\". So if you have 1worker with 1 spout and two bolts sending ack related msgs to 1 ACKer instance ... your aggregate throughput might be a somewhat less than 1/3rd of the ACKer's 3mill/sec throughput.*\r\n\r\nLike i have highlighted before, for time/scope constraints i decided not tackle any ACK issues unless related to this msging subsystem\r\n\r\nThe older system will typically need more executors per machine to get similar numbers (throughput&cpu usage).. but  throughput may not come close to the new system.\r\n\r\nThe rule for executors count v/s CPU cores for the existing msgs system seems less simple to me.\r\n\r\nTrying to run 51 executors on a 4 core machine will surely be a step towards \"de-scaling\", if there is such a word.

Latency measurements do not need it. And its a sin if you are doing that when trying to measure throughput.\r\n\r\n**TVL topology:** \r\n- Given its rate limiting nature, it definitely does not have the right name. Its employment of very high threads counts and rate limiting spouts appear to be tuned to work within the limitations of the current msging system and target the old sweetspot. Deserves a question.  Harsha's measurements (which are more sensible in terms of executor counts), shows that the current msging was brought down to its knees very quickly once the rate limiting went away.  \r\n- Also those two bolts that Harsha removed, appear to be affecting the measurements the Topo is trying to take. You need to tweak their executor counts and look into their individual throughputs as well. Its just unnecessary complexity that i dont like and distracting us from core issues IMO.\r\n- No offense, but that topo probably needs separate review and that may not be appropriate to drag into this PRs discussion.\r\n\r\n@revans2 \r\nThe drop you are seeing in your runs with the increase in splitter counts is indicative of the increased CPU contention going on even when not enough data flowing through an executor (the issue you initially brought up... of high CPU usage for idle topos).  The old system, executor seems to be spending more time sleeping when there is insufficient data flow and less CPU contention and adding redundant/idle executors is not affecting it as much.You can see its throughput plateaus which is clear indication. \r\n\r\nLowering the CPU contention for idle mode is something i plan to address... and i think have left some TODOs for myself in the code already for to keep me honest.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318494665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318496741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318496741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":318496741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODQ5Njc0MQ==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T21:51:32Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T21:51:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 I am trying to reproduce the worst-case in your last chart.

That is clearly a problem with batch not filling up and not getting flushed. The 5 sec latency corresponds to the 'topology.flush.tuple.freq.millis' setting (default 5sec). So at each step between Spout->Bolt and Bolt->Bolt if the its waiting for 5 sec then you are likely to see such ridiculous latency numbers.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I think the solution must be evident by now ...  but will state it here for the benefit of other readers to whom it may not be:\r\n\r\nTweak one or both of  these two settings:\r\n- **topology.producer.batch.size** : for low throughput topos setting this to 1 is a good idea. In the new system the throughput penalty is not that very high for a small batch compared to larger batch size.  (at current speeds)\r\n- **topology.flush.tuple.freq.millis**: You could reduce this for more frequent batch flushing. It causes the timer thread to take up some more cpu... but if throughput fluctuates between very and very low over the day, then is setting maybe better to meet latency SLA.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318520100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318520263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318520263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":318520263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODUyMDI2Mw==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T00:07:30Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T00:30:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think utilizing metrics consumer in TVL is the issue: it might matter if results are close so that contributions of other system component does matter, but it is just not acceptable latency for low rate.

TVL topo: Able to run this topo with similar or better performance compared to master. In particular concerns over CPU usage and latencies. Here I feel the default settings are not suited for the modes its being run in. But overall this is related to pt# 1 IMO\r\n \r\n3. Bug in Multi worker mode prevents inter-worker communication.\r\n \r\n4. Concern over TODOs noted in code. These seem to be giving an impression that there is lots unfinished work. Actually these are imprtant things to do but none of them are big tasks. The intention is to address them all soon in this PR. There are maybe two TODOS in code for perf bottlenecks that I dont plan to address. They were hard to find, so I felt its valuable to retain them alongside the offending line of code.

Some \"real-world topology\" runs as in addition to benchmark style topos.\r\n \r\n \r\nWe may find more issues as this progresses, but here is my assessment of the known pending work:\r\n \r\n1. Fix the high CPU usage for low throughput topos. I think this needs a sleep strategy in the bolt. The spout already has it. Right now it does busy polling.\r\n2. Look into (and fix whatever is causing) the higher latencies reported for TVL in low throughput mode\r\n3. Fix the multi-worker mode bug\r\n4. Fix all the TODOs noted\r\n5.

Better handling of low throughput Topos.\r\n\r\nYes lower CPU usage and lower latency by default.  If all this takes is changing some default configs then lets do that.  I am very concerned with having something that requires a lot of manual tuning.  Most users will not know how to do it,end up copying and pasting something off of the internet and get it wrong. That is why I was running my tests with out of the box performance.\r\n\r\nI also want to be sure that we pay attention to a mixed use case topology like with DRPC queries.  You may have one part of your topology that has high throughput, aka the data path.  And yet there is another part of the topology (DRPC control/query path) that has very low throughput.  Waiting seconds for a DRPC query to fill a batch that will never fill is painful.\r\n\r\n> 2. TVL topo: Able to run this ...\r\n\r\nOK, but to me it was just an indication that something had changed drastically and not necessarily in a good way.  My big concern is not TVL.  I don't really care much about that (and we can discuss benchmark/testing methodologies on a separate JIRA).  It is that with STORM-2306 there are some seriously counter intuitive situations (low throughput which you already called out) and some really scary pitfalls (the CPU contention which was [mentioned above](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318494665)).  But I want to be sure that it is addressed in some way.  As an end user I see that one of my bolts is backed up, so I increase the parallelism and the performance gets much worse with no indication at all in any logs or metrics why it got worse.  At a minimum we need a good way to know when this is happening, and ideally have the performance degrade gracefully instead.\r\n\r\n> 3. Bug in Multi worker mode prevents inter-worker communication.\r\n\r\nI was wrong this works.  I was just seeing messages time out because of the original problem with the host being overloaded and interpreted it wrong.\r\n\r\n> 5. Some \"real-world topology\" runs as in addition to benchmark style topos.\r\n\r\nYes and preferably ones that are running on more then one machine.  Ideally some that have multiple different topologies running at the same time on the same cluster too so we can see what happens when there is CPU contention.  Also I would like to add that it would be good to observe someone who has a currently working topology try and run it under the new system.  It might help us see where we need better documentation or to adjust default settings.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n> 6. get some more runs of TVL.  I am happy to provide some of that.  I spent some time on it the past few days trying to understand better how this patch compares to what is on master, but I'll put that in a separate post as this is getting long already, and I may have to talk about benchmark methodology some.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318748006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318759126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318759126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2241","id":318759126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODc1OTEyNg==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T20:52:27Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T20:52:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My benchmark results with Throughput Vs Latency.\r\n\r\nA side note on testing methodology.  I strongly disagree with some of the statements made about testing methodology.  I am happy to have a discussion with anyone about why Throughput Vs Latency is the way it is.  If we want to file a separate JIRA, resolve these differences of opinion and come up with a preferred methodology I am happy to.  Just so that others understand my methodology I want to summarize it here.  An end user usually knows a few things about what they want to build.\r\n\r\n1. An estimated throughput range that the topology will need to handle.\r\n2. A budget\r\n3. An target latency after which the data is not good any more (or perhaps more accurately a function that describes the drop in value for the data as it ages aka an SLA/SLO).\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to be able to measure my topology and see what it is going to cost me to achieve both 1 and 3, and if not what do I need to adjust to make this work i.e. raise the budget because the data is important or live with longer latency because the value does not drop off too fast.  The Throughput Vs Latency test is not intended to measure the maximum throughput that a topology configuration can handle.  It is intended to be a building block where you run it multiple times varying the throughput and measuring the cost (CPU/Memory) and latency at each throughput level.  I'll leave it at that for now.\r\n\r\nFor this test I ran these on the same laptop I listed [above](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2241#issuecomment-318102321).  I ran using 2 flavors of topology.  I modified Throughput Vs Latency to let me set the exact parallelism of all of the components.\r\n\r\n * Flavor A has 1 acker 1 spout 1 split bolt 1 count bolt and a max spout pending set to 1000.  This was optimized for maximum throughput under STORM-2306\r\n * Flavor B has 2 ackers 2 spouts 2 split bolts 3 counts bolts and a max spout pending set to 1500.  This was optimized for maximum throughput under master (450ed63)\r\n\r\nI ran all of these at different throughput values and against both versions of storm to give a better apples to apples comparison.  If a topology could not keep up with the desired throughput I threw out the results, as the latency and CPU used reported are invalid for that throughput.  For these tests I am only using CPU as a measure of cost, because I didn't have a simple way to compare memory.  I can if we really want to, but I didn't want to have to parse the gc log files, and under STORM-2306 the system bolt's metrics are not being reported any more which would have collected them automatically for me. For CPU I logged the output from top and pulled out the CPU usage when the topology had been running for 1 min.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\n![chart 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28734894-97e793f6-73a8-11e7-9703-39daed4208d3.png)\r\n\r\nAs was already discussed the latency at low throughput for STORM-2306 needs to be addressed and can be seen here.  But if we zoom into 1 second maximum latency.\r\n\r\n![chart 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28734943-c4c97254-73a8-11e7-8c08-0f3db98a7bb2.png)\r\n\r\nit is clearer to see what is happening at the low end.  I also graphed the throughput vs the cost (just CPU)\r\n\r\n![chart 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28735082-56aec0b6-73a9-11e7-8a97-dad37cfb3ff6.png)\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, but I think it is more informative to see it as the average cost to process 100 tuples per second.\r\n\r\n![chart 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28735110-724a53e4-73a9-11e7-886d-2f9dde991593.png)\r\n\r\nAgain because of the low throughput issues it is helpful to zoom in on the low end.\r\n\r\n![chart 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3441321/28735127-86a315e2-73a9-11e7-9213-5650d65c9b15.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the data that I used.\r\n\r\n\r\n  | Latency ms | cores CPU | cost/100 tuple/sec | Latency ms | cores CPU | cost/100 tuple/sec | Latency ms | cores CPU | cost/100 tuple/sec | Latency ms | cores CPU | cost/100 tuple/sec\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nTHROUGHPUT | master flavor A | master flavor A | master flavor A | master flavor B | master flavor B | master flavor B | STORM-2306 flavor A | STORM-2306 flavor A | STORM-2306 flavor A | STORM-2306 flavor B | STORM-2306 flavor B | STORM-2306 flavor B\r\n500 | 14.26 | 65.90 | 13.18 | 13.20 | 69.24 | 13.85 | 3,978.30 | 137.00 | 27.40 | 12,029.30 | 350.60 | 70.12\r\n1,000 | 14.38 | 60.20 | 6.02 | 12.76 | 77.69 | 7.77 | 2,206.20 | 130.20 | 13.02 | 8,975.81 | 367.50 | 36.75\r\n2,000 | 14.52 | 70.31 | 3.52 | 12.58 | 82.89 | 4.14 | 1,163.92 | 134.20 | 6.71 | 5,075.11 | 352.00 | 17.60\r\n4,000 | 14.91 | 68.09 | 1.70 | 13.39 | 71.44 | 1.79 | 598.74 | 134.80 | 3.37 | 2,969.57 | 345.30 | 8.63\r\n8,000 | 14.84 | 84.58 | 1.06 | 14.07 | 100.56 | 1.26 | 309.59 | 146.00 | 1.83 | 1,491.08 | 377.90 | 4.72\r\n16,000 | 13.56 | 78.38 | 0.49 | 14.90 | 101.59 | 0.63 | 168.43 | 146.20 | 0.91 | 753.40 | 392.40 | 2.45\r\n32,000 | 13.20 | 131.52 | 0.41 | 14.55 | 165.90 | 0.52 | 86.18 | 159.90 | 0.50 | 380.11 | 421.00 | 1.32\r\n50,000 | 12.20 | 165.29 | 0.33 | 14.25 | 200.03 | 0.40 | 69.21 | 180.00 | 0.36 | 254.41 | 397.10 | 0.79\r\n64,000 | 11.81 | 150.86 | 0.24 | 13.85 | 260.52 | 0.41 | 66.98 | 225.00 | 0.35 | 207.62 | 449.50 | 0.70\r\n75,000 | 11.50 | 200.56 | 0.27 | 13.29 | 292.54 | 0.39 | 65.80 | 280.80 | 0.37 | 212.21 | 465.00 | 0.62\r\n100,000 | 58.92 | 208.41 | 0.21 | 12.66 | 299.70 | 0.30 | 74.91 | 288.50 | 0.29 | 156.76 | 503.00 | 0.50\r\n128,000 | 97.91 | 356.76 | 0.28 | 83.36 | 384.78 | 0.30 | 100.79 | 296.70 | 0.23 | 189.01 | 521.40 | 0.41\r\n150,000 |   |   |   | 87.69 | 507.71 | 0.34 | 101.78 | 398.10 | 0.27 | 140.25 | 529.20 | 0.35\r\n200,000 |   |   |   |   |   |   | 332.92 | 336.80 | 0.17 |   |   |  \r\n\r\nI did run the tests at 256,000 sentences per second and at 300,000 but none of the topologies could keep up.

It could be argued that they could keep up with 200k so long as there never was a hickup, but I felt it better to exclude them.  STORM-2306 flavor A maxed out at about 223k.

Its really valuable to build confidence and achieve the stability we desire.\r\n\r\n-  I see one key issue with this latest test run.  Please disable max.spout.pending for 2306. It is not needed anymore and will be removed shortly in my updates to this PR. Noted in design doc.  I think your values of 1000 & 1500 are constraining  2306.  You can set the max.spout.pending to whatever suits best for the master.\r\n\r\n- Also, what values were used for **topology.producer.batch.size** &\r\n**topology.flush.tuple.freq.millis** in the 2306 runs ?  For low throughput testing, batchSize of 1 is the right setting for 2306.\r\n\r\nSuggestion...Since ACKer is a known bottleneck, I think ... 2 acker, 1 spout 1 split bolt 1 count might be a more suitable version of 'flavor A' for a 4 core machine. \r\n\r\nThe Throughput vs CPU is worth re-measuring once I provide the fix for the busy polling.\r\n\r\nI am in agreement with all that you said in that post about user's thought process and TVL's use case. For 2306, I find TVL unsuitable for gauging throughput limits due to the spout throttling. But it appears, that it is not your goal at the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318808114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/318840186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2245#issuecomment-318840186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2245","id":318840186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODg0MDE4Ng==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-29T15:59:03Z","updated_at":"2017-07-29T15:59:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @HeartSaVioR.

Worker to Worker backpressure.  The netty client and server have no backpressure in them.  If for some reason the network cannot keep up the netty client will continue to buffer messages internally in netty until you get GC/OOM issues like described in the design doc.  We ran into this when using the ZK based backpressure instead of `max.spout.pending` on a topology with a very high throughput and there was a network glitch.\r\n2. Single choke point getting messages off of a worker.  Currently there is a single disruptor queue and a single thread that is responsible for routing all of the messages from within the worker to external workers.  If any of the clients sending messages to other workers did block (backpressure) it would stop all other messages from leaving the worker.  In practice this negates the \"a choke up in a single bolt will not put the brakes on all the topology components\" from your design.  And as the number of workers in a topology grows the impact when this does happen will grow too.\r\n3. Load aware grouping needs to be back on by default and probably improved some.  Again one of the stated goals of your design for backpressure is \"a choke up in a single bolt will not put the brakes on all the topology components\".  Most of the existing groupings effectively negate this, as each upstream component will on average send a message to all down stream components relatively frequently.  Unless we can route around these backed up components one totally blocked bolt will stop all of a topology from functioning.  If you say the throughput drops by 20% when this is on, then we probably want to do some profiling and understand why this happens.  \r\n4. Timer Tick Tuples.  There are a number of things that rely on timer ticks.  Both system critical things, like ackers and spouts timing out tuples and metrics (at least for now); and code within bolts and spouts that want to do something periodically without having a separate thread.  Right now there is a single thread that does these ticks for each worker.  In the past it was a real pain to try and debug failures when it would block trying to insert a message into a queue that was full.  Metrics stopped flowing.

I know we strongly discourage users from building these types of things, and quite honestly I am happy to deprecate support for them, but we currently do support them.  So if we are going to stop supporting it lets get on with deprecating it in 1.x with clear warnings etc.  Otherwise when this goes in there will be angry customers with deadlocked topologies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/319111887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/319119078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2233#issuecomment-319119078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2233","id":319119078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTExOTA3OA==","user":{"login":"kamleshbhatt","id":4641205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDEyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4641205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/kamleshbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T16:15:49Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T16:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/319119078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/319130551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2242#issuecomment-319130551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2242","id":319130551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTEzMDU1MQ==","user":{"login":"Ethanlm","id":14900612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14900612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethanlm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T16:54:27Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T16:54:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"storm-cassandra failed.

Good to aim for fixing this in Storm 2.0 as max.spout.pending is only useful in ACK mode.\r\n2.  Not clear about this issue\r\n3. Yes the LoadAware model makes sense from a logical standpoint. Its perf bothered me enough that I felt it might be hurting as well as helping the larger cause. I anticipated some \"backpressure\" on this decision. I am ok to re-enable it and document this as something to consider for perf tuning. For some of this perf testing, IMO we need  be conscious when to enable/disable it. Would be great if someone can look into improving its perf.\r\n4. Will address the timers issue in a separate post.\r\n5.
