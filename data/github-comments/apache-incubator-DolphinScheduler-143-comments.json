As a result, an error was reported during operation, and the error content is as follows:\r\n\"Description: [Failed to obtain table field related information.].-Failed to obtain the meta information of the field of table: test_tmp_20211001. Please contact DBA to check the database and table information.-com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: \"`\" There is a grammatical error nearby.\"\r\n\r\nAfter DataX is running under DS, it can be seen in the log that it is like this when obtaining the sqlserver metadata field:\r\n\"writer\":{\r\n\"name\":\"sqlserverwriter\",\r\n\"parameter\":{\r\n\"column\":[\r\n\"`suppid`\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sqlserver table field is caused by `this number, which results in an error when querying metadata in sqlserver. The DS source code is as follows:\r\nswitch (dbType) {\r\n            case MYSQL:\r\n                return String.format(\"`%s`\", column);\r\n            case POSTGRESQL:\r\n                return String.format(\"\\\"%s\\\"\", column);\r\n            case ORACLE:\r\n                return String.format(\"\\\"%s\\\"\", column);\r\n            case SQLSERVER:\r\n                return String.format(\"`%s`\", column); --------- This is it! ! ! !\r\n            default:\r\n                return column;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe github location where the source code is located: dolphinscheduler-task-plugin/dolphinscheduler-task-datax/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/plugin/task/datax/DataxUtils.java\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nAs mentioned above, the datax plug-in is also used in DS and the \"custom template\" method is used to paste the configuration information and table fields, and the fields are without `quotation marks, the mysql data is successfully written to the sqlserver, and the writing is successful.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nUse \"custom template\" instead, but using this, the graphical interface loses its meaning, and it is very inconvenient to paste configuration information. You have to paste account passwords and links every time.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n-[X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n-[X] I agree to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/937318662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/937318758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6451#issuecomment-937318758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6451","id":937318758,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms433llm","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-06T23:20:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-06T23:20:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi:\n* Thank you for your feedback, we have received your issue, Please wait patiently for a reply.\n* In order for us to understand your request as soon as possible, please provide detailed information、version or pictures.\n* If you haven't received a reply for a long time, you can subscribe to the developer's email，Mail subscription steps reference https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/zh-cn/community/development/subscribe.html ,Then write the issue URL in the email content and send question to dev@dolphinscheduler.apache.org.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/937318758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/937336313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6451#issuecomment-937336313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6451","id":937336313,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms433p35","user":{"login":"sakinsun","id":92062925,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXzEzQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92062925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun","html_url":"https://github.com/sakinsun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sakinsun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T00:06:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T00:06:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"https://github.com/sakinsun/pic/blob/main/sqlserverwriter-column.png\r\n\r\ngithub上的 ` 间隔号无法正常显示，所以我把ds上的日志截图了","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/937336313/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
