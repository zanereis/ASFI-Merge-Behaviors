However, I am seeing this same problem in Maven with two of my JavaFX Projects, in Netbeans 14.  It seems tests and src are being treated by NetBeans as two separate packages and NetBeans is not auto-generating (test+main) folders together. My temporary maven-specific hack is 2-pronged.\r\n\r\n1.  Use `<build><testResources><testResource><directory>src/main/resources...` to add the required resources to the test\r\n2.  use `org.codehaus.mojo/build-helper-maven-plugin`  set the goal `add-test-source`, set the config>sources>source `src/main/java`.\r\n\r\nMaybe something similar can be done to gradle.  You just need to merge the test+src directories in the generated sources somehow so NetBeans can see it properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1197079102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1197079189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4439#issuecomment-1197079189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4439","id":1197079189,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5HWfqV","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-27T17:28:27Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T17:28:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks.

It was kind of easy to avoid double registration on Java classes, though there is a bug in the debugger core that prevents breakpoint registration in Groovy files. Fixing that bug, it seems both Truffle and Groovy breakpoints are created.\r\nNow Truffle and Groovy are clashing. I hope I can sort it out soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1197624861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1197720172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4402#issuecomment-1197720172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4402","id":1197720172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5HY8Js","user":{"login":"negora","id":2098654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2098654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora","html_url":"https://github.com/negora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-28T06:29:18Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T06:29:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've quickly tested this in RC2 and it works fine.

The JVM became very good at optimizing this. Most String ops are intensified. I wouldn't optimize anything by hand before knowing that this is actually a problem. But I would change it to the version i proposed at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4440#discussion_r931630020, since it creates the strings lazily/on-demand and is more compact/easier to read as bonus.\r\n\r\nIts just that the non-matching case has 4 times more checks than before this PR. Would be good to test and show that this is in fact a non-issue. e.g generate a class with a few thousand methods/fields and compare before and after this PR.\r\n\r\nEven if this turns out to be a problem there would be more paths we could take: e.g making this feature configurable/optional.

NB 13 and 14 if you hard code el link in it works fine, but will not display. Using Payara Community server, followed their Jakarta EE 9 tutorial where the same el worked perfectly on IntelliJ platform. If you just import Javax.inject.Name it displays correctly in NB.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1204486894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1204494943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4465#issuecomment-1204494943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4465","id":1204494943,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5HyyJf","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-03T21:19:09Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T21:19:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> So, am I to understand that the unit test output analysis is supported in the plug-in with NB 8.2 and it cannot be improved?\r\n\r\nthe CND plugin was written for an older version of NetBeans and hasn't changed since then.
