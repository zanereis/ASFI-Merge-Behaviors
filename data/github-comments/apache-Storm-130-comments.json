href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>Perhaps we need to define better what types of tests we want and how do we want to run them.</p>\n\n<p>I see several different levels/types of testing that should be run at different frequencies.  All of these are things that we need to do, but may not all fully be a part of the community for various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>1) True unit tests.  They run fast enough that they should not be a burden to have on by default and be a part of any build.  They should frequently mock out dependencies and try to concentrate on only executing/testing a relatively small defined piece of code.<br/>\n2) LocalCluster integration tests.  These are tests that put all of the parts of storm-core together and validate that it works as a system.  Some things that are hard to test on their own may need to be in here too.  Currently way too many of our tests are like this.  These should be able to test various configuration scenarios for correctness. I personally feel that these don't need to run as part of the build by default, but should be run as a part of CI.<br/>\n3) Cluster Integration tests.  This is where ductape comes in.  These should spin up not just storm, but the other components that storm can talk to.  H-Base, HDFS, Redis, Elastisearch, Kerberos, etc.  These don't need to be exhaustive tests trying lots of different configurations, as spinning up a cluster and running a topology can be rather slow.  These should mostly test that everything can still talk to each other and we can get the expected output.  I would love to see these as a part of CI, but I don't see travis-ci supporting it.<br/>\n4) Failure/Stress tests.  These should ideally use ductape too.  They should take a set of topologies and run through various situations, especially around trident, where we kill things, wait for recovery and verify we didn't do the wrong thing.  These can be extended in the future to include slow network, etc as we begin to support mitigations for these situations.  These too I would love to to see as a part of CI, but again I don't see travis CI supporting it.<br/>\n5) Performance tests, probably using some of ductape to set things up but maybe not.  These I would see as an extended version of ThroughputVsLatency.  Ideally we could have one that does trident and one that can work with acking disabled, and perhaps even a more real world test that interacts with other systems.  These are looking at what the maximum throughput is that we can support for a given latency.  These are things that are not simple to automatically evaluate, and really should be run on the same hardware each time so that results can be truly comparable.  Ideally the code is in open source, but actually running them may have to be done outside of the community CI.<br/>\n6) Scale tests.  How large of a cluster can we support and how large of an individual topology can we support.  This is probably similar to the performance tests, but running at a much larger scale.  We should be looking at the performance of topologies, and various operations, specifically nimbus and UI for a very large cluster.  I would love to see some/all of the code for this be in open source, but running it regularly will probably have to be done outside of the community because of a lack of hardware, and the need for manual evaluation of the results.</p>\n\n<p>I think we should concentrate on the first three, with the first two covered by this JIRA, and the third covered by a separate JIRA.  We can then branch off into automating the others once the first three are done, and we have developed experience with ductape, or whatever system we decide to use. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612627398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/154437228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/862#issuecomment-154437228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/862","id":154437228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDQzNzIyOA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T15:25:30Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T15:25:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code looks fine to me +1.
