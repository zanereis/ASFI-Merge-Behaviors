If this was pure Java, he'd have seen the exception.\n\nIn the case at hand, the behavior is in fact different. As a Java developer, I get a well-defined exception during development I can act on. As a C# developer, I have to hunt for the Java exception, which isn't my 1st hunch, delaying what would be a simple fix.\n\n>  I actually think c# layer should not add any logic/validation beyond what is odne on teh java side.\n\nThat's fair. We could raise the exception on the JVM side and send it from there to the C# side. That way, we only need the validation code once, which is a win.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/196956890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/196960266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/888#issuecomment-196960266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/888","id":196960266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Njk2MDI2Ng==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T18:23:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T18:23:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've done a pass.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/196960266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/196962103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/885#issuecomment-196962103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/885","id":196962103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Njk2MjEwMw==","user":{"login":"shulmanb","id":519484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb","html_url":"https://github.com/shulmanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T18:27:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T18:28:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer I would prefer not to delay on this, as this is not a trivial work item.

But given that we already have the schema, I thought it would be easier to use that instead?\n\n> Or even passing concatenated string?\n\nPlease don't. In the long run, we want to get rid of the current bridge and replace it with a two-process solution. The main communications channel between the two processes will be Wake, which exchanges objects serialized via Avro. Hence, even if it is just a list of strings, it would be best to have a schema for it.\n\n> The real question is how the bridge code (on the java side) can know about currently provisioned runtimes.\n\n`org.apache.reef.runtime.multi.driver.RuntimesHost` gets it as a named parameter, right? The same can be used for the Java bridge. I see two ways:\n1. All the runtimes bind this parameter. That way, we can depend on it always existing.\n2. Whichever class implements the Java endpoint to the bridge call gets two constructors. One which gets the parameter, another which doesn't. Tang will call the most specialized one.\n\nIn principle, the 1st solution seems better. The second one might be easier to build, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/197044986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/197046252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/873#issuecomment-197046252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/873","id":197046252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzA0NjI1Mg==","user":{"login":"tcNickolas","id":10113024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas","html_url":"https://github.com/tcNickolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T22:05:47Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T22:05:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll also add restriction about Maven 3.3 or newer, while we're at editing our README.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/197046252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/197053043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/888#issuecomment-197053043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/888","id":197053043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzA1MzA0Mw==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T22:29:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T22:29:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer added comment and pushed in\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/197053043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/197056018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/888#issuecomment-197056018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/888","id":197056018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzA1NjAxOA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T22:41:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T22:41:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jwang98052 Thanks!

It is caused by calling `Dispose()` on the `ContextRuntime` in the test, which causes an Exception if `CloseHandler` for Tasks is not bound. Whether or not this is expected, I am unsure, since it feels strange to dispatch a Task close event when `Dispose` is actually called on the Context. This does mirror the Java code, however. Note that if the close occurs between when the task is finished and when the `Failed` status propagates to the Task itself, an invalid transition may occur from `Done` to `Finished`. In other words, the following execution order will cause an invalid state transition:\n1. Task completes, state not yet changed.\n2. Close `ContextRuntime`, finds out task's `CloseHandler` not bound, throw an Exception, but Exception has not yet propagated upwards to change state to `Failed`.\n3. Task changes state to `Done`.\n4. Exception propagates upwards, state changed to `Failed`. Inconsistent state transition.\nI'll file a JIRA item for this tomorrow.\n\nThe second test failure has actually been lying around for a while. For more details, you can see REEF-976 and its related sub-items.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/200203370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/200203984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/896#issuecomment-200203984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/896","id":200203984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDIwMzk4NA==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-23T06:24:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T06:24:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tcNickolas Do you think it's worth it to split the two?
