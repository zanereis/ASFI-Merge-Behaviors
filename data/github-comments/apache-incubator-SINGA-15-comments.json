files](https://github.com/apache/singa/tree/dev/.github/workflows):\r\n\r\n```\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n  pull_request:\r\n```\r\n\r\nor we can keep it as a guide for the PR reviewer but not requiring all PR to pass all the tests. It will be up to the PR reviewer to decide if the failed tests should be fixed in this PR or not. I would propose to keep it because sometimes it is better to discover the failed tests in the PR before the merge. But all the team can vote on the best options for triggering the workflow. There are many [events for workflow trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) and may be some of them can be enabled on some specific workflows.\r\n\r\n> Also another problem is that if team members A and B working on the same branch, their code can pass the CI test separately, but may not be compatible to each other (e.g. due to API change)\r\n\r\nIf the `push:` trigger is enabled, this problem will be discovered when the second team member pushes the code and the workflow is triggered.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/688280432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/688418118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/792#issuecomment-688418118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/792","id":688418118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODQxODExOA==","user":{"login":"dcslin","id":13751447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzUxNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13751447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin","html_url":"https://github.com/dcslin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-07T16:15:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T16:18:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"current

Then the conda publishing workflow will run only from this forked repository because it is the only place where the secrets are defined. \r\n\r\n2. The better option is to ask the Apache INFRA to add the secrets to the project.  In this case we don't store username and password, but we store the conda upload token.

Please fix this different python versions problem.\r\n\r\nNote also that the project coverage threshold can be set in [.codecov.yml](https://github.com/apache/singa/blob/dev/.codecov.yml) like [this](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/commit-status#project-status):\r\n\r\n```\r\ncoverage:\r\n  status:\r\n    project:\r\n      default:\r\n        # basic\r\n        target: auto\r\n        threshold: 5%\r\n```\r\nThe value of threshold can be chosen by the development team based on the quality needs. In the best case, every PR should not reduce the coverage because this means it either added code without test case or it removed (or disabled) the test cases for existing code. However, if the team think this is too strict requirement, we may choose the threshold to 5% or even more. But this means that a PR can be allowed to pass even if it reduces the code coverage too much. \r\n\r\nThe PR #795 reduces the coverage by 4.97%, so setting the threshold to 5% should make it pass. But this is not recommended solution. We can use it only if the team thinks it is too strict to keep the coverage change always zero or positive. In this case, we may allow threshold of 1% or 2% to pass. But 5% seems high to me and it means there is a lot of code that was not tested and there is a problem. And thanks to the strict code coverage, we found the different python versions problem. Without the strict coverage check, may be this problem will be hidden and will cause other problems later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/692659125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/692821265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/795#issuecomment-692821265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/795","id":692821265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjgyMTI2NQ==","user":{"login":"moazreyad","id":2278792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzg3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2278792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad","html_url":"https://github.com/moazreyad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moazreyad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T16:15:27Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T16:15:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it will be better to create a new separate workflow for publishing conda packages.

After fixing the python version issue, code coverage fails again..\r\n\r\nThe coverage is now decreased by 0.01% instead of 4.97%. It still fails because we did not specify a threshold, so any decrease any in the coverage will make test fails. To solve this problem, either add a small threshold like 0.1 % to allow small drops in coverage generally in all PRs, or leave the threshold decision to each pull request reviewer to decide if the decrease in the specific PR is fine and it can be merged or it is not fine and must be fixed.\r\n\r\n> Seems it does not provide the suggestions on how to improve the code coverage.\r\n\r\nYes, it just reports the coverage results without suggestions on how to fix. This is similar to all the test cases which report the error but of course they do not usually suggest how to fix it. \r\n\r\nTo improve the coverage, the developer needs to investigate more how to create the suitable test cases to cover his new code, or how not to prevent current test cases from running (like the problem that we had in #795).

We need to extract these dependencies into something like requirements.txt so that Github (and other tools) can find them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/699624036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/700596163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/804#issuecomment-700596163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/804","id":700596163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDU5NjE2Mw==","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T09:51:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T10:01:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/singa/pull/804?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#804](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/singa/pull/804?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/singa/commit/5c462d0de24d5cd6171dc71d303f3ad15747a72a?el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `5.17%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/singa/pull/804/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=raMbqTl5Tl)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/singa/pull/804?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master     #804      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   65.09%   70.26%   +5.17%     \n==========================================\n  Files          86      100      +14     \n  Lines        4804    11659    +6855     \n==========================================\n+ Hits         3127     8192    +5065     \n- Misses       1677     3467    +1790     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| #singa-cpp | `65.09% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| #singa-python | `73.88% <ø> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
