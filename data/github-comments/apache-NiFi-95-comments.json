First, the `nifi-web-utils` tests were not running, because they are Groovy tests and there is nothing in `src/test/java`. Without a file (even empty) in that directory, the Groovy tests do not get picked up (neither compiled nor run). I added the `groovy-eclipse-compiler` plugin to `nifi-web-utils/pom.xml` to ensure this is run. That commit is [5c0232c](https://github.com/alopresto/nifi/commit/5c0232c9dd8009dc69bc5adb1fb1ef7942832911). \r\n\r\nSecond, there was a warning about a duplicate definition of `httpclient` dependency in `nifi-web-utils/pom.xml`. I removed it, and that commit is [5f538c6](https://github.com/alopresto/nifi/commit/5f538c69f1aebc0b6b0d6dbabf0f09c8e9854a57). (Actually looks like this may have been an errant copy/paste from git diff; either way it's fine in the merged version). \r\n\r\nBoth of those commits were rebased onto Nathan's rebased commits as well. \r\n\r\nA gist demonstrating the issue is [here](https://gist.github.com/alopresto/184f3631ec44a4c036d323d622ea97aa). \r\n\r\nRan `contrib-check` and all tests pass. +1, merging.

After some testing, with tags working \"properly\", I think we blew through our custom metric limits with Datadog. I saw someone on the previous PR that implemented this reporting task had mentioned it would be a good idea to allow users to select which metrics they would want reported. That may be a very good idea. In the meantime, I may suggest that we just remove all of the tags _except_ the environment tag that is configured with the controller service. Datadog counts each metric name + tag combo as a unique custom metric. Eliminating all of the non-environment tags, which I don't think are terribly useful, may alleviate this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/415899267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/416078745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2956#issuecomment-416078745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2956","id":416078745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjA3ODc0NQ==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-26T22:51:24Z","updated_at":"2018-08-26T22:51:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ottobackwards @joewitt \r\n\r\nI've renamed the bundle based on your feedback.
