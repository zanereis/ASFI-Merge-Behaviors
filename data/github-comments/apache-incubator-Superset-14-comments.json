I have a similar problem, not sure, but I guess it's the same problem.\n\nInstead of TableView, my problem is on DruidDatasourceModelView: when I access /druiddatasourcemodelview/edit/5, it's always 404, when datasource with id 5 actually really exists.\nAfter I traced the code, I figured out the cause: DruidMetricInlineView is one of the related views of  DruidDatasourceModelView, when DruidMetricInlineView is rendered, its related views must be rendered as well. So the 404 error is not thrown when searching for the datasource, it's thrown when finding the DruidMetricInlineView. Flask AppBuilder wants to find a DruidMetricInlineView with id=93 according to one of the variable in the (probably cookie-based) session, but that record is actually deleted. So there is no chance to clean that variable in the session. I think it is a bad design of Flask AppBuilder to let the page to be dependent on the session, I would expect those information to be passed by the query string.\nYou can check whether your problem is the same as mine by checking whether there has been any deleted record in TableColumnInlineView or SqlMetricInlineView (both are related views of TableModelView). Or you can simply try cleaning the cookie in the browser.\n\nBut in the long term, there should be some way to fix this problem either by improving the design of caravel or Flask AppBuilder. It really harms the user experience for it's so confusing when the page is dependent on the session rather than the url.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/218841331/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/218905909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/456#issuecomment-218905909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/456","id":218905909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODkwNTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"COLABORATI","id":6514273,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTQyNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6514273?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI","html_url":"https://github.com/COLABORATI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/COLABORATI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T22:38:35Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T22:38:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Right, I now understand that there is already gunicorn that comes with caravel out of the box.
