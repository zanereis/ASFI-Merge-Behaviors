thought this day would never come.\r\n\r\n@nishantmonu51 you didn't mention motivation in the description, but I guess it's so Druid's runtime would be able to treat nulls in a more SQL standard way. Some initial thoughts:\r\n\r\n> To match the new semantics we need to make aggregators nullable, where if an aggregator encounters a null value the result will be null value.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is more SQL-like behavior, you don't want this, since it's not how SQL works. SQL aggregators like `SUM(expr)` skip NULLs but still aggregate all non-NULLs. It's still different from what Druid does though (especially for MIN/MAX where Druid would treat missing as 0 and standard SQL behavior would skip it).\r\n\r\n> Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nYou're missing a big one, which is backwards compatibility in the runtime: preserving current behavior where `null` and `\"\"` the treated the same. There's a lot of code out there that expects Druid's null handling to work the way it currently does, and we don't want to break it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/305862319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/305863713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4359#issuecomment-305863713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4359","id":305863713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTg2MzcxMw==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-02T17:48:12Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T21:14:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ITKafkaTest - infinite repetition of messages like\r\n```\r\n2017-06-02T17:44:17,098 INFO [MonitorScheduler-0] com.metamx.emitter.core.LoggingEmitter - Event [{\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"timestamp\":\"2017-06-02T17:44:17.098Z\",\"service\":\"\",\"host\":\"\",\"metric\":\"jetty/numOpenConnections\",\"value\":0}]\r\n2017-06-02T17:44:18,668 INFO [main] com.metamx.http.client.pool.ChannelResourceFactory - Generating: http://172.17.0.1:8090\r\n2017-06-02T17:44:18,673 INFO [main] io.druid.testing.clients.OverlordResourceTestClient - Index status response{\"task\":\"index_realtime_kafka_test_0_2017-06-02T17:38:58.540Z_laaaokep\",\"status\":{\"id\":\"index_realtime_kafka_test_0_2017-06-02T17:38:58.540Z_laaaokep\",\"status\":\"RUNNING\",\"duration\":-1}}\r\n2017-06-02T17:44:18,674 INFO [main] io.druid.testing.utils.RetryUtil - Attempt[16]: Task index_realtime_kafka_test_0_2017-06-02T17:38:58.540Z_laaaokep still not complete.

with the above proposal, the user has the ability to replace null with any default value at the ingestion time and achieve the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nI don't think the replacement at ingestion time is enough to preserve the current behavior. There's a lot of places in the query runtime where nulls and empty strings are treated the same, like comparisons in filters (consider `\"filter\":{\"type\":\"selector\",\"dimension\":\"foo\", \"value\":null}` and `\"filter\":{\"type\":\"selector\",\"dimension\":\"foo\", \"value\":\"\"}`which currently have identical behavior). Other examples are args to extractionFns, return values from extractionFns, and behavior of keys into lookups.

@drcrallen, I see, yeah, to be fully backwards compatible the places at query time which treats empty string and nulls as same will need to have two separate code paths based on a druid runtime property e.g druid.null.behavior by default it will treat null and empty strings as same and preserve the current behavior and users can set it to 'sql' to get the new sql behavior. \r\n\r\nI also feel that having two separate code paths and behavior at lots of places may not be a good and will lead to confusion for users in long run and I would propose to move to sql behavior in future major releases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/306548019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/306550341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4349#issuecomment-306550341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4349","id":306550341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjU1MDM0MQ==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T16:58:06Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T16:58:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also
