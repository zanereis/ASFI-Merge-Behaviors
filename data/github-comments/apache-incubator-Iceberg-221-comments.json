I also think that using this as a way to make table properties transactional is probably a bad idea, but it's been requested in the past so we should probably have an approved way to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nTable properties purposely don't have transactional guarantees, to avoid using them to coordinate state. Table properties are supposed to be used to configure the table, not to hold important state. What I recommend to accomplish the use case you're talking about is putting the watermark in snapshot properties instead of table properties. That's what we do for Flink commits and we get exactly-once behavior, although the check for the watermark is done outside of the commit path. Concurrent Flink writes would use different watermark properties because they use watermarks that are job-specific.\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to provide a custom validation that can do any check you want. For example, your Kafka example could create watermarks based on some chunk of time that is being processed and the custom validation could check the last few snapshots to see whether another process has already committed. That's a good use case.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I'd probably take a slightly different approach than the one you've implemented. I'd add a `validate(Predicate<TableMetadata> current)` to either `SnapshotUpdate`, or the more general `PendingUpdate`. That way each table operation can have its own custom validation against the current table state. Using a transaction would automatically check all of the custom validations for each operation, so there would be no need to alter `Transaction`. And there's no need for a custom class. We typically use Java function interfaces where possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1369254153/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1369280546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6420#issuecomment-1369280546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6420","id":1369280546,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85RnZAi","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-03T00:05:15Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T00:05:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for writing this up, @JanKaul! It's a good idea to specify how to maintain metadata for materialized views.\r\n\r\nI think that the approach, to associate a view with some table that stores the materialized version, is a good design choice. And the metadata you have is a great start as well, although I think we can simplify or improve a couple of things.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think we want to avoid keeping much state information in complex table properties. Those aren't designed for the purpose and make the table a bit difficult to use. What I recommend instead reusing the existing snapshot metadata structure to store what you need as snapshot properties. This approach has some really nice features in addition to being a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nEach materialized view version is going to be stored in a snapshot, so I think it makes sense to take your idea of a \"refresh\" and simply store that metadata in snapshot properties. Then we don't need a \"current\" refresh ID, we can just reuse the current snapshot. Similarly, we wouldn't need a new ID, we could just use the snapshot ID, and the sequence number is automatically associated.\r\n\r\nThe metadata in snapshot properties would be very similar, but much smaller:\r\n| v1 | Snapshot property | Description\r\n--|--|--\r\n_required_ | `view_version_id` | version ID of the view that was materialized\r\n_required_ | `table.<identifier>` | table UUID and snapshot ID for the table identified by <identifier> that was read\r\n\r\nIn the table, I've also cut out a few of the base table properties...\r\n* Rather than `type`, just rely on everything being an Iceberg table upstream. _We may not want to do this, but it makes everything simple_\r\n* Rather than having a type for Hadoop vs Metastore tables, this makes no distinction. We should not design much for Hadoop tables because they are not recommended.\r\n* Removed properties. We can include a catalog name in the table identifier, and adding the table UUID ensures that we always use the same upstream table (or have to recompute a `full` refresh).\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about keeping upstream table UUIDs and snapshot IDs in the snapshot metadata is that it allows us to roll back the state of the view along with the upstream tables. For example, if we have an hourly job that produces bad data and an agg MV based on it, it is possible to roll back both the table and the MV to the matching state. We can also do incremental refresh based on the closest materialized snapshot, not just the latest.\r\n\r\nI think we would still want some MV metadata in table properties:\r\n\r\n| v1 | Table property | Description\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n_required_ | `materialized_view_format_version` | The MV spec version used\r\n_required_ | `view_identifier` | Identifier for the view that is materialized\r\n_optional_ | `refresh_strategy` | `full` or `incremental`, default: `full`\r\n\r\nWe may want additional metadata as well, like a UUID to ensure we have the right view. I don't think we have a UUID in the view spec yet, but we could add one.\r\n\r\nI also moved the refresh strategy from the view to the MV table. I think we want to keep as much config on the table as possible, if it may differ between views. I could imagine a case where you might keep both incremental and full materialized versions or might want to have different partitioning specs for materialization, in which case you'd want that set on the table. I think the only thing I'd add to the view itself is the identifier for a materialized table.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I think we may want to change is to add a section of the proposal for view invalidation. Your property to allow stale data is on the right track, but we can actually detect when a table has not been updated in a way that affects the view query in a lot of cases. For example, if you plan the final query and get input splits for the tables in the view, you can check whether the input is based on a snapshot newer than the MV's base snapshot. If it isn't, then it is safe to use the materialized version. This is a little tricky since you have to account for whether files matching the final filter were deleted, but it should be entirely a metadata operation. I think it would be great to document this as part of a spec.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1369280546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1369283460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4971#issuecomment-1369283460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4971","id":1369283460,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85RnZuE","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-03T00:11:04Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T00:11:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

If I understand correctly,   statistics become unreliable when NaN values are present, so parquet will just discard the statistics generated by the added non-nulls and set hasNonNullValue to false.\r\n\r\nSo I think the root cause of this is that ParquetMetricRowGroupFilter mistakenly used `hasNonNullValue()` to determine whether there is a non-null value in the column chunk. As above, this method cannot be used for such purpose. I think we can only conclude that there is no non-null value in the column chunk when \r\n`Statistics#getNumNulls() = ColumnChunkMetadata#getValueCount()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1370862183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1370889302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6410#issuecomment-1370889302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6410","id":1370889302,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85RthxW","user":{"login":"gaborkaszab","id":29145491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborkaszab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T12:47:00Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T12:47:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> @gaborkaszab Can you please get this merged?\r\n\r\nThe patch LGTM, however, I won't be able to merge as I'm not a committer. cc @rdblue ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1370889302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1371076213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6074#issuecomment-1371076213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6074","id":1371076213,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85RuPZ1","user":{"login":"gaborkaszab","id":29145491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborkaszab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-04T15:30:39Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T15:30:39Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> This looks good to me other than a couple of small things to fix:\r\n> \r\n> * revapi suppressions are reordered, which is going to introduce churn\r\n> * It isn't clear why this wouldn't work with a create transaction\r\n\r\nThanks for the reviews so far, @rdblue!\r\n- revapi part should be ok now\r\n- I removed that Precondition that didn't allow to use SnapshotManager with a createTransaction.

I think one way we can go with this PR is that, because we are using Delta standalone, instead of following the same pattern for having a base class action and then a Spark extension, we can directly make Delta to Iceberg conversion work just within the `iceberg-delta-lake` module.

I think one way we can go with this PR is that, because we are using Delta standalone, instead of following the same pattern for having a base class action and then a Spark extension, we can directly make Delta to Iceberg conversion work just within the `iceberg-delta-lake` module. Unit test can be done end to end to test the conversion capability.\r\n> \r\n> The code in Spark module can be completely removed, as user can simply get Hadoop configuration from Spark session and invoke the method in the `iceberg-delta-lake` module.\r\n> \r\n> By doing this, it also completely removes the concern of adding Delta dependency to Iceberg Spark distribution.\r\n> \r\n> Trino can be intergrated in the same way to offer the conversion logic. @findepi\r\n> \r\n> There could be improvements made in the future to parallelize the retrieval of delta log in different engines like Spark and Trino, but those could be added later as extension points in the `iceberg-delta-lake` module.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think? @JonasJ-ap\r\n\r\n\r\n> I was thinking about this last night, feels like the current blocker is unit testing with Spark, but actually if we just use `iceberg-spark` as a test dependency, I think we can move all the tests currently in the Spark module to `iceberg-delta-lake` and satisfy the goal of unit-testing the implementation without the need to find another way to write Delta lake tables outside Spark.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your suggestions. I agree that it is unnecessary to create a spark action to just provide hadoop configuration. We may have some trouble if we include `iceberg-spark` for the unit test as the Java CI does not include iceberg-spark in the build.
