to supplement, `Apache ShardingSphere` uses SpringBoot `1.x` to build unit tests, this problem for a specific version of `SpringBoot` may not be solved, especially SpringBoot `2.3.x` has stopped community maintenance. Notice that you use `com.baomidou:dynamic-datasource-spring-boot-starter`, so I have reason to think you have seen my message, for SpringBoot `2.5.1` to `3.0.0-M1`, `ShardingSphere` and `dynamic-datasource-spring-boot-starter` integration works fine. Refer to [整合sharding的时候，停止程序报错，和#395差不多 baomidou/dynamic-datasource-spring-boot-starter#415

Startup class\r\n   Reference to: `org.apache.shardingsphere.example.sharding.raw.jdbc.ShardingRawJavaConfigurationExample`\r\n2. DataSourceFactory\r\n   Reference to: `org.apache.shardingsphere.example.sharding.raw.jdbc.factory.DataSourceFactory`\r\n3. DataSourceConfiguration\r\n   Reference to: `org.apache.shardingsphere.example.sharding.raw.jdbc.config.ShardingDatabasesConfigurationPrecise`\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n- In ShardingDatabasesConfigurationPrecise:\r\n```java\r\nprivate ShardingRuleConfiguration createShardingRuleConfiguration() {\r\n        ShardingRuleConfiguration result = new ShardingRuleConfiguration();\r\n        ...\r\n        result.setDefaultDatabaseShardingStrategy(new StandardShardingStrategyConfiguration(\"user_id\", \"inline\"));\r\n        Properties props = new Properties();\r\n        props.setProperty(\"algorithm-expression\", \"demo_ds_${user_id % 2}\");\r\n        result.getShardingAlgorithms().put(\"inline\", new ShardingSphereAlgorithmConfiguration(\"INLINE\", props));\r\n        ...\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe `new ShardingSphereAlgorithmConfiguration` specifies the use of the `INLINE` algorithm, and passes in a property containing \"algorithm-expression\" as a parameter. In the algorithm map, the key is also `inline`.\r\nAt the same time, a `StandardShardingStrategyConfiguration` is created in `defaultDatabaseShardingStrategy`, and `inline` (here is the key of map) is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Custom Algorithm:\r\n\r\nTake `org.apache.shardingsphere.example.extension.classbased.sharding.raw.jdbc.fixture.ClassBasedStandardShardingAlgorithmFixture` as an example, it accepts a parameter \"sharding-count\" to calculate sharding count:\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n    public String doSharding(final Collection<String> availableTargetNames, final PreciseShardingValue<Integer> shardingValue) {\r\n        for (String each : availableTargetNames) {\r\n            if (each.endsWith(String.valueOf(shardingValue.getValue() % shardingCount))) {\r\n                return each;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the new `ShardingDatabasesConfigurationPrecise`, we can define:\r\n````java\r\nprivate ShardingRuleConfiguration createShardingRuleConfiguration() {\r\n        ShardingRuleConfiguration result = new ShardingRuleConfiguration();\r\n        ...\r\n        result.setDefaultDatabaseShardingStrategy(new StandardShardingStrategyConfiguration(\"user_id\", \"custom\"));\r\n        Properties props = new Properties();\r\n        props.setProperty(\"strategy\", \"standard\");\r\n        props.setProperty(\"algorithmClassName\", \"org.apache.shardingsphere.example.extension.classbased.sharding.raw.jdbc.fixture.ClassBasedStandardShardingAlgorithmFixture\");\r\n        props.setProperty(\"sharding-count\", \"4\");\r\n        result.getShardingAlgorithms().put(\"custom\", new ShardingSphereAlgorithmConfiguration(\"CLASS_BASED\", props));\r\n        ...\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nillustrate:\r\n- Because `ClassBasedStandardShardingAlgorithmFixture` implements `StandardShardingAlgorithm`, the strategy in props is `standard`;\r\n- `algorithmClassName` is used to specify the custom algorithm to use;\r\n- `sharding-count` is a parameter required by the algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe other parts are basically the same as the `sharding-raw-jdbc-example`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1073984494/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1074001876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16102#issuecomment-1074001876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/16102","id":1074001876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M5AA_fU","user":{"login":"pparthenhs","id":9752042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NTIwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9752042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs","html_url":"https://github.com/pparthenhs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pparthenhs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-21T14:56:25Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T14:57:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @terrymanu, \r\n\r\nI have added some tests in order to fulfill the un-coved code lines.

demo\r\n```\r\nimport lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;\r\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;\r\nimport org.hibernate.EmptyInterceptor;\r\nimport java.util.HashMap;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\n@Slf4j\r\npublic class AutoAddDidInterceptor extends EmptyInterceptor {\r\n\r\n    public static ThreadLocal<Map<String, String>> myTable = new ThreadLocal<>();\r\n\r\n    public static void setInterceptorDid(String did){\r\n        Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();\r\n        map.put(\"did_update\", did);\r\n        myTable.set(map);\r\n    }\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String onPrepareStatement(String sql) {\r\n        log.debug(\"sql interceptor worked\" );\r\n        Map<String, String> map = myTable.get();\r\n        if (map == null) {\r\n

if(sql.startsWith(\"update\")){\r\n            String[] wheres = sql.split(\"where\");\r\n            StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();\r\n            stringBuffer.append(wheres[0]).append(\" where did = '\"+did+\"' and \").append(wheres[1]);\r\n            log.warn(\"sql has been modify and now is {}\",stringBuffer.toString());\r\n            //clean threadLocal\r\n            myTable.remove();\r\n            return stringBuffer.toString();\r\n        }else{\r\n            return sql;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand config the interceptor in config file I'm use properties\r\n\r\n```\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.session_factory.session_scoped_interceptor=com.AutoAddDidInterceptor\r\n```\r\nthen use in business code like this\r\n```\r\n            AutoAddDidInterceptor.setInterceptorDid(post.getDid());\r\n            postRepository.save(post);\r\n```\r\nand in my test its already work to update data.\r\n\r\nbut I have some Security question that if it might seen SQL injection problem.\r\nWelcome to point out the problem and give me some suggestion.\r\nhope to help the other programmers and save time.(～￣▽￣)～
