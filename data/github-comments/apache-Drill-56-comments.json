Would it be helpful for other reviewers if we included a bit of explanation?\r\n\r\nIn particular, what is the structure of the new vector? The true map vector seems to have a user-defined key and value type. Does this mean keys can be integers or maps? Do the proposed map functions handle non-Varchar keys? Do they handle repeated or map keys? If not, should the implementation restrict key types?\r\n\r\nHow do we handle varying value types? (I have a map with, say, {name: \"Fred\", balance: 123}. Would the user specify a Union? Have we fixed the many existing problems with the Union type? Or, is the true map meant to be like a Java map: Map<K,V>, and not a Python or JSON map with string keys and values of any type?\r\n\r\nGiven the title of this PR, \"Develop vector for canonical Map<K,V>\", the intent seems to be to create a Java-like map. In this case, the name \"true\" map, means \"true Java map\", not \"true JSON map.\" This may seem like an unimportant distinction, but I do point you to [Drill's JSON data model](https://drill.apache.org/docs/json-data-model/).\r\n\r\nI suppose the the \"V\" type could be Union to implement a JSON map. Would the various functions that work with this map handle union?\r\n\r\nGiven that this whole exercise simply creates two correlated lists, \"key\" and \"value\", I do wonder at the need for all the new complexity. Can't we simply add functions that work with an existing repeated map where the user tells us which column is the key and which is the value? Or, infer the key and value if the user uses the names \"key\" and \"value\"?\r\n\r\nA bit of documentation (a README file, a package-info file or just a Javadoc explanation in the vector class) would help answer these questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/515716535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/515716607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1827#issuecomment-515716607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1827","id":515716607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTcxNjYwNw==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-27T22:02:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-27T22:02:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cgivre, fixed the incorrect import.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/515716607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/515719706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1829#issuecomment-515719706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1829","id":515719706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTcxOTcwNg==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-27T23:10:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-28T05:27:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR has no unit tests.

We could also allow DICTIONARY (similar to how we allow both VARCHAR and CHARACTER VARYING). The DICT name might be better since a MAP<K,V> is not like a generalized Python or JSON map (as we discussed.) We are actually defining a dictionary of keys and values in which the values must all be of the same type. I don't feel strongly about the name, but I did think it was a good idea when Ted suggested it.\r\n\r\nAs we can see, a huge amount of work went into this feature. (@KazydubB clearly did a fantastic job understanding all the bits and pieces.) I was kind of hoping we could handle the DICT type as just a bit of metadata sugar on top of the existing REPEATED MAP vector. This PR does do that, of course. Can we make the change with less impact?\r\n\r\nThe rough idea might be to create a new base class for both `RepeatedMap` and DICT. (Maybe we call it `AbstractRepeatedMap`). The structure would be identical for both, only the metadata bits would vary. A repeated map would allow adding any number of vectors, the DICT would take a `MaterializedField` that has the required key and value children in place, then create those two child vectors.\r\n\r\nWith this, any code that currently references `RepeatedMapVector` could change to reference `AbstractRepeatedMap` instead. Immediately, all existing code that works with repeated maps (including EVF) would work with `DICT`, especially when reading the vector. That is, if code does not really care about the meaning of the children, then it should not care if the vector is a `RepeatedMap`, or the more restricted form, a `DICT`. Flatten, for example, should work just as well for either case.\r\n\r\n The one part we'd want to add is the step to create the `DICT` vector and its `MaterializedField`. Presumably that code is in this PR for some cases.  For the RowSet and EVF stuff, we'd want to specify the `DICT<K,V>` info in metadata. We'd prohibit adding new children to a `DICT`. `RepeatedMap` would continue to allow adding new children. It may be that this is really the only difference.\r\n\r\nSuppose we used the old-style complex writer or the newer column writer. The client should not care if it is writing a MAP or DICT: it will just work with fields. Here's the RowSet version treating a `DICT` as a repeated `MAP`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTupleMetadata schema = ...\r\n   // Convenience short-hand to assume the key is a VARCHAR, we specify the value type.\r\n   .addDict(\"contacts\", MinorType.VARCHAR) ...\r\n// Create row set and writer here...\r\nArrayWriter dictWriter = rowSetWriter.array(\"contacts\");\r\nTupleWriter kvWriter = dictWriter.tuple();\r\nkvWriter.scalar(\"key\").setString(\"fred\");\r\nkvWriter.scalar(\"value\").setString(\"555-1212\");\r\ndictWriter.save()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for read:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRowSetReader reader = rowSetWithDict.reader();\r\nArrayReader dictReader = reader.array(\"contacts\");\r\nTupleReader kvReader = dictReader.tuple();\r\n...\r\n// On each row\r\nwhile (dictReader.next()) {\r\n  System.println(dictReader.scalar(\"key\").getString() + \", \" +\r\n   dictReader.scalar(\"value\").getString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above cleanly handles the case where the key and value types can be anything. The above works for values that are unions, maps, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `RowSetBuilder` should just work to build a dictionary, and the verifier should also work to compare two row sets.\r\n\r\nLet's compare the above idea with the current PR. In this PR, we do create a new vector, but we add a bit too much specialized semantics. Doing so then forces us to create new complex readers and writers. For the RowSet framework, we'd have to add new column readers and writers. And, since we are creating all this new code, we need unit tests for it.\r\n\r\nThat is, we are not exploiting the fact that a DICT really is a repeated MAP, just one with some restrictions. If, instead, we could add DICT as just a new way to create a kind of repeated MAP, and treat it as a repeated map for reads and writes, then we can leverage all the existing repeated map tests; we'd just add tests to ensure that the DICT creation code works.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, can we implement a DICT as mostly new metadata, and new mechanisms for vector creation, but leave vector writing and reading pretty much the same as a generic repeated map?\r\n\r\nThese are all just suggestions and brainstorming; perhaps @KazydubB already looked into this approach and found issues. Would be helpful to know what issue came up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/515828830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/515863945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1830#issuecomment-515863945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1830","id":515863945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTg2Mzk0NQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T06:35:07Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T06:41:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers

@paul-rogers, thank you for your elaborate comment.\r\nThis map is intended to be a map in Java's sense, with strict key and map types. The key type was indeed planned to be primitive only while the value could have been of any type either primitive or complex, but I accidentally removed the check when finalizing the changes :(. Just to be clear, key type is not limited to `VARCHAR`, but can be of any other, like `INT`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT4` etc.\r\n\r\nThis new type is intended to be used for sources which support this type of maps, i.e. Parquet files, Hive tables etc.\r\nSupport for EVF was not considered because I thought it was not supporting readers which support such map type, but thank you for guidance, I'll look into it. Of course, it should be added.\r\n\r\nThe vector `extends` `RepeatedMapVector` and is essentially a repeated map vector (as you've noted) with constraints regarding its children and type of one of the child, 'key' (it `@Override`s `RepeatedMapVector.Accessor#getObject(int)` as well). This constraint is implemented in `TrueMapVector#putChild(String, ValueVector)` which dissalows the vector to have other children fields. Additionally, new reader and writer was introduced which also `extend` (inherit from) repeated map's reader and writer respectively. The new writer differs from its parent by how it handles children's offsets and introduces two essential methods, `startKeyValuePair()` and `endKeyValuePair()`, to separate entries. And new type's reader adds methods to find index for a given key and read a value for a given key into passed `ValueHolder`.\r\nWith this approach for writer, writing data into new map vector is not any different than writing data into repeated map (of course, if user (developer) is not trying to access \"unknown\" field, other than defined `\"key\"` and `\"value\"` on the writer for the new type). Flatten, for example, does behave the same for the two vectors. In places these two vectors (`TrueMapVector` and `RepeatedMapVector`) have different behavior, this is done in code; in other case the common behavior (logic) is used.\r\nThat being said, I do not see a reason to create another `AbstractRepeatedMap` as I think extending `RepeatedMapVector` suffices (unless we really need to separate these two vectors).\r\n\r\nI am going to add documentation to code to avoid reverse engineering for developers (sorry for making you go through this!) and add unit tests for the new `ValueVector` and its writer and slightly refactor the code to implement aforementioned constraints. Also, I'll rename the type to `DICT`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/516003913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/516246460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1829#issuecomment-516246460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1829","id":516246460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjI0NjQ2MA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T03:33:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T03:33:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KazydubB, thanks for the explanations. Probably not productive for us to continue to debate the design now that the code is done. Probably best to get this in so folks can use it; leaving refinements for later.\r\n\r\nYou correctly point out that EVF is used by only two readers, neither of which support a TRUEMAP. The remaining EVF reader, JSON, uses true maps (not a TRUEMAP) that can map string keys to any kind of value, so it will continue to need to use the (non-true) MAP type. So, we won't need EVF TRUEMAP support for that reader either. Instead, we can let a volunteer can add EVF support later when it might be needed.\r\n\r\nThe thought about a new base class simply recognized that a TRUEMAP does not have the same creation semantics as a Repeated MAP, so having TRUEMAP inherit from the leaf Repeated MAP type introduces very odd code hacks. (Like saying a Dog is a subclass of Cat, but without the purr and much more social.) But, again, I suppose we can fix that later if we have the need.\r\n\r\nStill, I would suggest that, if you can spare a bit of time, that we add tests so we're not using the Parquet reader as our primary testing mechanism. The Parquet reader is quite complex and debugging this code in the context of the Parquet reader will be difficult.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/516246460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/516247510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1830#issuecomment-516247510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1830","id":516247510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjI0NzUxMA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T03:38:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T03:38:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, thanks much for the reviews and the suggestions.

It will allow certain other tasks to be much easier.\r\n\r\nThe first observation is that it would be best not to put the RowSet and ResultSetLoader stuff in the same package: they represent two independent systems and our package naming should make that clear.\r\n\r\nPerhaps\r\n\r\n1) Rename the existing physical.rowSet to physical.resultSet.\r\n2) Move the RowSet classes to a new physical.rowSet.\r\n\r\nThe difference, so we're clear, is that RowSet works on a single batch, while the ResultSet works across a stream of batches. If operators, say, want to use the row set stuff to read batches, then we need a ResultSetReader that automagically handles things like schema changes across batches, etc.\r\n\r\nTo be very clear:\r\n\r\n\"row set\" -- A collection of rows. Typically called a \"batch\" in Drill.\r\n\"result set\" -- A collection of rows for an entire query. Typically consists of multiple (related) batches.\r\n\r\nI used the term \"row set\" only because the classes would otherwise get lost with all the existing \"Batch\" classes.

Perhaps you can offer there the format rules you've found to work, such as `int[] foo;` instead of `int foo[];`, classes-at-bottom, no single-line method declarations, preferred import sort order and so on. Might also include preferences for Java over Guava methods for common operations. That way, we can all follow the best practices you've discovered.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/522085882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/522131852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1843#issuecomment-522131852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1843","id":522131852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjEzMTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T19:54:14Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T19:54:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The latest change caused tests failures.
