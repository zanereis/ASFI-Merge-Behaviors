Then use Java to pass features/data.\n\n``` scala\nclass MXNetPredictor (prefix: String, epoch: Int, batchSize: Int) {\n\n  private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(classOf[MXNetPredictor])\n\n  val model = FeedForward.load(prefix, epoch)\n\n  /**\n    * predict\n    *\n    * @param flat A flat feature input vector.\n    * @param shape Shape of input data.\n    * @return\n    */\n  def predict(flat: Array[Float], shape: Array[Int]): Array[NDArray] = {\n    val ndArray = NDArray.array(flat, Shape(shape))\n\n    val data: IndexedSeq[NDArray] = IndexedSeq(ndArray)\n    val label: IndexedSeq[NDArray] = IndexedSeq()\n\n    val inputBatchSize = shape(0)\n    if (inputBatchSize != batchSize) {\n      logger.error(\"Input data shape should be consistent with your batchSize.\")\n      logger.error(\"batchSize: \" + batchSize)\n      logger.error(\"Input data shape: \" + inputBatchSize)\n    } else {\n      val valData: NDArrayIter = new NDArrayIter(data, label, batchSize)\n      val prediction = model.predict(valData)\n      return prediction\n    }\n    null\n  }\n```\n\nAt Java side, I also provide a prediction API.\n\n``` java\npublic String predict(String utterance) {\n        float[] features = generateFeature(utterance);\n        int[] shape = {batchSize, 1, sentenceSize, embeddingSize};\n        NDArray prediction = predictor.predict(features, shape);  // predictor is MXNetPredictor.scala\n\n        int index = (int) prediction.toArray()[0];\n        return xxx;\n    }\n```\n\n### Issues.\n\nI use scala-pkg by simply add a maven dependency in IntelliJ, I was success in running a CNN for text classification with pretrain-embedding with the same code above, in which its input is (batch_size, 1, sentence_size, embedding_size); but when I change to this(without embedding) setting, input shape is (batch_size, sentence_size), it's wrong.\n\nThe only difference is their network definition and their input shape.\n\n> [20:49:45] /Users/lewis/Workspace/source-codes/release/mxnet/dmlc-core/include/dmlc/logging.h:245: [20:49:45] src/operator/./reshape-inl.h:122: Check failed: oshape.Size() == dshape.Size() Target shape size is different to source.

We can easily reduce 90% GPU memory just by setting iter_size to 10. We don't need to think about which layers could possibly be the places that need to bookkeep computations.
