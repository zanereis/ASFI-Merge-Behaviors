A few thoughts:\r\n* You probably didn't mean to publish `superset/assets/yarn.lock` as part of this PR\r\n* My main concern is around launching this feature, all dashboards will suddenly become invisible, I'm not sure how to mitigate this, maybe a database script that looks for all active dashboards and set them as published? An active dashboard could be defined as one that a non-owner has accessed over the past 28 days or something?\r\n* There needs to be an easy way for the owner to see the state `publish` / `not published` and to toggle it from the dashboard view itself, not from the CRUD view. We're trying to move away from our reliance on CRUD\r\n* Similar feature could be even more relevant for Charts, where the clutter is much higher, maybe apply the same consistent pattern there?\r\n* Curious to see what kind of SQL FAB generates when applying both `base_filters`, any way you can find out and share that? Let's make sure it's not doing anything crazy like running two SQL queries and showing the UNION. We should make sure this runs fast in envrionments where there are thousands of dashboards like at Airbnb.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/377647935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/377648135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4646#issuecomment-377648135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4646","id":377648135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzY0ODEzNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-30T23:53:17Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T23:53:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fabianmenges do you have the rights to merge yet?!

Rename tab could be triggered when you click on the name of the tab. `Hide toolbar` could just be a control on the page. Overall I'm still in favor of just getting rid of tabs in SQLLab all together and using the tabs of my browser.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/378047817/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/378056901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4738#issuecomment-378056901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4738","id":378056901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODA1NjkwMQ==","user":{"login":"gabe-lyons","id":2455694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2455694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons","html_url":"https://github.com/gabe-lyons","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabe-lyons/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-02T21:47:02Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T21:47:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@fabianmenges
