My understanding of the scope is to provide generic rest endpoints for users to read/write property store content no matter what format it is.\r\n> \r\n> As I said, even if we need the part of customized serializer logic, let's have one PR for customized serializer. After it has been checkedin, let's have the implementation of PropertyStore.\r\n\r\nWas confused with another PR for customized serialize. Synced up offline. This change should be self-contained.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/558350340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/558390660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/624#issuecomment-558390660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/624","id":558390660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODM5MDY2MA==","user":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T23:38:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T23:38:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@dasahcc  I did put some general information about the fixes in the PR description.\r\nHere are more detail:\r\n\r\n1- TestWorkflowControllerDataProvider:\r\nIn this test, the Tread.sleep(4000) has been used followed by multiple Assert statements to check values such as cache.getJobConfigMap().size() and cache.getWorkflowConfigMap().size(). However, Thread.sleep() is not desirable since there might be fast or slow controller threads that reach the expected values sooner/later than expected. Hence here it is preferable to used TestHelper.verify to check read these values and check them in a loop. \r\n\r\n2- TestDrop: In this test Thread.sleep has been used followed by Assert which is eliminated in this PR and has been substituted with TestHelper.verify.\r\n\r\n3- TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:\r\nThis test were rely on Thread.sleep(). This has been changed to TestHelper.verify.\r\nIn this test, one second delay has been used to make sure controller has enough time to schedule the tasks. However, this one second is not enough in most of the cases. Hence, in this PR, instead of Thread.sleep, it is better and more robust to use TestHelper.verify and count the number of scheduled task by checking their start time. If number of tasks with start time reaches the expected number of scheduled tasks, it means the test can continue to the next steps.\r\n\r\n4- TestStopWorkflow:\r\nIn this test Thread.sleep has been used to make sure all of the tasks are running. Instead of Thread.sleep, I used pollForJobState to make sure jobs are running and I also got all the tasks status in the context and checked if the tasks have reached the running state. Hence, we can be sure that the queue are in desired state after these checks. Also, previously, a global variable has been use among all the tasks to stop the tasks. Having a global variable to stop all the task might cause race condition between the tasks (concurrent get and set with different order). This has been changed to local variable.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/558390660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/558398687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/624#issuecomment-558398687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/624","id":558398687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODM5ODY4Nw==","user":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T00:08:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T00:09:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Result

Is that true? If so, should we identify and review each use case?\r\n\r\nYou are right, if anyone relies on, for example ClusterEventType.RetryRebalance, to trigger a rebalance without a cache refresh, the old application code will trigger unnecessary refresh with the new lib.\r\nAn alternative way is that we add a optional config to the Rebalance Task. So that it takes effect when it's specified, or the logic will be kept the same. But that will make the code too complicated. I would prefer not doing that since guessing the refresh requirement based on the event type is not quite decent logic anyway. But I'm open to change.\r\n@lei-xia  Could you please also comment here?

For non-shared client, we actually deliver them only when synconnected state change is notified. (This is to get the session_id for ZkClient event queue).\r\n> \r\n> To validate ZKHelixManager working, we should add two different test cases, one for participant role, and the other for controller role. At session expiration and disconnect time, the handleNewSession would be delivered correctly. No missing, no duplication and thread-safe.\r\n> \r\n> Let us add these tests.\r\n\r\nSynced up with @kaisun2000.\r\n\r\n- For ADMINISTRATOR type using shared zkclient, handleNewSessionAsParticipant or handleNewSessionAsController is not run in handle new session. There is not meaningful things to do in handle new session. So it is fine for shared zkclient.\r\n- For the other types using dedicated zkclient, existing and newly added tests already cover the cases.
