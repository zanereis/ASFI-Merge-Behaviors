now we encourage the use of compact array in most of the places. The code generator support strided cases by allowing input buffer to have a symbolic strides. However, note that performance will likely take a hit due to the inability to do runtime analysis.\r\n\r\nIf no frequent imperative slicings are needed, actually it is preferable to always use compact arrays which can simplify implementation and enable more optimizations. \r\n\r\nThe CopyFrom/ToBytes for now also explicitly requires the array to be compact. https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/6586 explicitly marks the requirement by having the function throw an error for strided case for now. TVM's native NDArray structure also generates compact array for most of the cases.\r\n\r\nWe can consider add support for CopyFrom/To in the strided array case. Notably such operation won't be cheap. We might need a StrideToCompact and StrideFromCompact function from each of the target context.

Many of the remaining issues on this PR that @imalsogreg commented on stem from the fact that `NDArray` (and `NDArrayContainer`) hide the type of the underlying data. This means that typed conversions must be given the type, and we basically have no choice but to trust it.\r\n\r\nShould we block this PR on fixing this? I'm leaning toward no.

So the return type of above function becomes a zero dim tensor. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to turn a static shape tensor to dynamic, when one of `If` branch is dynamic while other is static?

Both this example and #5130 seems to appear when the iteration is dependent on an outer loop.

It might also be useful to think about what can be done and (cannot be done) in iterator dependent loops. As the original assumption of compute means the axis should be independent from each other for certain scheduling correctness to hold. In this case, a dependent reduction bound would certainly bring different implications(for example, it no longer makes sense to reorder spatial axis and reduction), and possible different analysis for the scheduling to hold correctly.\r\n\r\nA contribution to make the enhancement for this case would be more than welcomed.
