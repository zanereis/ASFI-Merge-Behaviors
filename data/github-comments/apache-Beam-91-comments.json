This re-use meant that if you were processing elements\nA and B in parallel, you wouldn't know which ProcessContext you had and it\ncould provide inaccurate information (e.g. the window information and side\ninputs could be for the wrong element).\n\nProcessContext would need to provide guarantees that it can live outside\nthe scope of the processElement call (e.g. another thread).\n\nNow with the new DoFn and its annotation based approach, it is possible\nthat we won't need IntraBundleParallelization at all and it could be done\nautomatically. It could detect that side inputs or windows aren't accessed\nand parallelize execution when it detects a slow element call.\n\nOn Wed, Jan 18, 2017 at 9:50 AM, Scott Wegner <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> OldDoFn is the previous implementation of DoFn from Dataflow 1.x.
