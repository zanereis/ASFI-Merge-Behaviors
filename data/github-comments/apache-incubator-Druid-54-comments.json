I am more in favor of `Announcer` for internal announcements rather than `CuratorServiceAnnouncer` as its API gives more freedom on announcing stuff(Druid server metadata, leadership info, etc.) and it's already being used by Historical/Realtime to announce segments. This also means there should be an internal DruidServiceClients that discover Druid services announced internally.\n\nThat said, `CuratorServiceAnnouncer` should only be used for external discovery. Regarding announcing on a different Zookeeper cluster, we can annotate `CuratorFramework` differently for internal and external
