did a quick experiment (code below), generated a 10^20 \"UUID\"'s using a few mechanisms\n1. as you did in this pr (~120ms)\n2. an slightly different version of what is in the PR  (~55ms)\n3. using UUID with the atomic long as the low order bits (~800ms)\n4. what was there originally (~3400ms)\n5. Using JUG [1] to generate a time-based UUID (~800ms)\n\nSo, I think it is a net win with changing the method you created to return a String rather than a Long (based on 1 vs 2). On the long as a string vs UUID as a string, although it is faster by a factor of  6, I do think returning a UUID as a string may better fit the contract of the UUID core attribute. Although pretty much everywhere it is stored, it is done so as a String, the comments clearly say UUID [2]. I'm not sure the technical debt accrued for a Long vs UUID performance increase is a good trade in this instance. \n\nSide note - the JUG github page is an interesting read.

SMITH  on dev@nifi.apache.org replies:\nThanks for the prompt reply. =C2=A0\n|    | This email has been sent from a virus-free computer protected by Ava=\nst.=20\nwww.avast.com  |\n\nMy processor set isn't QPID specific, as you say it is the protocol not the=\n client provider that dictates how the connection is made to AMQP. I used t=\nhe Apache Qpid JMS client for much the same reasons as you chose RabbitMQ, =\nit was the client I had come across before and also it has been mandated at=\n work that all new AMQP brokers will use the 0.10 protocol or later, and Ra=\nbbitMQ only works with protocols upto 0.9.1 I discounted it.=C2=A0Also I fo=\nund that AMQP protocol 0.10 uses a URL and a 'destination' and these two it=\nems hold all the information required to make the connection to the broker,=\n whether that be =C2=A0with username/password or SSL.However, there are som=\ne legacy RabbitMQ brokers at work and I was asked to write a set of process=\nors to work with these brokers, initially I tried to do it all in one bundl=\ne but it started to get a bit complex so I broke them out into separate bun=\ndles.I have looked at the source for your processor set and I have noticed =\nthat we have classes with the same names and the classpaths, so I will have=\n to look at modifying mine slightly so that they don't clash. Again I would=\n value any comments when you get chance to look through my code.\nMany ThanksDave\nDavid\nGreat points and in a way confirms what I new all along. AMQP 0.9 and 1.0 m=\night as well be given different names since it is not really an evolution o=\nf one from another, but rather two different specs.=C2=A0So, what I think w=\ne would need to do is work on the same set of processors for AMQP 1.0 versi=\non as a separate bundle. You can me them the same way since really soon the=\n concept of bundle versioning will be coming to NiFi so we won=E2=80=99t be=\n dependent on names as unique identifier.\nSo if you can work on that please do so and let=E2=80=99s make it happen.=\n=C2=A0\nCheersOleg\nOleg\nThat sounds really good to me. I will try and get on with the tests asap, i=\nf you don't mind I will have a look at how you have done yours.The Apache Q=\npid Client library also includes an internal 'broker' which I found I can i=\nnstantiate in my Junit tests and hopefully this may a good way of testing t=\nhe processors.\nDave=20\n\n```\nOn Saturday, 6 February 2016, 23:04, Oleg Zhurakousky <ozhurakousky@hor=tonworks.com> wrote:\n```\n\n=20\n\n I hate spell checker. The last sentence in previous response should read c=\nompliant instead of compliment.\n\nSent from my iPhone\nr with it, but as you aware AMQP is a protocol-based specification therefor=\ne it doesn=E2=80=99t mater which client library is used as long as they are=\n compliant with the protocol version and current implementation is based on=\n AMQP 0.9.1.=20\nich one is better since as I mentioned I just went with the one I know?. As=\n far as QPID JMS, are you saying that you are using QPID JMS layer to make =\nAMQP look like JMS? If so in my experience layering JMS over AMQP while pos=\nsible brings a lot of limitations of JMS. In any event would be nice to hea=\nr your thoughts on that.\nance to look at them at the time of writing this response (will look later =\non), but do you look at them as QPID specific (i.e., QPID vs RabbitMQ)? And=\n if so what is in them that is specific to QPID? The reason why I am asking=\n (and you can see it from discussion on JIRA) is that with this effort we a=\nre aiming for processors that are compliment with specific protocol regardl=\ness of the broker implementation used, so it must be neutral.=20\nte:\ntected by Avast.=20\nibe to AMQP brokers, but I was having problems writing Junit tests for thes=\ne processors. I was interested to see that you have been working on NiFi Pu=\nll Request 865. I have looked at your code for these processors, we are bot=\nh using different property descriptors to allow messages to be published an=\nd pulled. I also noticed that you are using RabbitMQ libraries to connect t=\no the broker, whereas I connect to the AMQP broker using the QPID JMS libra=\nries. I can still see a use for my processors and I would still be interest=\ned getting my processors uploaded to run alongside yours in a future releas=\ne of NiFi.I have tidied up my code and pushed it
