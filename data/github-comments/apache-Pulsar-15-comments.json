But quick question: if topic doesn't have subscribers and publishers, then why do we want to keep inactive topic till message-retention time?\r\n\r\nI can see multiple reasons : \r\n * Consistency & semantic: If I configure the retention for 3h, I should have the data stored for (at least) 3h, irrespective of other conditions \r\n * Retention is used primarily to be able to roll-back a consumer. Right now it's possible to create a subscription (at the end of the stream) and then roll it back to a earlier point in time, but only if there are already other subscriptions, otherwise the topic would have been deleted before.\r\n * Using the Reader API, the broker doesn't control the reader position, so, when a reader is gone it doesn't retain anything on the broker side. The reader relies on the retention for the data to be available and it's vital to not delete the topic before that time expires.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/320966051/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/321027658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/641#issuecomment-321027658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/641","id":321027658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTAyNzY1OA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T17:36:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T17:36:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this one since other comments in the mailing list clarified that copyright should not go in the NOTICE file.

However, one thing to note is broker doesn't depend on `log4j2` explicitly and it loads this lib at run time as log4j2-lib gets bundled as part of binaries. \r\nso, if anyone depends directly on binary-bundle and uses default log-config then log4j will be replaced by log4j2 without any impact and \r\nif one has explicit logging-configuration and using explicit lib-packaging then they will keep using old log4j dependency only without any change so, the may not be impacted.\r\n\r\n> Should we land this on 1.20? We should probably make it clear what won't change on 1.x releases.\r\n\r\nyes, we can decide if we want to take as part of 1.20 or later releases with proper notice in documentation. @merlimat  any thought on it?

I'm worried about this \"Oops\" case. I guess many people don't read release notes when they update packages because they know (or expect) that new version works without any changes as long as they use the same major version. Not a few packages make it possible by running migration scripts during installation or keeping compatibility strictly through one major version. Without any of these, \"Oops\" happens.
