@JingsongLi,\r\nI love that you are putting so much work into the Flink runner but I think before changing this we need to tackle to other issues that I just created: \r\n -

TimerInternals\r\n\r\nwhere the latter depends on the former. This will actually also simplify the implementation. Are you interested in working on those first?\r\n\r\nFor avoiding duplicate/redundant work it's good to mention that you are working on a Jira Issue and also to assign that issue to yourself. This way other people can now that you are working on something and won't do duplicate work.\r\n\r\nJira is also good for discussing implementation details.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work. üòÑ üëç And
