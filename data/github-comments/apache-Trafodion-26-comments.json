So we have to create A without partition as workaround.\nDebug for a while, here  is what I understand: To find out if RI is meet, the 'insert into b' statement will generate a query to search in table A, but this new query has a problem to add all key columns, if there are some Trafodion auto-generated colunns like '_SALT_', since at the left side of the predicate, it only add the FK column in table B, but at right side, it add referenced column with those system columns, but the predicate cannot calculate the SALT at this point. It can caculate SALT at this point, but it is much difficult, so simply remove those column is the simplest way to solve this.  \nIt is hard to explain, since I am not fully understand all the logic here, so yes, I should test

My guess is that we use the clustering key on the right side. What we should be using is the primary key - just those columns mentioned in the PRIMARY KEY clause. That would be the ideal fix, but using the NAColumn methods and exclusing salt and division columns should work as well.\n\nThanks for fixing this!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/190488133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/190490855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/348#issuecomment-190490855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/348","id":190490855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDQ5MDg1NQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T01:51:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T01:51:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New

This code can be committed before the initialize changes are completed.  A new JIRA will be written for this work - here are the planned changes:\n\nAdd an “initialize trafodion, init_procedures” option – If someone want this feature, they will just need to perform this command\n\n(Since the schema below is a system schema, to follow the naming convention of other system schemas, the name should be something like \"_LIBMGR_\" but I could also support \"DB__LIBMGR\".)\n\nThe init_procedures option:\n\n Creates a private schema DB__LIBMGR  owned by DB__ROOT\n Creates library called DB__LIBMGRNAME in the DB__LIBMGR schema. The corresponding jar file is located: ${MY_SQROOT}/export/lib/lib_mgmt.jar\n      (assume this jar file exists when the library is created – it not operation fails)\n  Creates all the routines described in the init_libmgmt.sh script\n  If authorization is enabled: call “initialize authorization, upgrade” to complete the request\n\n  If the schema, library, routines, and privileges are already setup, this command is a no-op and returns “okay”.\n\nChange “initialize trafodion, upgrade” command - The next time we support an upgrade, this will upgrade a system that did not yet perform an “init_procedures” - this can also be postponed until we support an official upgrade\n\nPerform the same steps as init_procedures does – create the schema, libraries, and procedures.  Then upgrade authorization.\n\nChange “initialize trafodion” command – this is a fresh installation\n\nBefore initializing authorization,  create the schema, library and routines\nThen continue with initializing authorization\n\nChange “initialize authorization, upgrade” - \n\nCreate the DB_LIBMGRROLE – if not exists\nGrant execute privilege on routines, if the routines exist\n\nChange “initialize authorization” to \n\nCreate the DB_LIBMGRROLE – if not exists\nGrant execute privilege on routines, if the routines exist\n\nSince SPJ’s are initialized during “initialize trafodion”, all regressions run through daily builds will work.\nHowever, for environments that do not perform an “initialize trafodion”, then a manual ““initialize trafodion, init_procedures” is required.  Any regression tests that use this feature should include the “initialize trafodion, init_procedures” command.  If they are already initialized, this is a no-op.\n\nSince routines may change more frequently than upgrades, need to think a bit about how to make it easy to add, drop and modify these functions and procedures.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/190513204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/190515289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/348#issuecomment-190515289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/348","id":190515289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MDUxNTI4OQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-01T03:15:15Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T03:15:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New

For me, the question is what the SQL semantics of an upsert are supposed to be. I think it's ok to define it in the way that TRAF_UPSERT_WITH_INSERT_DEFAULT_SEMANTICS 'ON' does. So, I would argue that we could leave this CQD set to ON as the built-in default. The current solution, OFF, is ok with me as well.\n\nMy reason to argue for the ON semantics is this: If the user wanted to merge new and existing rows, they should use the MERGE statement, not UPSERT. UPSERT, IMHO, should insert or replace entire rows, not merge old and new rows.
