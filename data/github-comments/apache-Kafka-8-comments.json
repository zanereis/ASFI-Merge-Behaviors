anything.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135908565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135916524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/151#issuecomment-135916524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/151","id":135916524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTkxNjUyNA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T23:52:09Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T23:52:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tests

Updated to use the new approach to offsets we discussed. Also updated system test to be parameterized and test JSON and String serializers, including JSON with schemas and without schemas. Hopefully this covers enough bases that it's fairly good confirmation that we can make this work.\n\nI'm honestly not enthusiastic about how the code for reading offsets looks since it's a bunch of checking for nulls and validating specific types, but maybe this is the best solution when we have to balance data with good schemas vs schemaless data.\n\nI'm thinking maybe we can provide some utilities for converting maps with string fields to structs with some basic checks in place so it'll make connector implementors jobs' easier.

that?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135939553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135942342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/172#issuecomment-135942342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/172","id":135942342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTk0MjM0Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-29T05:06:06Z","updated_at":"2015-08-29T05:06:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr

Currently the mirror maker sanity check is not passing for me (though it seems it is broken on trunk, not by this PR).

ConsumerPerformance directly (after running the test with `--no-teardown` option),  I consistently see 11 - 13 `val records = consumer.poll(100)` before any calls to `poll` yield any records.\n\nIn other words, slightly more than 1000ms before `poll` yields non-zero results, and therefore the loop is timing out.\n\nI had a 2 second timeout here so the loop wouldn't quit before poll received

Below is the description of the problem and fix.\n\nJmxTool should allow user to query all existing objects and attributes, such that the developer can quickly lookup the right object name and attribute name in the output. Indeed, existing API of JmxTool allows user to do this when object-name is not specified in argument.\n\nHowever, existing implementation of JmxTool doesn't allow this operation. To see this, suppose you run kafka locally with JMX_PORT=9202, you get no output by doing \"kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.JmxTool --jmx-url service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://127.0.0.1:9202/jmxrm\"\n\nThis is because some JMX object, such as java.lang:type=MemoryPool, doesn't have value for all its attributes. You might have an attribute that appears in mbsc.getMBeanInfo(name).getAttributes, but its value will not appear in mbsc.getAttributes(name, mbsc.getMBeanInfo(name).getAttributes.map(_.getName)).\n\nTo fix the problem, we just need to correct the way numExpectedAttributes is calculated so that it counts the number of attributes that actually has a value. This patches does exactly this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/136801681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/136807774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/184#issuecomment-136807774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/184","id":136807774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjgwNzc3NA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T17:40:51Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T17:40:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sslavic I think you got the JIRA number wrong here, the PR title and commit message should be for KAFKA-2492.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/136807774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/136808793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/176#issuecomment-136808793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/176","id":136808793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjgwODc5Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T17:42:55Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T17:42:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #289](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/289/) FAILURE\nLooks like there's a problem with this pull request\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/136808793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/136811598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/158#issuecomment-136811598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/158","id":136811598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjgxMTU5OA==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T17:54:15Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T17:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good overall.

Also, the `==` works because the JVM does a good job of interning the Strings, but this is not the right way of performing comparison between objects in Java. \n\nAll in all, those are bugs lurking to happen, and I only stumbled upon by chance as MockClient. Do you think it's worth trying to devise an assertion that expose at least the collection flaw? I am fine with this approach, committing as-is today, or even dropping this PR. :)
