But I could be wrong about this. @galen-pivotal created the original GEODE-5314 ticket and he may know of how multiple threads can update these classes. I think @kirklund has more knowledge of these classes so it could be helpful to get his input.\r\nIf they are used concurrently then I don't think atomics, adders, and/or concurrentMaps would solve all the concurrency issues. The way the old value in the map is used to decrement the atomic and then later the new value is used to inc the atomic and update the map seems to need to be done all in one \"transaction\". The easiest way to do this and know the code is safe would be to do this all under synchronization. You should only introduce concurrent structures if you need to optimize concurrent writers. You could also do the reads under synchronization but I could see how that would have performance concerns if you have multiple readers or don't want a reader to be blocked by a writer. I think that might be what led the code to use volatiles originally. Kirk or someone else might have a better handle on how these classes are used.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/414375830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/414380390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2250#issuecomment-414380390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2250","id":414380390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDM4MDM5MA==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-20T16:33:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T17:48:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jujoramos

It seems like some methods that didn't really change just got moved to a different part of the file.

I' aware that this is just a matter of preference and that currently the `spotless` plugin doesn't take into consideration these patterns, but I'd prefer to keep the order this way, it makes the classes easier to read and maintain. Either way, I can revert them back so only the actual changes are shown in the `diff`, just let me
