It gets a CuratorZKClient, which calls checkTimeouts (getting the ConnectionState monitor). The connection is gone, and so reset() gets called, then HandleHolder calls ZK.close, which then calls ZKClientCnxn.close. </p>\n\n<p>This calls submitRequest which queues a \"disconnect\" packet, then wait()'s on the packet object. </p>\n\n<p>This wait() will only get notified when the packet is dequeued and notifyAll() is called in finishPacket(). When this thread calls wait(), it releases the monitor lock on the Packet object, but keeps the other two monitors that it has, one on the ConnectionState object, and another on the Zookeeper object itself. </p>\n\n<p>During this wait, the SendThread (either already running or wakes up, whatever). Throws an exception, which trickles through to cleanup().</p>\n\n<p>inside cleanup(), the pending queue is drained, calling conLossPacket, then finishPacket(). </p>\n\n<p>Because they're pending aysnc packets, eventThread.queuePacket() is called on the pending async packet. We call the callback, which in turn trickles back up to (in this case) the CreateBuilderImpl AsyncCallback.StringCallback's processResult, which then tries to submit another event, which will never get processed, because in order to get the ZKClient again, we call getZookeeperClient, which will try to get the ConnectionState monitor lock that Thread A has.  </p>\n\n<p>It will wait for that, never dequeuing, processing and notifying the \"disconnect\" packet that Thread A is waiting on.</p>\n\n<p>So this would only happen if there was a pending async packet in the queue when disconnect happened, AND the async callback tries to make another ZK call.</p>\n\n<p>I think I can reproduce this with a small test, I'll see what I can come up with in the next day or two.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604718782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604718784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/693#issuecomment-2604718784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/693","id":2604718784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3MTg3ODQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T23:04:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:20:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kylar\">kylar</a>:</i>\n<p>In my case, I think Thread A might be the Background thread.
