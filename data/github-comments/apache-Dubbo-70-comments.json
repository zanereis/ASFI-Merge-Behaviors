我同意您的说法，Dubbo容器不局限于Spring，可能我描述不太好，Spring容器是一个典型场景。\r\n2. 确实您没有正面回答我的问题，那么我描述下2.6.3版本停机在如下场景下存在问题：如果应用程序通过停机hook触发，DubboShutDown Hook会调用destroyAll方法，因为容器（比如Spring）也通过Hook停机，此时Spirng会提前关闭，可能导致dubbo方法内部无法获取业务Bean。因为多个hook的执行的无序性，destroyAll方法第二次执行会立即返回，所以可能导致容器先摧毁。\r\n3.

确实您没有正面回答我的问题，那么我描述下2.6.3版本停机在如下场景下存在问题：如果应用程序通过停机hook触发，DubboShutDown Hook会调用destroyAll方法，因为容器（比如Spring）也通过Hook停机，此时Spirng会提前关闭，可能导致dubbo方法内部无法获取业务Bean。因为多个hook的执行的无序性，destroyAll方法第二次执行会立即返回，所以可能导致容器先摧毁。\r\n\r\nNo, if you are using Dubbo 2.6.3 with Spring, Dubbo's Shutdown hook should never be registered.\r\nAll the shutdown logic should be triggered by Spring's Shutdown hook.\r\nIf you found that the code is not working as expected, please file an issue and provide steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nFor question 3, I am not aware of that change.

我使用的是JDK 1.8.0_05，dubbo-admin版本是2.5.4-SNAPSHOT，也遇到了一样的问题。解决方案如@ddatsh：\r\n> \r\n> 1，WEBX的依赖改为3.1.6版;\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     <dependency>\r\n>         <groupId>com.alibaba.citrus</groupId>\r\n>         <artifactId>citrus-webx-all</artifactId>\r\n>         <version>3.1.6</version>\r\n>     </dependency>\r\n> ```\r\n> 2，添加速度的依赖，我用了1.7;\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     <dependency>\r\n>         <groupId>org.apache.velocity</groupId>\r\n>         <artifactId>velocity</artifactId>\r\n>         <version>1.7</version>\r\n>     </dependency>\r\n> ```\r\n> 3，对依赖项达博添加排斥，避免引入旧弹簧\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     <dependency>\r\n>         <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>\r\n>         <artifactId>dubbo</artifactId>\r\n>         <version>${project.parent.version}</version>\r\n>         <exclusions>\r\n>

</dependency>\r\n> ```\r\n> 4，webx已有spring 3以上的依赖，因此注释掉dubbo-admin里面的spring依赖\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     <!--<dependency>-->\r\n>         <!--<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>-->\r\n>         <!--<artifactId>spring</artifactId>-->\r\n>     <!--</dependency>-->\r\n> ```\r\n> 确定war包解压后lib目录没有spring 3以下的依赖就行。然后运行正常了。\r\n\r\n\r\njdk1.8.0_181\r\ntomcat8.5.34\r\ndubbo-admin2.5.4（从git下载
