We can defer it for the future as well, but I think maybe it's worth starting now.\r\n\r\nSince we are starting to use more linters, I thought maybe we could already switch to using pre-commit-hook framework for those linters.\r\n\r\nhttps://pre-commit.com/\r\n\r\nIt allows to run checks on CI but (what is more important) it can run the very same checks as pre-commit-hooks. It is really nicely implemented - has nice UI, allows to add many ready-to-use linters and checkers (and some automated code modification like adding licence headers) and it is super-easy to install locally by the developer. And it has pluginable interface where it can already (I believe) filters only changed files (not lines by default though). \r\n\r\nAs local pre-commit check, It could be run as pre-commit for all locally modified files, so that people are encouraged to fix error faster. And on Travis we could continue checking only modified lines for example. \r\n\r\nI think you could fairly easily turn your python script into a pre-commit plugin rather than have a standalone script and then we could benefit from being able to run the checks with pre-commit hooks (which is far better than waiting for Travis).\r\n\r\nI discovered it recently and applied successfully to the Ooozie2Airflow converter we work on - we applied some 20+ checks. You can see for example here: \r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-composer/builds/528367055#L1638\r\n\r\nAnd here is the list of checks we have implemented in our

I think checking only changed lines is the fastest way to have some form of Pylint in Airflow, and then we (the community) can work on making all code compatible in the meantime.\r\n\r\nSince checking only changed lines is a bit messy and requires these extra scripts, another option is to first make everything compatible, touch 99% of the codebase in a single PR (or split up PRs per module/package) and then enable Pylint in the CI afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/489460775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/489461412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5238#issuecomment-489461412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5238","id":489461412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQ2MTQxMg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-05T20:38:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-05T20:38:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree the per-line script is pretty messy. I'd be all for making a big pylint update (but then a lot of PRs will have merge conflicts). And we will have a lot of problems with merging stuff to v1-10* branches. But maybe it's worth it :). As long as we provide some tools for all the contributors to fix/test their changes locally (like pre-commit hooks), maybe it's the best way to implement it. \r\n\r\nIt's a bit harsh, but maybe we can run this through community and ask them for feedback what they think about it ? I think personally it's the best way of introducing such changes - rather than fix everything, give all the contributors the tools and support in case of questions (like be ready to quickly answer questions - whether we should disable a rule or fix this particular case) and let them convert their PRs in a distributed fashion on their own.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/489461412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/489475037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5030#issuecomment-489475037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5030","id":489475037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTQ3NTAzNw==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T00:03:45Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T00:03:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```bash\r\n02:01 $ grep -RE 'namedtuple\\(' . --include \\*.py\r\n./tests/models/test_connection.py:ConnectionParts = namedtuple(\"ConnectionParts\", [\"conn_type\", \"login\", \"password\", \"host\", \"port\", \"schema\"])\r\n./tests/contrib/hooks/test_azure_container_instance_hook.py:        named_instance = namedtuple(\"InstanceView\", instance_view.keys())(*instance_view.values())\r\n./tests/contrib/hooks/test_azure_container_instance_hook.py:        named_instance = namedtuple(\"Events\", instance_view.keys())(*instance_view.values())\r\n./tests/contrib/hooks/test_wasb_hook.py:        Blob = namedtuple('Blob', ['name'])\r\n```\r\nIt seems to me that all classes have not been changed.

We intend to run Kubeflow and Airflow side by side as they fit different needs.\r\n\r\n@feng-tao it’s not too hard actually. It already uses a plugin construct, so you just need to adhere to the API. We need to come up with a Metadata model that fits Airflow, but also can interface with the outside world in order to have end2end lineage. Ie. Spark generates its own lineage (for Atlas), for us it’s important to be able to connect what Airflow does with Spark. In the Neo4J case you don’t have the lineage that Spark (or Hive for that matter) provides so Airflow needs to fill that gap. \r\n\r\nFrom that point of view your integration, at the moment, is actually *simpler* cause you don’t have that interfacing requirement, yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/490247174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/490250234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4068#issuecomment-490250234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4068","id":490250234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDI1MDIzNA==","user":{"login":"kyle-hamlin","id":4634087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4634087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin","html_url":"https://github.com/kyle-hamlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyle-hamlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T20:50:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T20:50:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@oelesinsc24 @Fokko @ashb Any update on this PR?

Am I correct to assume this could be used e.g. when you have data continuously appending, and _some_ DAG run might pick it up, regardless which number it is?\r\n\r\nSo do I understand this correctly?\r\n\r\n- If you have a DAG running every 1 day\r\n- You have DAG runs 1, 2 and 3\r\n- DAG run 1 takes 1,5 days to complete\r\n- Therefore DAG run 2 will start while DAG run 1 still has running tasks, and this operator will skip the downstream tasks in DAG run 2\r\n- In DAG run 3 (starting on day 3), all tasks from day 1 have completed, and therefore all tasks will
