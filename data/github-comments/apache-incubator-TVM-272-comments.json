The Python script doesn't work and complains about \"Invalid target\". Then I checked the source code [`src/target/target_id.cc`](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/44ff1f3b5ed0751fee39537a0e6e3870a74c930b/src/target/target_id.cc#L351) and found that it doesn't accept `target` as an attribute. I add a line, `    .add_attr_option<String>(\"target\")`, then the script can generate `.o` and `.a` files successfully, but the static library was rejected by `wasm-graph`. I think this is because the generated library is **ELF 64** rather than WASM bytecode, and it cannot be linked to wasi32 `wasm-graph`.\r\n\r\nCan you build the project at your end? If you or anyone else in this community can give me some advice and finally I build that application, I'll be happy to commit a PR and help polish this part.

Sorry was being late on this. I think it worthwhile to think a bit more.  In general, there are two kinds of information  that we normally carry throughout the program:\r\n\r\n- K0: The information in the declaration/allocation site\r\n- K1: The information that carries as part of type (of the Var) which is being used through out the usage site in the code base.\r\n\r\nThe Buffer object was intended for the declaration site information. There are in general two kinds of design choices here:\r\n\r\n- C0: On one hand, the information being present in the declaration site K0 can be duplicated with the information present in the allocation site, so we could remove the duplication (for example, dtype and scope are duplicated in the type atm).\r\n- C1: On the other hand, one could argue that the type annotation should be made independent from the type annotation that also shares with the usage site, so we could let the allocation site contain a duplicated set of information and check consistency during construction.\r\n\r\nRight now this PR follows C0 partially. I wonder if we should also consider the choice between C0 and C1. In the particular case of Buffer, I feel that we should give C1 a serious consideration. \r\n\r\nWe can also use the text format to illustrate the potential differences between the

Given that this will bring a non-trival change to the key TIR data structure, it might be worth discussing it first. I realized that it was touched a bit in the USMP RFC but slipped through since initially I thought it was a feature proposal without touching the IR itself. We can open a new discussion thread or followup on that thread.\r\n\r\nIn particular, up until now we have avoided the constant node in the low level because the specific implementation can really differ in different backends. Specific allocations might and data copy might be needed on devices with special memory. So from the general architecture PoV we want to avoid the allocate constant node. But instead have a way to point to the global data section.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to discuss the motivation and possible alternatives. My understanding is that we have a potential need to embed parameters into the data segments. We might be able to do things differently. e.g. introduce a constant data segment to IRModule and allow TIR to refer to these global Vars.\r\n\r\ncc @areusch @manupa-arm who I believe was previously involved in the conversation.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880126991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880132196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8469#issuecomment-880132196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8469","id":880132196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDEzMjE5Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-14T18:55:31Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T18:55:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"given the particular pass can be applied to any TIR Module, we might be able to just put it under tir namespace withour introducing the usmp namespace.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880132196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880133287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8447#issuecomment-880133287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8447","id":880133287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDEzMzI4Nw==","user":{"login":"vvchernov","id":28704584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzA0NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28704584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov","html_url":"https://github.com/vvchernov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvchernov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-14T18:57:18Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T18:57:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@masahi I followed your recommendation and tvm-ci passed successfully.

It seems that all modification of LSTM supported by pytorch are supported on tvm side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880133287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880150504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8472#issuecomment-880150504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8472","id":880150504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDE1MDUwNA==","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-14T19:26:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T19:27:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @tqchen ,\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look at this.\r\n\r\nOur initial plan is to use this to support link-param implementation via faithfully expressing them in the TIR -- thus it could get lowered to using current link-param code generation (There is a subsequent PR to this effect). In a way, this will \"bound\" to IR only if the user provides link-param argument. If the specific implementation requires, the constants to be specially handled in the application layer, we think that is use-case where --link-params is not provided, in which case FuseOps will lift the constant tensor out of the IR into arguments (p0, p1, etc)\r\n\r\nOne of the motivation, this allows compiled constant artifacts to be expressed in the IR (e.g. compressed weights).

Changing the IR definition can create a bigger impact than attaching optional attrs etc. Since the new node introduce semantics that existing passes may not taken into account. So it would be indeed great to put some thoughts into this.  We need to put extra care into this to maintain architecture consistency across all the sub areas of interest.\r\n\r\nMy current read is that the function attrs approach can also be used to run the same optimization mentioned(pooling the constant). Except that rewrite needs to be done which takes the function attrs and intrinsics.  I would still recommend us take that route first. \r\n\r\nGiven the common need of embedding artifacts, we might want to find a way to express global constant artifact in the IRModule, perhaps as `Map<GlobalVar, DataSegment>`, and referring them in the IR. This way could be cleaner than inlining the constant directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880203373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880214469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8472#issuecomment-880214469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8472","id":880214469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDIxNDQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-14T21:14:08Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T21:24:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmmm, we do view the tir.allocate_const having closer semantics to tir.allocate, the difference being the former have data inside of it unlike the tir.allocate.\r\n\r\nThe existing TIR anyway treats non-scalar constant data as opaque vars passed in, therefore, I dont quite follow why existing passes get effected.

  On the other hand, one could argue that the type annotation should be made independent from the type annotation that also shares with the usage site, so we could let the allocation site contain a duplicated set of information and check consistency during construction\r\n\r\nI think if duplicated information are supposed to be consistent, then they are already not independent. So I don't see an advantage in keeping track of two essentially the same information.\r\n\r\nTo @jroesch's question, right now our code base uses two ways to create `Buffer`:\r\n1. Via `decl_buffer` function. Here, a buffer variable (with its `PointerType`) is constructed at the same time as `Buffer`. So we can make sure that two storage scopes agree (Although currently we don't pass `storage_scope` to `Buffer` constructor).\r\n https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/tir/ir/buffer.cc#L48-L53 \r\n\r\n2. Via `Buffer` constructor directly, using a buffer variable already constructed. https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/tir/ir/buffer.cc#L386-L388 Here, it is possible to have a situation where the storage scope recorded in the buffer variable is different from the one in `Buffer` constructor. In particular, if the former one is empty while the latter one is non trivial scope (`shared`, `local` etc), I would say this is a bug in creating the original buffer variable with empty scope. If we want to allow such usage while keeping the two scope consistent, we need to update the scope in buffer variable (which is not simple). Right now we don't have such usage in the code base, so I chose to drop `scope` argument from the `Buffer` constructor` to prevent misuse.\r\n\r\nOne possible middle ground is to keep `scope` member of `Buffer`, but drop it from the constructor and instead initialize it with the scope in the buffer variable (`data` in the code). This might be better in terms of design, in that we also have `dtype` duplicated. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880346762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880409204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8443#issuecomment-880409204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8443","id":880409204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MDQwOTIwNA==","user":{"login":"delldu","id":31266222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjY2MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31266222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu","html_url":"https://github.com/delldu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-15T05:34:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T05:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @delldu I don't see a need to support scripting for these ops, so can you simplify this PR?

@d-smirnov I believe your primary goal as I understand it is to encode the constant data in TIR so that post-scheduling visitors can modify the IR and the data based on whole-program analysis prior to exporting the model parameters, is that correct? it would be great to capture this in an e.g. RFC or design doc. I agree that `--link-params` constants are a reasonable place to start. I'm not sure what the right IR construct is, but perhaps we could consider it in terms of this longer-term goal rather than the immediate goal of extracting `--link-params` from TIR constants.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, params were fetched by the executor. With AOT, we now have the option to encode much of the executor logic in TIR; this means though that we need to be careful not to over-complicate the various codegen. I think this latter concern isn't generally a problem if we are judicious with the things we add to TIR. Finally, we need to ensure that post-scheduling visitors won't break given the new TIR nodes. Given constants are not currently encoded in post-schedule TIR, I think the main case we need to consider is when a pass expected to find params by inspecting a PrimFunc param, but now needs to also inspect something else.\r\n\r\nI agree with @tqchen it would be good to discuss the longer-term vision on the forum or with an RFC, even if it is small. We also need to consider how other executors could be coupled with passes that modify the constant data. We don't want to create special cases in TIR for specific executors when we don't need to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/880994200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881017518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8463#issuecomment-881017518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8463","id":881017518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MTAxNzUxOA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-15T21:13:42Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T21:14:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@csullivan As of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8366, all buffer vars should be of pointer type.

While it is indeed possible that adding a new TIR node won't impact the current flow, changing the IR data structure itself is indeed a major architecture change that we need to think more thouroughly. Since a stable set of IR data structure and semantics would help us in the long run.\r\n\r\nJust want to clarify the situations. We can also roughly map the solutions to:\r\n\r\n- C3: Introduce a new IR node\r\n- C2: embed into attrs, but allow attrs to refer to the IR node\r\n- C1: embed as meta data and use instrinsics to refer to it.\r\n\r\nFor the particular application in mind usually, C3 certainly brings the least amount of indirection. However, it also brings deeper surgery to the IR architecture itself. In the extreme case, one might fall into a that introduces new IR node for each kind of application to touch meta-data.\r\n\r\nThe main possible problem in C2 is that we want to make sure meta data in attrs remains constant during rewrite, so that the `my_param_var` won't get rewritten to something else, and passes does not need to consider the context to check if all variables are bound.\r\n\r\nC1 is the approach that falls within the current architecture of meta data handling. While I agree that it may not be the most direct option at the moment, it will bring the least amount of impact to the TIR architecture itself. We also want to make sure that the metadata handling mechanism works for cases like this and possible future ones, and improvement if things does not work out well.\r\n\r\nPopping up a level, we want to carefully think about the general need to referring to a constant meta data, and perhaps build some more native mechanism than C1, but also generalizes the particular case of allocate_const. For example,  maybe we want to allow relay and TIR to share a same mechanism of such constant data reference. That is the long term solution that we might want to think about along the directions(e.g. bring the constant map as part of IRModule).\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881068098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881083777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8407#issuecomment-881083777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8407","id":881083777,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40hEWB","user":{"login":"schell","id":24942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell","html_url":"https://github.com/schell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T00:03:22Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T00:03:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like it ran successfully.

For the discussion, I feel its better to have it here rather than going back and forth via discuss forum -- so its easier for reader to follow the discussion later.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure what the right IR construct is, but perhaps we could consider it in terms of this longer-term goal rather than the immediate goal of extracting --link-params from TIR constants.\r\n\r\nAgreed, though --link-params kind of mean to bind the params to the IR --> then to the codegeneration of operators itself (unless they are pooled and pulled out). Yes, the subsequent PR will support the code generation as well for linked constants :).\r\n\r\n> Given constants are not currently encoded in post-schedule TIR, I think the main case we need to consider is when a pass expected to find params by inspecting a PrimFunc param, but now needs to also inspect something else.\r\n\r\nI dont believe this (a pass expected to find params by inspecting a PrimFunc param) is possible until we embed the constants in TIR for TIR passes.\r\n\r\n> We also need to consider how other executors could be coupled with passes that modify the constant data. We don't want to create special cases in TIR for specific executors when we don't need to.\r\n\r\nAgreed. Actually, the work we are trying to do here makes the params insensitive to the executors when the user wants them linked to the operators. Therefore, we dont see how embeddeding constants to TIR is executor specific.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881193901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881221104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8477#issuecomment-881221104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8477","id":881221104,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40hl3w","user":{"login":"huajsj","id":2281489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2281489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj","html_url":"https://github.com/huajsj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T06:53:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T06:53:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, Thanks @apivovarov for the fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881221104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881290079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8476#issuecomment-881290079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8476","id":881290079,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40h2tf","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T08:57:41Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T08:57:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mshr-h!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881290079/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881293661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8464#issuecomment-881293661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8464","id":881293661,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40h3ld","user":{"login":"leo-blonk","id":52416576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDE2NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52416576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk","html_url":"https://github.com/leo-blonk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T09:03:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T09:03:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll have a look.

However, it also brings deeper surgery to the IR architecture itself. In the extreme case, one might fall into a that introduces new IR node for each kind of application to touch meta-data.\r\n\r\nI think it should be stated --link-params are just one of useful usage of having the ability to express constant data in TIR. However, having the ability to express constant in TIR allows to introduce constants that are properties of the operators, mutations required by the HW, etc. Therefore, this is an extension of the IR rather than a surgery to the IR. I'd view surgery as rooting out an established TIR construct and relocating/redefining with to support more features/usecases. Moreover, the process of compilation for variety of targets will include many constants that undergoes different transformation for optimization and also to be prepared as requirement for the HW to execute/decode them.\r\n\r\nI think we could agree that having to introduce an IR node for each meta-data (of the model) might not be desirable. However, we feel ability to express constants in the TIR goes beyond them being meta-data (for ones to be considered meta-data). This is because the constants does not necessarily are meta-data of the model.  Frankly, Im not even sure why we call constants involved in a computation as meta-data ?\r\n\r\nTherefore, its better to understand why we are categorizing constant non-scalar data as meta-data (always) is quite important in making the decision.\r\n\r\n> The main possible problem in C2 is that we want to make sure meta data in attrs remains constant during rewrite, so that the my_param_var won't get rewritten to something else, and passes does not need to consider the context to check if all variables are bound.\r\n\r\nSo to summarize, the tir builtin will provide a write-acess restriction, correct? I feel that is an overkill where we should use a 'const' specifier (or qualify the buffer_var to just loadable and not storeable) to restrict if thats required. Then again, not sure what value it brings because users will not write TIR directly -- unlike 'const' specifier in other languages.\r\n\r\n> C1 is the approach that falls within the current architecture of meta data handling. While I agree that it may not be the most direct option at the moment, it will bring the least amount of impact to the TIR architecture itself. We also want to make sure that the metadata handling mechanism works for cases like this and possible future ones, and improvement if things does not work out well.\r\n\r\nI'd agree with this if we have good reasons why constant non-scalar data is always treated as metadata. That is dependent on the resolution for the above point. Then again, I think we should welcome positive extention to the IR which does not involve a surgery.\r\n\r\n> Popping up a level, we want to carefully think about the general need to referring to a constant meta data, and perhaps build some more native mechanism than C1, but also generalizes the particular case of allocate_const. For example, maybe we want to allow relay and TIR to share a same mechanism of such constant data reference. That is the long term solution that we might want to think about along the directions(e.g. bring the constant map as part of IRModule).\r\n\r\nWhile all meta-data are constants, we would need to think whether all constants are meta-data :) . Again, related to the same point above. \r\n\r\nLet say, we had good reasons to decide all constants are meta-data. Then, we'd propose not to pull out constants that are accessed by primfuncs early on to IRModule scope -- that could happen later. This allows different compilation flows to contribute the constants for global optimizations later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881370674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881405667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8466#issuecomment-881405667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8466","id":881405667,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40iS7j","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T12:19:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T12:19:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @masahi I left some comments, also cc @Hzfengsy @vinx13 so they are also aware","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881405667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881416472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8472#issuecomment-881416472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8472","id":881416472,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40iVkY","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T12:38:12Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T12:38:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @manupa-arm . I totally agree that we need to evolve the IR design itself. Constants are indeed special, that would require some careful thinking, I just meant to say that it would take more thoughts and possibly some lessons in less impactful way(e.g. the attribute approach)\r\n\r\nFor example,  assume that if we decided that it is a good idea to introduce constant in TIR, there are quite a few set of  considerations that needs to go into them:\r\n- Q0: What is the interaction model with the high level TIR schedule(e.g. do we need to allocate multi dimensional constant buffer)\r\n- Q1: What if we want to express constant that are shared across functions(in which case inling the data may not be the right approach)\r\n- Q2: What is the semantics (when the scope itself is special and requires the loading pattern).\r\n\r\nDifferent considerations of the above Qs might come to a different conclusions. For example, considering Q1 we may not inline the data into the allocate_const node. It would be important to make an informed choice at some time point and stick with that one and avoid introducing a node then change it later.\r\n\r\nOur current consideration to constants so far is that most of the transformations happens at the relay level, and at the level of TIR, there are a diverse set of operations involved to allocate, initialize load the constant before use, and it may be hard to converge on a single Q2. As a result, we usually  represent constant as a var.\r\n\r\nSo to summarize:\r\n- We understand it is important to keep an eye on how do we handle and transform constant that might bring architecture changes. \r\n- Because it is hard to make an immediate choice, and we can start with an less impactful approach via attrs, we could unblock by going with that approach.\r\n- Once we have learnt enough lessons, we can then come back and revisit this matter, introducing architecture changes to the IR or IRModule.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881416472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881479534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8443#issuecomment-881479534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8443","id":881479534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40ik9u","user":{"login":"delldu","id":31266222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjY2MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31266222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu","html_url":"https://github.com/delldu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delldu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T14:10:31Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T14:10:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[log.txt](https://github.com/apache/tvm/files/6831216/log.txt)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881479534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/881550254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8464#issuecomment-881550254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8464","id":881550254,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM40i2Ou","user":{"login":"leo-blonk","id":52416576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDE2NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52416576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk","html_url":"https://github.com/leo-blonk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leo-blonk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T15:56:12Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T15:56:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The hashes need to be updated.
