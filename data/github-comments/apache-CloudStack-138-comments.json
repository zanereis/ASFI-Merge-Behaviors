It is in black and white in Section 2.3 of our bylaws and the Apache Way.  As I said in my previous comment, no one ever agreed that only RMs could commit to release branches.  We agreed to the criteria for a PR to be merged.  By nature of his deep involvement, Remi ended up merging all PRs because he was so active.  However, that circumstance did not imply that committers had relinquished their rights under our bylaws.\n\nblueorganatan was under development until we had a hardware failure in the lab.

Some observations regarding the tests.\nI see that you have put the tests under solidfire folder. Currently is solidfire the only managed storage provider? Do you think the test can be easily reused with another managed storage by just changing some configuration? Also there are system VM (SSVM) related smoke tests. Please see if you can run them with solidfire as primary store.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247310771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247318630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1645#issuecomment-247318630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1645","id":247318630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzMxODYzMA==","user":{"login":"kiwiflyer","id":17278194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjc4MTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17278194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer","html_url":"https://github.com/kiwiflyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T12:49:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T12:49:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@karuturi  - So, note that this feature addition only affects KVM when using RBD as the back-end storage. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247318630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247319836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1642#issuecomment-247319836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1642","id":247319836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzMxOTgzNg==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T12:54:43Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T12:54:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@koushik-das didn't notice that path, but completely agree.

I see the following items to be addressed in order to get this PR merged:\n- [ ] Squash commits\n- [ ] Re-point the PR to the 4.8 release branch -- the change will be merged forward to 4.9 and master as part of the PR merge\n- [ ] Create a JIRA ticket describing the bug and update the commit comments to reference it\n\nSince we are going to have one more 4.8 release, this fix seems like it would be good for the as well.  Therefore, I adjusted to the target of this PR to the 4.8 branch.  We are going to be cutting RCs for 4.8.2.0, 4.9.1.0, and 4.10.0.0 in on 25 Sept 2016.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247840250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247840389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1652#issuecomment-247840389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1652","id":247840389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Nzg0MDM4OQ==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-18T10:43:44Z","updated_at":"2016-09-18T10:43:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@PaulAngus following up on PR feedback.  @fmaximus did you apply this patch in another PR?
