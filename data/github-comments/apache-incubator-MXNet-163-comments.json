I can post the debug message here so people can know where is the problem and fix it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280883186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280887592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5038#issuecomment-280887592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5038","id":280887592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDg4NzU5Mg==","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-19T01:13:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T01:13:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Godricly  cudnn lstm ->\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/rnn/cudnn_lstm_bucketing.py","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280887592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280888866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5056#issuecomment-280888866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5056","id":280888866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDg4ODg2Ng==","user":{"login":"ijkguo","id":13162287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTYyMjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13162287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo","html_url":"https://github.com/ijkguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-19T01:39:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-19T01:44:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think v0.9.3 works, c.f. https://github.com/precedenceguo/mxnet/tree/expr .

I'm not at my development machine now, but these should roughly be the steps for installing mxnet with anaconda and GPU support:\r\n1. Install cuda 8 and cudnn 5.1\r\n2. Clone mxnet, set the gpu compilation flags in config.mk\r\n3. Install dependencies with `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libatlas-base-dev libopencv-dev graphviz`\r\n4. Build mxnet with `make -j$(nproc)`\r\n5. Install Anaconda. The installer with instructions can be found [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). The installer adds the anaconda location to your path. After running the installer and starting a new terminal (or sourcing `.bashrc`), `which python` should point to the anaconda executable. (At any point, you can uninstall anaconda by removing the anaconda directory and removing the line that adds anaconda to your path from your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bash_rc`-file.)\r\n6. Now you can choose to install mxnet in a fresh anaconda environment or your root anaconda environment.\r\n7. If you want a fresh environment, run something like `conda create --name mxnet numpy` to create a new mxnet-environment with numpy and activate the environment with `source activate mxnet`\r\n8. Now, if mxnet was successfully built, you should be able to run `python setup.py install` (without sudo) in mxnet's python directory. This should install mxnet for either the root anaconda environment  or the fresh mxnet environment, depending on whether you completed step 7. \r\n9. Finally, install opencv with `conda install -c menpo opencv=2.4.11`, and any other packages you may want. The anaconda root environment comes with quite a few scientific python packages. For a more compact option, there is also

So basically I took the example code from 0.8 (not that it should matter, but just to be consistent). Then it's important to set the buckets correctly to reproduce this. Basically I had:\r\n```\r\nbuckets = []\r\n```\r\nWhich leads the code to generate the buckets automatically and is equivalent to setting:\r\n```\r\nbuckets = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53,\r\n 55, 58, 63, 78, 82]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this I get:\r\n\r\n* v0.9 1840MB initially, 3744MiB after a while (then stops increasing)\r\n * v0.8 2310MiB initially, 2454MiB eventually, (then stops increasing)\r\n\r\nI think the growth of memory over time is a result of not seeing all bucket sizes initially. Once each bucket size has been observed the memory will not grow anymore (this behavior also has to do with the way memory sharing is implemented, which is relates this issue to issue https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/5035). I'm not entirely sure if this issue is exactly the same as https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/5035, with different behavior observed in 0.8 vs 0.9 due to the change in the [graphallocator](https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/blob/master/src/pass/plan_memory.cc) not having access to the data_pool_ in 0.9 anymore, or whether those are two separate issues. I kind of suspect the first and it might make sense to look at https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/5035 first.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope with this you will be able to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281143221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281143848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4580#issuecomment-281143848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4580","id":281143848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTE0Mzg0OA==","user":{"login":"morusu","id":15873594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODczNTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15873594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu","html_url":"https://github.com/morusu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morusu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-20T17:53:42Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T17:53:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"the same problem","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281143848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/281144095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5035#issuecomment-281144095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5035","id":281144095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTE0NDA5NQ==","user":{"login":"tdomhan","id":363737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzczNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/363737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan","html_url":"https://github.com/tdomhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdomhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-20T17:54:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T17:54:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here are the counts of different ndarray sizes in the default bucket's memory pool (for some arbitrary model and not the RNN example, but that shouldn't change the point):\r\n```\r\n        {0: 4,\r\n         256: 1,\r\n         512: 4,\r\n         1024: 2,\r\n         16.384: 836,\r\n         30.720: 121,\r\n         32.768: 542,\r\n         49.152: 59,\r\n         65.536: 179,\r\n         131.072: 59,\r\n         983040: 2,\r\n         1.966.080: 5,\r\n         30.842.880: 2}\r\n```\r\nvs the ones from a different bucket of smaller size.\r\n```\r\n       {0: 3,\r\n         256: 1,\r\n         512: 5,\r\n         10.240: 38,\r\n         16.384: 279,\r\n         32.768: 160,\r\n         49.152: 19,\r\n         65.536: 40,\r\n         131.072: 40,\r\n         327.680: 3,\r\n         655.360: 23,\r\n         10.280.960: 2}\r\n```\r\nThe meaning of the above number is e.g. that for the default bucket we got 1 ndarray of size 256 (bytes).

The problem with bucketing is that for each bucket, currently we first plan its memory unaware of the shared memory pool information. After the memory is planned, we try to reuse what's available in the shared memory pool. Because graph of big bucket and small bucket don't necessarily produce the same memory plan, it doesn't guarantee that no extra memory is allocated. I'm working on this to fix it.

as you pointed out, is it now possible to give grouped multi-loss to fit function?\r\nI am trying to do the following:\r\n```\r\nnet1 = softmax_out(scores_aux, multi_output=True) \r\nnet2 = softmax_out(scores, multi_output=True) \r\nnet = mx.sym.Group((net1, net2)) \r\nmod = mx.mod.Module(net, context=contexts) \r\n```\r\nAfter this when I call mod.fit, it gives me this error\r\n\r\n>

My  `dataiter.provide_data [('data', (4, 3, 504, 504))]` and `dataiter.provide_label [('softmax_aux_label', (4, 3969)), ('softmax_label', (4, 3969))]`\r\nI see <a href=\"http://mxnet.io/api/python/module.html#mxnet.module.module.Module\">here</a> how bind function has arguments `data_shapes and label_shapes` that can be used to identify label layers but there is nothing similar in fit function.\r\nAlso, when I try running the FeedForward function that is given as a solution here and in other issues, it gives me deprecation warning `DeprecationWarning: mxnet.model.FeedForward has been deprecated. Please use mxnet.mod.Module instead`\r\n\r\nIf fit does not support multi loss yet, what other alternatives do I have? \r\nI am fairly new to
