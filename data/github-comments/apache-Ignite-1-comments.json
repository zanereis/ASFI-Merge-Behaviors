The thing is, I am really unsure if this class is really a toy class not intended for any serious use or not. Personally I took the stance that this class might have been useful to get something up and running quickly, but it's probably not a good idea in a production environment. But of course, if you're a mysql user it's definitely not going to be quick, you're actually just going to be wasting your time.
