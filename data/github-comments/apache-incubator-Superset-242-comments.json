This is due to #7102, more precisely the style for the body element in ` superset/assets/stylesheets/less/index.less`.\r\n\r\nThe `position: absolute` setting on the `body` element causes Firefox to calculate the height (and consequently the `clientHeight`) of the `html` element as 0 as absolutely positioned elements have no influence on their parent's height. But NVD3 uses `document.documentElement.clientHeight` (`documentElement` is the `html` element) in the formula for calculating the position of the tooltip. Since it is always `0` on Firefox the calculation produces a grossly false result and places the tooltip off-screen.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the change from the pull request above is that is meant to ensure that the body will always cover the entire window.

So functionally this seems solid.\r\n- The `try`/`except` additions in `connectors/druid/models.py` still feel slightly messy, but I feel they should be acceptable given the tradeoff of being able to drop problematic licenses. This is also something I feel we can get improve later if needed. Here I think @mistercrunch @john-bodley @betodealmeida could weigh in with comments on whether or not the current solution is appropriate.\r\n- One bigger problem that still needs to be addressed is that the tests that require `pydruid` are now not run as part of CI. Ideally we would install `pydruid` and `requests` when running CI to make sure the Druid tests are run, but I'm unsure what Apache Legal thinks of this. @mistercrunch should we check with them if it's ok to use these deps in our CI setup? I can do the asking if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/516108906/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/516115170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7943#issuecomment-516115170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7943","id":516115170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjExNTE3MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T18:45:51Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T18:45:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7943](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/d37b7cdce871919d986b7b4b7b02c4e241257542?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7943      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   65.94%   65.97%   +0.02%     \n==========================================\n  Files         468      468              \n  Lines       22296    22296              \n  Branches     2429     2429              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        14704    14709       +5     \n+ Misses       7471     7466       -5     \n  Partials      121      121\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/postgres.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL3Bvc3RncmVzLnB5) | `95.45% <0%> (+22.72%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7943?src=pr&el=footer).

Also, I would suggest adding `pydruid` and `requests` from `requirements.txt` to `requirements-dev.txt`, as CI won't be able to run the tests for Druid otherwise. I'm sure it should be ok to keep the deps in the dev requirements, as installing those is optional (not pulled in by default), and hence should be ok with Apache policies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/516504485/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/516507972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7939#issuecomment-516507972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7939","id":516507972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjUwNzk3Mg==","user":{"login":"nabinkhadka","id":6050613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTA2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6050613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka","html_url":"https://github.com/nabinkhadka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabinkhadka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T17:05:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T17:05:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> you'll also want to add this to the tooltip on the non async query button too.\r\n> \r\n> Although I'd question if this is necessary since the keyboard shortcuts are already shown in the UI\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/62148482-a55e8700-b2ae-11e9-9fa9-025c7c1b77c3.png)\r\n\r\nAs a user, I like to know the shortcut when I hover it.
