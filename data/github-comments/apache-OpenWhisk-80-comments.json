Happy to share any details or collaborate if you need any assistance.  \r\n\r\nI believe your comment is referring to adding NumPy/Pandas to the list of packages which can be called without needing to create a Docker environment that includes the extra packages.  If so, then I wholeheartedly support this approach as it'd make OpenWhisk far more accessible to these very popular data science packages.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nJames Johnson\r\n(fellow IBMer posting

And it seems to have a problem with entities full qualified names like describe in the original comment on this Issue.\r\n```\r\n$ wsk action invoke /whisk.system/utils/echo -p hello windows\r\nerror: Unable to invoke action 'C:/Program Files/Git/whisk.system/utils/echo': The name of the entity contains illegal characters. (code 454638)\r\nRun 'wsk --help' for usage.\r\n```\r\nI tested multiple combinations of trying to make this shell happy to take the string as type but is getting converted.\r\nThe git-bash is based on mingw and according to this http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Posix_path_conversion I should be able to type `//whisk.system\\utils\\echo` with no success.\r\n\r\nYou should not use the wsk linux binaries from cmd.exe, powershell, or git-bash if you do you should see the following error\r\n```\r\n cannot execute binary file: Exec format error\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far of Bash on Ubuntu for Windows, I have not tried yet since my current Windows VM, is outdated, and out of space. So I will delegate to folks like @cfjedimaster to comment on how it get's setup and use.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/304961094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/304962857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2313#issuecomment-304962857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2313","id":304962857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDk2Mjg1Nw==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-30T18:14:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T18:14:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One idea to workaround the issue with mingw interpretation on windows with shells like git-bash is to add a paramter to compose full qualified names like with an extra parameter to compose the entity name with an extra flag to specify the namespace\r\n\r\n```\r\nwsk action invoke --namespace whisk.system utils/echo -p hello windows\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/304962857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/304963526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2313#issuecomment-304963526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2313","id":304963526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDk2MzUyNg==","user":{"login":"cfjedimaster","id":393660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzY2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster","html_url":"https://github.com/cfjedimaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfjedimaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-30T18:16:58Z","updated_at":"2017-05-30T18:16:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"wsk on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) works perfectly as far as I can tell.
