The issue happens when doing a table drop and CTAS. My understanding is that this would not happen when doing joins.\r\n\r\nI agree that we should find the root cause. I will work with Chun to add extra debugging to his repro to chase down how the information is leaking into the FileSystem configuration.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to keep the changes that enforce the immutability of DrillFileSystem. It would make things easier moving forward since a developer only has to remember two things about the DrillFileSystem. 1.) It's immutable. 2.) It's impossible for them to screw up the DrillFileSystem after it's created. Currently the DrillFileSystem's contract is ambiguous and unclear, and there are many accidental ways for a developer to corrupt the DrillFileSystem after it's created. I would rather make all of these things explicit and enforced.\r\n\r\nI'll update the PR with an RCA in a while.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393973462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393985480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1300#issuecomment-393985480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1300","id":393985480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk4NTQ4MA==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T19:27:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T19:27:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393985480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/393987570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/100#issuecomment-393987570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/100","id":393987570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk4NzU3MA==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T19:35:59Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T19:35:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sudipmukherjee It's been a while, but it would be really cool if we could get this in.

I consolidated the logic for checking if an exception is a Heap or Direct Memory OOM into FailureUtils, and I cleaned up catching those exceptions.\r\n- Added an UncaughtExceptionHandler to the main thread to display appropriate information and kill drill in the event of a CatastrophicError. Previously if the Drillbit main thread OOM'ed we would still run the shutdown hook and try to shutdown gracefully.\r\n - Added DrillThreadPoolExecutor to add support for handling uncaught exceptions, and terminating Drill in the case of Catastrophic Failure. Previously if we have a Heap OOM in one of our execution or scan threads we would continue running. This could lead to a hang, so we exit Drill now if this happens and bypass the shutdown hook.\r\n - Made all the thread pools handle uncaught exceptions.\r\n\r\n@dvjyothsna @vrozov @Ben-Zvi Please do another round of review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/395254205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/395257273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/639#issuecomment-395257273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/639","id":395257273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTI1NzI3Mw==","user":{"login":"ppadma","id":1904860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma","html_url":"https://github.com/ppadma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T00:43:12Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T00:43:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Even though it is old, this PR is still very much relevant and useful feature to have in Drill for certain use cases/scenarios. \r\nI request a committer to work with me so we can get it in.

offline with Vlad. We should not be overriding the thread pools to handle uncaught exceptions. This is because if we execute callables and get a future back the exceptions will automatically be thrown in the parent thread when future.get is called. However, in some places we are using custom runnable implementations like in the PartitionDecorator. In this case exceptions thrown in the thread pool are caught and set on the executor state, but are not handled by the parent thread.

I must say I'm a bit stumped. Value vectors are clearly not designed for concurrent modification. That is not simply a code bug, it is a fundamental design decision. Somewhere in code or documentation I recall a statement that says that value vectors are meant to be created once (by a single thread), then be immutable thereafter.\r\n\r\nIt should be perfectly fine for any number of readers, in separate threads, to access the vector once it has entered its immutable phase. But, nothing about vectors allows concurrent access while mutable.\r\n\r\nWhat is going on in this use case to cause concurrent modification. Is that a \"bug\" or a \"feature\"? In the stack trace you provided, both threads are creating a new vector, which should not cause a conflict. If, however, they are modifying the same record batch, then we are violating a design assumption that, like vectors, batches are immutable once created, and that each batch is mutated by a single thread.\r\n\r\nThe one other possibility is that a bit of code has a bug that is modifying the immutable schema when it should be modifying the mutable one (if working with two vectors), but I'm not sure how that could happen since code that adds fields is not aware of other vectors. Also, AFAIK, while I did change some code to keep metadata in sync (the design of `MaterializedField` really works only for simple vectors; it is a muddle for complex vectors such as maps), the changes only apply to the mutable stage of a vector's lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/396126712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
