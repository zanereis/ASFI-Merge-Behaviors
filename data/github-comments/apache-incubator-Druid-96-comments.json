I will try to replicate the problem with another datasource and provide you a sample later this week.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, I can give you a bit more information about the data. The schema of the dimension I am trying to ingest is the following:\n\n```\n\"type\":\"record\",\n\"name\":\"XXXX\",\n\"namespace\":\"XXXX\",\n\"fields\":[\n      ....\n      {\n         \"name\":\"session_status\",\n         \"type\":\n            {\n               \"type\":\"array\",\n               \"items\":\"string\"\n            },\n         \"doc\":\"Status of the session record\"\n      },\n      ...\n```\n\nI tried verifying I could indeed read the field properly from Scala. Using the following code works (rec: GenericRecord) for me:\n\n```\nrec.get(\"session_status\").asInstanceOf[GenericData.Array[String]].toList\n```\n\nAnd it returns me the correct values regardless of the number of entries in the array. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/230316861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/230361611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3213#issuecomment-230361611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3213","id":230361611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDM2MTYxMQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-04T22:54:34Z","updated_at":"2016-07-04T22:54:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You should try the Caravels issues list to get your question answered as\nnone of the committers are really familiar with operating Caravel.\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/caravel/issues\n\nOn Sun, Jul 3, 2016 at 8:35 PM, birdspring notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> When I followed the druid quickstart tutorial and loaded some data into\n> the wikiticker datasource.\n> I also queried druid and it certainly returned some data.\n> But as I added the cluster into Caravel and hit the \"refresh druid\n> metadata\" it only replied \"Please define at least one metric for your table\n> ‚Äú.\n> Any advice?

seems to be introducing a regression for fill capacity worker selection strategy. \nwith single assignment thread + fill capacity worker selection strategy, all the tasks get assigned to same worker until its capacity gets filled and only when a worker is filled to its capacity tasks are assigned to next worker. \n\nWith above patch, with multiple assignment threads and fill capacity worker select strategy, it is possible that each assignment thread will assign tasks to a separate worker even though none of them is filled to their capacity. \n\nThis may not affect most of the setups practically, but it theoretically alters the contract for worker selection strategy.
