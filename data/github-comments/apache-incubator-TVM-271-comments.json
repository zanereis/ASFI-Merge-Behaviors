If TVM is able to consume everything represented in the flat buffer, it doesn’t matter what APIs created that as it is the ultimate of what can be represented by the higher level APIs. That produces an argument that this kind of approach can be used to reason about coverage of Tensorflow Lite operators at the flatbuffer level i.e. if TVM is able to consume and test the 150 operators that are representable in the schema, then the frontend is pretty robust in what it can consume. \r\n\r\n- The point about semantic changes between versions is possibly a valid one - but I would personally expect that Tensorflow lite did not break backwards compatibility (modulo actual bug fixes and fixing correctness issues with existing operators) for a standard Operator (i.e. not in the custom op space) in the way described in the example with the custom operator as that would need consumers needing updates in their tflite readers and runtimes / deployment scenarios that are independent of each other.\r\n\r\n- Finally the notion that this somehow makes life harder for TVM developers is debatable as far as I am concerned.  I expect the complexity of understanding the semantics of the operator have changed in the implementation in the Tensor-flow lite framework to be same in both approaches. I think is easier to explore with a frozen flat buffer between 2 versions rather than having to dig in to the TF and keras API and understand the vagaries of that with differences in versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\nRamana","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/876714877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/876780785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8421#issuecomment-876780785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8421","id":876780785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Njc4MDc4NQ==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-08T22:16:47Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T22:16:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CC @tkonolige @comaniac","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/876780785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/876781779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8419#issuecomment-876781779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8419","id":876781779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3Njc4MTc3OQ==","user":{"login":"u99127","id":19559067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU5MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19559067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127","html_url":"https://github.com/u99127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-08T22:19:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T22:19:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do we not need a new test for this ?

I found the Pytorch implementation https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py#L1624 cannot handle dynamic shapes. So I added this optimization based on the ONNX implementation. For some reason, the weight matrix of nn.dense must be static for the tvm codegen to work correctly, though using libs like mkl works just fine.

This is Ruihao. Recently I'm working on moving Apache TVM into SGX environment by using Rust SGX SDK. However, by looking at commit histories, I find that you decided to switch Rust SGX SDK to Fortanix SGX EDP after this commit. I was trying to build the Rust SGX SDK version of TVM from commits before that commit but I was getting build errors. May I ask if there is a working version based on Rust SGX SDK? If so, I could continue working on it and patch it to the newest Rust SGX SDK version.

What do you think about it?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/878266242/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/878353106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8432#issuecomment-878353106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8432","id":878353106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODM1MzEwNg==","user":{"login":"Johnson9009","id":19802523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODAyNTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19802523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009","html_url":"https://github.com/Johnson9009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-12T15:02:54Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T15:02:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After one day debugging, I find the root cause of this issue, it is the below \"if\" statement.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1d7a9e9dff1983cd4b12104f93b32bfe4b4c4f7e/src/relay/transforms/type_infer.cc#L557-L559\r\nWith the help of git history, it is added by the PR #2437.\r\n\r\nJust use the above test case to describe why the issue will happen, before the 1st invocation of \"InferType\" pass, the types of function are something like below.\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%x1: Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 3), int8], %x2: Tensor[(7, 7, 3, 64), int8]) -> IncompleteTypeNode(0, 0xYYYYYY) {\r\n  %0 = nn.pad(%x1, 0 /* ty=int32 */, pad_width=[[0, 0], [3, 3], [3, 3], [0, 0]]) /* ty=IncompleteTypeNode(0, 0xYYYYYY) */;\r\n  nn.conv2d(%0, %x2, padding=[0, 0, 0, 0], data_layout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWIO\", out_dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=IncompleteTypeNode(0, 0xYYYYYY) */\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe return type of the function is not defined, so `f->ret_type.defined()` will be evaluated to \"false\", so everything is good, after the 1st invocation of \"InferType\" pass, the types of function are something like below.\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%x1: Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 3), int8], %x2: Tensor[(7, 7, 3, 64), int8]) -> Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), int32] {\r\n  %0 = nn.pad(%x1, 0 /* ty=int32 */, pad_width=[[0, 0], [3, 3], [3, 3], [0, 0]]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 230, 230, 3), int8] */;\r\n  nn.conv2d(%0, %x2, padding=[0, 0, 0, 0], data_layout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWIO\", out_dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), int32] */\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter my pass \"SimplifyPad\", the \"nn.pad\" operator is removed, and then the 2nd invocation of pass \"InferType\" will happen, the types of function at this time are something like below.\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%x1: Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 3), int8], %x2: Tensor[(7, 7, 3, 64), int8]) -> Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), int32] {\r\n  nn.conv2d(%x1, %x2, padding=[0, 0, 0, 0], data_layout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWIO\", out_dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=IncompleteTypeNode(0, 0xYYYYYY) */\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe key difference at this time is the return type of the function, it is defined and is \"Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), int32]\", because the last expression of this function is \"nn.conv2d\", so the return type of \"nn.conv2d\" is the return type of the function.
