It's slowly coming back.  The `StreamReader`seeks until it finds the identifier, then flushes the `StringBuilder` and appends characters until the final end brace is met, accounting for any nested begin brace/end brace combinations.  The big problem that happens is if the identifier is embedded as a string inside a JSON record, it would create an incomplete record.  If your identifier was `record` in the below example where the split is the horizontal line, bad stuff would happen.

patch.\n\n+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/178322612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/178322710","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/313#issuecomment-178322710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/313","id":178322710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODMyMjcxMA==","user":{"login":"wangzw","id":1254826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1254826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw","html_url":"https://github.com/wangzw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangzw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T02:37:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T02:37:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks

@adamjshook  \nAs an experiment i've rempimplemented/replaced the `JsonRecordReader`&`JsonStreamReader` with ideas and code boroed from the [json-mapreduce](https://github.com/alexholmes/json-mapreduce) project.  I really like the result. It comes with a (sort of) JsonLexer/Parser that solves some of the shortcomings in the current implementation. For example having the `identifier` in the nested object(s) values will be handled. \nFurthermore the `identifier` is used to refers to a member name which it will use to determine the encapsulating object to return. This is superior functionality to  what we have at the moment as you can point to multi-line json object that doesn't have a parent identifier name. \n\nShall i add this change to this PR or to a separate one after this is merged? \nPersonally i think it is better to add it now as it changes the `identifier` semantics and would be inconvenient for the potential users to learn/unlearn. Alternatively we can drop the current JsonRecordReader form this PR and introduce the new code as an extension i another one. What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/178608613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/178615116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/302#issuecomment-178615116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/302","id":178615116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODYxNTExNg==","user":{"login":"adamjshook","id":1372828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook","html_url":"https://github.com/adamjshook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T14:55:55Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T14:55:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tzolov A quick review of the json-mapreduce project looks good to me.

about this specific case: do we plan an upgrade path from HAWQ 1.x to 2.0? If no, then this PR can be easily merged into 2.0. If yes, we should really care about the upgrade path, and maybe the better solution here would be the following: instead of changing existing data type introduce new one, like \"money8\" for 8-byte money data type. This would again be a catalog change (for example, in pg_type), but still won't affect the customers using old data type \"money\" and layout of their existing tables\n\nGenerally speaking, I agree that this is a tough question. Postgres is not a very good example here - you can easily do pg_dump and pg_restore there as the data volumes it operates with are usually quite small. As of HAWQ, making dump and restore to accommodate storage format change can't be an option as we might have hundreds of TB there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/179084818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/179140402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/330#issuecomment-179140402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/330","id":179140402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTE0MDQwMg==","user":{"login":"liming01","id":1654299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTQyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1654299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01","html_url":"https://github.com/liming01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liming01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T10:05:01Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T10:05:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me. +1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/179140402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/179344304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/302#issuecomment-179344304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/302","id":179344304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTM0NDMwNA==","user":{"login":"tzolov","id":1351573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1351573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov","html_url":"https://github.com/tzolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T16:57:03Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T16:57:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In the last commit(s): \n- Added tests to cover corner cases like malformed json records or compressed input files.
