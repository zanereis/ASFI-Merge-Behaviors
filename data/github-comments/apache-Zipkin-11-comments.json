Why doesn't latency scale linearly with the number of items we're fetching?\n> B. What are the main use-cases of zipkin, and which of them should we optimize for?\n> C. How much do zipkin users care about latency? What is acceptable?\n\nI think these are great questions to ask and discuss in terms of overall direction for Zipkin, but I do not see them as show-stopper questions for merging a very minor pull request. From the outside-looking-in on a number of projects, it's always encouraging to see my pull requests merged, even if they do spawn subsequent work (like that captured in this ticket). IMO this is important to foster a good community of contributors.\n\nI think this issue is a good example of how to handle things like this. It was a clearly minor change but as has been raised, defaults are important (of course, until this issue is resolved it's not a default so much as a _constant_). That's not something a casual contributor should be deadlocked in, otherwise the project likely will lose them forever.\n\nPersonally, I think the best way to answer those questions (A, B, C) is to get releases built and start getting feedback from other users which have not traditionally participated in the project\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/122106422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/122116992","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/462#issuecomment-122116992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/462","id":122116992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjExNjk5Mg==","user":{"login":"mosesn","id":156562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjU2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn","html_url":"https://github.com/mosesn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosesn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-16T22:03:48Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T22:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adriancole and I resolved our disagreement off-list, and we agreed that my questions on that PR were out of scope for the change.\n\n@rtyler I agree that we should be working to make sure contributors feel welcome, and that being able to merge a PR quickly is a great way to get a contributor excited about the project.

When I initially started integrating Zipkin we were actually using logstash but logstash had no codec support at that time. This is supported as of [version 1.2.0](https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-658).
