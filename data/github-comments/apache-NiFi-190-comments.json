Based on that description, are you saying that there is a reason to keep some JSON values as escaped strings? That seems counter-intuitive in general, although every flow is different. The JSON output of AttributesToJSON can be modified using other Processors like JoltTransformJSON. Does translating all JSON attribute values into objects create processing problems in the use case mentioned?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1551830406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1551894936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7231#issuecomment-1551894936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7231","id":1551894936,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5cgAmY","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T18:49:59Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T18:49:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I agree with you that is counter intuitive so much so my first iteration of this PR actually always converted to JSON.

Other reviewers are probably in a better position to evaluate some of the functionality, but I provided a few comments on style and functionality.\r\n> \r\n> At a high-level, on particular question concerns the use of JSON as the output format, and one message per FlowFile. For high-volume processing, the ability to combine multiple records in a single FlowFile allows for much higher throughput. As mentioned in the detailed comments, adding support for a RecordWriter service would also make the output much more flexible, supporting JSON as well as other types.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I agree with this. After testing this for some time, enhancements can definitely be made to improve the performance and scalability of this processor. The current one-record-per-FlowFile approach is very slow for bulk operations; say delete/update say 100K+ records. Some sort of batching strategy here could be particularly useful for high-volume database operations, helping to maximize throughput and address potential performance issues as @exceptionfactory has mentioned.
