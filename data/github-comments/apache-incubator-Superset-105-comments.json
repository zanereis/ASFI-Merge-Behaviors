up on this issue, I have tried to create the button 'export as svg' to the component Controls.jsx in:\r\nsuperset/static/assets/javascripts/dashboard/components/\r\n\r\nHere is the Button that i added in the ButtonGroup:\r\n \r\n```\r\n       <Button\r\n            onClick={() => my-svg-crowbar()}\r\n        >\r\n            <i className=\"fa fa-download\" />\r\n        </Button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Function **my-svg-crowbar** is exported from the svg-crowbar.js script from NYTimes github page.\r\nIt's the same code, but it returns 1 in the last line so that i'm sure that it doesnt return null when i pass it to the arrow function, don't know if it matters\r\n\r\nI expected there to be 1 more button in the dashboard screen, on the right, next to the save, message, edit, refresh ... buttons \r\n\r\nCould just tell me what i have to add to complete the code ? \r\n\r\nI really need your help, thanks for your

more context on what I've found out. \r\nOracle DBs / SQLAlch will return a lower case column EXCEPT if the column has mixed case. \r\n\r\nunder the hood Superset renames the \"min\" , \"max\",

about is all the calculated metrics could also be in all caps.\r\n\r\nFor example, `min(x) as MIN__X` and then we could have `.upper()` to make sure everything is upper. \r\n\r\nRight now, we'll need to apply something to make sure these calc'd metrics aren't made upper and that any future metrics don't become upper, but yet we also catch the names of any other columns from the

Give me a few days to fully respond because I have a major deadline this week at my job. I'd be down to try to wrap up the backend work.\r\n\r\nI think when I initially tried this I had trouble getting the SVGs to render properly. So I think like half of visualizations render fully but some of the visualizations render only partially. That, plus I had trouble testing this with the mailer function that's in the codebase but I assume that function is working fine. I think if I can figure out why not all the SVGs from the example visualizations are rendering properly it won't be too hard to finish up the rest of the backend work so you can make a button and export the SVGs : )\r\n\r\nKeep in mind my original commit didn't go into master and its not 100% done so if you're spending time finishing it, try pausing on it until the end of the weekend.
