The `Task` class filters out exceptions that come after the transition to the \"canceling\" state. Don't try to be super smart there, propagate your exceptions, and the context will decide whether they should be logged.\n- The RabbitMQ source is not doing any proper failure handling (critical!). I opened a separate JIRA issue for that.\n- Just commenting out the twitter sources is bad style, in my opinion. There is actually no chance of getting this pull request in, and this one here is a release blocker, while the Twitter Source one is not a release blocker.\n- All functions set their `running` flag to true at the beginning of the `run()` method. In the case of races between invoking and canceling the source, it can mean that the flag is set to false in the cancel() method and then to true in the run() method, resulting in a non-canceled source. I fixed some cases in my follow up pull-request, but many are still in. Please make another careful pass with respect to that.\n- In general, the streaming sources are extremely badly commented.

The twitter stuff I just commented out because I assumed that the new TwitterSource could be merged right away and I was waiting for that.\n\nAs for two Source interfaces. We can certainly do that. The reason I didn't do it is because there would be a lot of duplication because we have SourceFunction, ParallelSourceFunction, RichSourceFunction and ParallelRichSourceFunction. With the new Source interface this would go up to 8 interfaces for the sources. (That's also the reason why I didn't have Kafka derived from the RichParallelSourceFunction, I thought that maybe we could get rid of the special interfaces for parallel sources.)\n\nAlso, I realize there are many more problems. I just can't address them all in a single PR. :sweat_smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/107811407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/107831123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/700#issuecomment-107831123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/700","id":107831123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNzgzMTEyMw==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-02T06:54:31Z","updated_at":"2015-06-02T06:54:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey guys.

thinking about the signal name again, I disagree. \"terminate\" does not mean kill, but is a request to gracefully shut down. \"stop\" from my point of view is too soft, as it does not indicates strongly enough, that the job is completely shut down and \"cleared\". I would interpret \"stop\" more as an interrupt signal (with an according \"re-start\" signal, that wakes up the job again).\n\nAny other opinions?

Let's write a blog post about this very soon. :-) As soon as I have access to more machines, I will test it on a cluster. The stuff denoted with [RB] should be fixed in any case before merging imo. The rest we can also do afterwards.\n\n**USER FACING**\n1. Disable the analysis by default. [RB]\n2. This is cumbersome, but we should go for Annotation-based exclusions instead of package based (see inline comments). [RB]\n3. Currently manual annotations trump automatic ones, which is a good thing, because people won't have unexpected results. Could you add a test for this?\n4. I would give the analyzer util the call location based function name (String callLocation = Utils.getCallLocationName()). I think that will have better output than just `Function 'Job$2' has been analyzed with the following result: ...`\n5. I would rename `UdfAnalyisMode` (see inline comments).\n6. The hints are currently logged on a singe line w/o a whitespace after each hint, like this:\n   \n   ```\n   Function modifies static fields. This can lead to unexpected behaviour during runtime.Function returns 'null' values. This can lead to errors during runtime.A need for forwarded fields annotations could not be found.\n   ```\n7. Some analysis like a wrong tuple index access or returning null lead fail the program before submitting it, which is very nice. I would actually like to log these problems on a log level WARN (instead of INFO) when only hints are enabled.\n8. When you have optimize enabled and run a filter, which changes the input, the error you get is this. You can't tell what's wrong.\n   \n   ```\n   Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.flink.api.java.sca.UdfErrorException: UDF contains obvious errors.\n   at org.apache.flink.api.java.sca.UdfAnalyzer.analyze(UdfAnalyzer.java:300)\n   ...\n   ```\n   \n   For a wrong tuple index access, it is correct:\n   \n   ```\n   Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.flink.api.java.sca.UdfErrorException: UDF contains obvious errors.\n   at org.apache.flink.api.java.sca.UdfAnalyzer.analyze(UdfAnalyzer.java:300)\n   ...\n   Caused by: org.apache.flink.api.java.sca.UdfErrorException: Function contains tuple accesses with invalid indexes. This can lead to errors during runtime.\n   at org.apache.flink.api.java.sca.UdfAnalyzer.addHintOrThrowException(UdfAnalyzer.java:413)\n   ...\n   ```\n   \n   I'm not sure if the thrown Execption should be an `UdfErrorException` or an `UdfAnalysisException`?\n9. When optimizing is enabled, I would still print the inferred forwarded fields.\n10. Regarding the result messages: personally, I think the hints/messages could be more consise, e.g. for example skip the `(should be kept to a minimum)` in the number of object creations msg or just say `Forwarded fields: none` instead of `A need for forwarded fields annotations could not be found.`\n\n**INTERNALS**\n1. I think the internals could use more comments. It's easy to get the general idea, but it would be nice to also get some high-level comments about the ASM-related stuff. I didn't have time to dig deep into it.\n\n---\n\nWill report back after cluster tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/107996871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/108002285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/759#issuecomment-108002285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/759","id":108002285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODAwMjI4NQ==","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-02T16:08:10Z","updated_at":"2015-06-02T16:08:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix, LGTM.

What I propose is to have this run method:\n\n```\nvoid run(SourceContext context);\n```\n\nThen the source context would have methods to retrieve the locking object (for checkpointed sources) and for emitting elements. Part of my motivation for this is that this can be extended in the future without breaking existing sources. If we introduce proper timestamps at some point we can extend the SourceContext with a method for emitting elements with a timestamp. Then, if we want to have watermarks the context can have methods for activating automatically generated watermarks and for emitting watermarks.

@mfahimazizi, \n\nThe common practice is to prefix the commit with the Jira issue, e.g. [FLINK-20XX][gelly]. Also, you should play with your IDE's settings. Right now, indentation is performed with spaces and it should be with tabs. This is why Travis is failing. To make sure the code works do a cd flink-staging/flink-gelly and then mvn verify. A success there equals a travis success 98% of the time :)\n\nAfter implementing an algorithm, it's always good to check whether it works correctly by writing a test (check the test/example/ folder :) ). \nI would also update the documentation here. In the Library method section add an entry \"*HITS\", perhaps with the full name of the acronym as well. \n\nI left some comments in-line.
