@Tigwin for the context!\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are talking about an option to go from this:\r\n* zipkin-span-2024-01-26 (as spans are collected)\r\n* zipkin-dependency-2024-01-26 (via zipkin-dependencies)\r\n\r\nTo just a global index like this:\r\n* zipkin-span\r\n* zipkin-dependency\r\n\r\nTo recap from chat, the main reasons we have daily index patterns is to:\r\n* prevent scanning an indefinite amount of documents by default (query and aggregation performance degradation)\r\n* to help the dependency job from having to aggregate all data\r\n* help folks curate their data which usually is 3-7 days expiration\r\n\r\nTechnically, I think the work is likely not too bad vs trying to support arbitrary patterns, but users would need to accept the risk that if they don't expire data, routine queries for recent traces may become unusable and the dependencies job may take forever or a cluster to complete. It might help to suggest how you plan to expire data, in order to help others.\r\n\r\nImplementation would require changes here and also in the zipkin-dependencies repo to make sure it works as there are assumptions about index patterns I think.\r\n\r\nIn Zipkin, we usually follow a \"rule of three\" where we block on three sites interest for tricky features. Ping back when there are at least three (👍 ) on this and no other contributors saying \"please don't\". You can self-thumbs up for simpler counting ;)\r\n\r\nFWIW, I'm ok with this, but do think we need the feature to have more popularity prior to starting the work.\r\n\r\ncc @openzipkin/elasticsearch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1911133545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1911144052","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3711#issuecomment-1911144052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3711","id":1911144052,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5x6b50","user":{"login":"xeraa","id":432211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjIxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/432211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa","html_url":"https://github.com/xeraa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xeraa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-25T23:12:16Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T23:12:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"How do you expire data? `_delete_by_query`?

@SamTV12345 In case you are interested in a varied experience our JS/TS tracing library is in dire need of help.

If you have some time to polish it up, I'm sure you'll make a lot of friends https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-js/issues/536\n\nThanks for the invite. Sure I'll take a look at the JavaScript repository. Maybe I can polish this up. I've been maintaining Etherpad for 1 1/2 years so shouldn't be a problem to find my way through the code :).
