For e.g. there are many aggregation functions which will work when the forward index is disabled (min, max, some of the distinct count functions) and some which won't (sum, average, etc). We agreed that it's an acceptable tradeoff to fail early during server side planning for most cases by adding the forward index null checks instead. Few failure scenarios also depend on the existence of other indexes and we'd have to identify such scenarios during execution anyways as once again adding any kind of static checks on broker side will get messy and error prone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1267946281/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1268023164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9536#issuecomment-1268023164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9536","id":1268023164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5LlH98","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-05T06:52:58Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T07:20:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9536?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9536](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9536?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (da76da3) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/5ca72a377d98b5b4e98141ed1c2c14f8bc6e9961?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (5ca72a3) will **increase** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #9536      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     69.88%   69.91%   +0.02%     \n- Complexity     4871     4875       +4     \n============================================\n  Files          1927     1927              \n  Lines        102694   102691       -3     \n  Branches      15586    15586              \n============================================\n+ Hits          71771    71798      +27     \n+ Misses        25858    25832      -26     \n+ Partials       5065     5061       -4     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `25.95% <100.00%> (-0.02%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `24.68% <100.00%> (+0.14%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `67.27% <ø> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `15.58% <100.00%> (+0.03%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

In case of excessive errors from Pinot triggering the alarms, or a client team asking why some of their requests were failing, we don't have an effective way to correlate client and Pinot logs, and to definitively conclude what went wrong for a particular request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1270773878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1270880821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9545#issuecomment-1270880821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9545","id":1270880821,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5LwBo1","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T00:25:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T00:25:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe the brokerId is also logged in the server log for a successful query.\r\n\r\nWe may need to make sure that these are also logged whenever an error/warning pertaining to a query is logged.\r\n\r\nIn case of clients, the clients only need to log information about queries that don't work as expected, right?

However, the same brokerId doesn't seem being used for logging within the broker, and broken doesn't seem to even make an info/summary log in normal case, assuming this is [the end of request cycle](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/BaseBrokerRequestHandler.java#L712-L716).\r\n\r\nWhile it may be possible to make log tradable among components with the (requestId, brokerId) combo, with substantial work it seems, it's still an inefficient and much less convenient approach compared to if we can make them traceable with just a single requestId, if we can just make this requestId globally unique, either as an UUID, or like the [globalQueryId](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/0fa93971875fadbca17e5577fc45a9434d395329/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/BaseBrokerRequestHandler.java#L1649) you're already making here: `_brokerId + \"_\" + requestId`\r\n\r\nBy skimming through the 2 classes I linked above, I found the general pattern of logging is like `LOGGER.error(\"Some message, requestId={}\", requestId)`, which in my opinion is very tedious, inconsistent, and unreliable, that not every log is following the pattern and those untagged logs becomes practically unsearchable in a high traffic production environment.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest a more reliable approach of adding a request filter/valve in front of the handler, to put requestId into Log4j's threadContext, like this\r\n```\r\nbeforeHandler(Request req) {\r\n  val requestId = Optional.of(req.getHeader(\"x-pinot-requestId\")).getOrElse(UUID.newId());\r\n  MDC.put(\"requestId\", requestId);\r\n}\r\n\r\nafterHandler(Response resp) {\r\n   val requestId = MDC.remove(\"requestId\");\r\n   resp.setHeader(\"x-pinot-requestId\", requestId);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlong with proper config in log4j2.xml like\r\n```\r\n<PatternLayout pattern=\"%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} {requestId} %p [%c{1}] [%t] %m%n\"/>\r\n```\r\nThen all logs made with something like `LOGGER.error(\"Some message\")` will automatically look like this in logs\r\n```\r\n[DateTime] REQUEST_ID processId ... Some message.\r\n```\r\nThis will automatically cover all log messages made within a request cycle and make them easily searchable.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it's already doing something similar [here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/0fa93971875fadbca17e5577fc45a9434d395329/pinot-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/broker/requesthandler/BaseBrokerRequestHandler.java#L263-L265) with the requestContext, we just need to extend this to log context as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1271224575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1271355633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9544#issuecomment-1271355633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9544","id":1271355633,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Lx1jx","user":{"login":"navina","id":1909480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDk0ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1909480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina","html_url":"https://github.com/navina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T09:34:37Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T09:46:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvivekiyer I had intentionally tried to stay away from using `Generics` in this new interface as it make the code hard to maintain.

Keeping StreamMessage generic will avoid unnecessary type conversion (which could involve serializing and deserializing) for such users. \r\n\r\nI am curious why Linkedin does this? isn't is expensive to deserialize every record until when the deserialized payload is actually needed? The consumer's contract should not involve deserializing the payload. Can you please explain why this is useful? \r\nI also don't understand the point about \"unnecessary type conversion\" here. Can you please elaborate?\r\n\r\nUsing generics forces the segment manager implementation to deal with raw usage of parameterized classes (due to type erasures) and make the code hard to read and maintain. \r\nBesides,`StreamMessage` is meant to abstract the entire incoming payload. Using only the type of the record's \"value\" in this generic class seems prohibitive. \r\n\r\nSoliciting feedback from @npawar / @Jackie-Jiang / @kishoreg here. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also fixed a NPE in StreamDataDecoderImpl.java where metadata header is null.\r\n\r\nThank you for fixing this!
