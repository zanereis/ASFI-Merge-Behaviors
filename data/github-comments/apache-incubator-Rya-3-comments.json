Andrew,\n\nI think what happened is this:\n\n\n   - I forked your repo.\n   -  A little while after, but before branching for my actual change, I\n   attempted to sync my fork following the instructions here:\n   https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/. I pushed the changes\n   to my github fork after the merge - this appears to have assigned all new\n   commit ids for each of the commits that were merged from your upstream repo\n   during the sync to my local copy of my fork.\n   - I created my branch and made the single commit I wanted to have pulled.\n   - I created the pull request not realizing that I had actually created\n   all of those additional, redundant, commits during the sync. It is these\n   commits that I could not figure out how to get rid of.\n\nIt looks like my pull request was accepted and I hope that I have not\nmessed anything up in the process :-(\n\nI think I need to find a better way to keep my fork up to date with the\nupstream version such that I don't have re-commits of all the commits that\nwere made on your fork. Any suggestions you have would be appreciated.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nLynne Lawrence\n\n\nOn Tue, Jan 3, 2017 at 2:25 PM, Andrew Smith <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> if you need help, let me know\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/apache/incubator-rya/pull/133#issuecomment-270200225>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACa8iUOpYDH1ExDLris_u7CigPBcc96fks5rOqCSgaJpZM4LUXhB>\n> .\n>\n\n\n\n-- \nLynne Lawrence\nMACE | SNC\nlynne.lawrence@macefusion.com\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/270216402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/270218318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rya/pull/130#issuecomment-270218318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/130","id":270218318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDIxODMxOA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T20:39:15Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T20:39:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/incubator-rya-master-with-optionals-pull-requests-on-demand/24/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/270218318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/270277648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rya/pull/133#issuecomment-270277648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/133","id":270277648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDI3NzY0OA==","user":{"login":"isper3at","id":12698945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk4OTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12698945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at","html_url":"https://github.com/isper3at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isper3at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T02:02:19Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T02:02:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I rarely(reads: never) keep my master up to date.
