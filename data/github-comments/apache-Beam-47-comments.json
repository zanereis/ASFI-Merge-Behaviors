So, the value of [`test_with_requirements_file`](https://github.com/swegner/incubator-beam/blob/9ec4c926f0038f974e79afe0e65e200ef2a23c3e/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/dependency_test.py#L113) is only that it validates the behavior when the default cache location is used. Seems only marginally valuable to me, so I'd be fine dropping the test.\n\n> More importantly, if this is used as a cache, it should be safe to re-use or there's a bug here, right?\n\nThis may point to an issue in [`dependency.stage_job_resources`](https://github.com/swegner/incubator-beam/blob/9ec4c926f0038f974e79afe0e65e200ef2a23c3e/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/dependency.py#L208). It internally calls [`populate_requirements_cache`](https://github.com/swegner/incubator-beam/blob/9ec4c926f0038f974e79afe0e65e200ef2a23c3e/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/dependency.py#L194) which is strictly additive-- it uses `pip` to download requested dependencies into the cache, but doesn't clear non-requested ones. It then gathers a list of all resources using [a file glob of the cache directory](https://github.com/swegner/incubator-beam/blob/9ec4c926f0038f974e79afe0e65e200ef2a23c3e/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/dependency.py#L270). As a result, the final list of resources may contain previously cached resources.\n\nIt seems we are using the cache directory as a sandbox area to resolve transitive dependencies needed to stage.

worry about this. The fact that this is necessary means that there are cases where the ClassLoader that pulled in DoFnInvokers differs from the ClassLoader of the thread running user code. Is this only happening in specific runners? It would be good to understand the cases this can happen.\n\nThe larger potential problem is that we cache the loaded class. So, with just this change, we're now assuming that whichever ClassLoader was associated with the thread the first time we created a DoFnInvoker will always be the ClassLoader associated with all future threads that create DoFnInvokers.\n\nGiven that the first assumption (they're the same) is being violated, how do we know the second is a valid assumption? If we need to go down this route (and we should understand the runner environment leading to it), we may need to have a per-ClassLoader cache of the DoFnInvoker classes, allowing us to load it into each ClassLoader we need it in.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/249943394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/249944235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1013#issuecomment-249944235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1013","id":249944235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTk0NDIzNQ==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T17:54:03Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T17:54:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kennknowles That's the way I do it, and I don't believe that there's another way -
