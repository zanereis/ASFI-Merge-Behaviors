I though it was resolved. \r\nIn general, there's no `fancy` stuff you need to do to install on windows. We have pre-complied and packed to pip wheel so everyone should be able to install it using `pip install mxnet`. \r\nThe windows version was available since 0.11 several months ago, and it is considerably stable because we do have a forum that have users reporting the installation on windows version. Recently it goes alright with very little complaining about installation problems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, windows may sometimes missing some fundamental dependencies, such as visual c++ runtime, or CUDA runtime which must be installed separately by users, not to mention its complicated \r\nPATH management, making it hard to diagnose without experience. \r\n\r\nIf you still have problems using mxnet-cu80, you can first try uninstall it, then `pip install mxnet` and try it to see if the CPU version works. If not, try install visual c++ 2015 redistributed package to enable c++ runtime on windows. If CPU version is good, then there must be some problem with the CUDA installation. You can test with CUDA samples provided by nvidia, or check the PATH again, mxnet do search for PATH so if should be fine just add them to PATH.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355658888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355666849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9294#issuecomment-355666849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9294","id":355666849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTY2Njg0OQ==","user":{"login":"gamenn","id":35082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn","html_url":"https://github.com/gamenn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T21:13:05Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T21:13:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhreshold Yes, when I did \"pip install mxnet\", the CPU version was indeed working.
