Zipkin is already on Spring 4.3.x, and thus, we could just put the annotation on the `ZipkinQueryApiV1` controller with some property like `zipkin.query.cors-origins` to configure the origins, with a default of `*` in `zipkin-server.yml`. This way people can customize it.\n\nIt feels a little weird to me to be able to configure the allowed CORS origins for any path on the Zipkin server via properties, as the implementation at the time of this comment allows.

clarify things..\n\nWe have an index for the zipkin span json, called `zipkin-2016-08-14`. Span documents have a nullable timestamp field, but it is in epoch microseconds, not milliseconds. Basically, it is stored as a long.\nEx. \n\n``` json\n{\n  \"traceId\": \"3b47c02255029f91\",\n  \"name\": \"client-calls-server-via-post\",\n  \"id\": \"3b47c02255029f91\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1455242412402125,\n  \"duration\": 9441,\n  \"annotations\": [],\n  \"binaryAnnotations\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"jaegerClient\",\n      \"value\": \"Python-0.7.9\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"lc\",\n      \"value\": \"client\",\n      \"endpoint\": {\n        \"serviceName\": \"client\",\n        \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWe want to index on span.timestamp/1000, via a date attribute or otherwise that Kibana can read, but that isn't stored back into the original document json (ideally). In the above example, where .timestamp=1455242412402125 (epoch micros), the one for kibana would be 1455242412402 (epoch millis).\n\nHere's our [index template](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-storage/elasticsearch/src/main/resources/zipkin/storage/elasticsearch/zipkin_template.json). Can someone help us figure out what to do?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/239649853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/239660765","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1236#issuecomment-239660765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1236","id":239660765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTY2MDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-14T07:48:46Z","updated_at":"2016-08-14T07:48:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Motivation for this is to lower barrier for tracers to include zipkin's standard library without resorting to extracting a separate \"model jar\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/239660765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/239693062","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1209#issuecomment-239693062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1209","id":239693062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTY5MzA2Mg==","user":{"login":"lukeotterblad","id":9137725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzc3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9137725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad","html_url":"https://github.com/lukeotterblad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukeotterblad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-14T19:52:25Z","updated_at":"2016-08-14T19:52:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You're basically stuck making another field as you can either use their defined formats (of which epoch_millis is one) or define a custom format, which you can do via ...\n\nhttp://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html\n\nBut this effectively uses code similar to below (this example is in groovy):\n\n```\n@Grab( 'joda-time:joda-time:2.1' )\nimport org.joda.time.*\nimport org.joda.time.format.*\n\nString a = \"1455242412402125\"\n\nDateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormat.forPattern( \"<insert-your-pattern-here>\" ); //<-- There's no pattern you can define to parse the microsecond representation as a string\n\ndef timestamp = dtf.parseDateTime( a )\n\nprintln timestamp \n```\n\nYou also cant add any kind of processing layer on the timestamp field (similar to an analyzer for text) such that you could have elasticsearch process your times (prior to indexing) to millis as analyzers are only for string fields.
