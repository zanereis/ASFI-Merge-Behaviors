I haven't been able to get the script to run in R Studio yet because it can't find the cudart.so library. I suppose I will need to figure out why IPython can find the library, but R Studio cannot, so that I can switch to running mxnet in R Studio.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/171821388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/171822734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1210#issuecomment-171822734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1210","id":171822734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTgyMjczNA==","user":{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-15T00:05:11Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T00:05:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I guess you must be using the GPU.\n\nThe simplest solution: startup RStudio from terminal.\n\nOn Linux, just `rstudio`;

closing this issue. I couldn't figure out the data iterator but I wrote an EvalMetric to calculate the F1-Score in case people are looking for it in the future. It is hard coded to a specific class label though.\n\n```\n# coding: utf-8\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\nfrom mxnet import metric\n\"\"\"Online evaluation metric module.\"\"\"\n\n# from .base import string_types\nimport numpy\n\nclass F1(metric.EvalMetric):\n    \"\"\"Calculate F1-Score in terms of label 1\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.focusLabel = 1;\n        super(F1, self).__init__('f1')\n\n    def reset(self):\n        self.tp = 0.0\n        self.tn = 0.0\n        self.fp = 0.0\n        self.fn = 0.0\n        super(F1, self)\n\n    def get(self):\n        try:\n            precision = self.tp / (self.tp + self.fp)\n            recall = self.tp / (self.tp + self.fn)\n            return (self.name, 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall))\n        except:\n            return (self.name, 0.0)\n\n    def update(self, labels, preds):\n        assert len(labels) == len(preds)\n        for i in range(len(labels)):\n            pred = preds[i].asnumpy()\n            label = labels[i].asnumpy().astype('int32')\n            pred_label = numpy.argmax(pred, axis=1)\n            if label.shape[0] < pred_label.shape[0]:\n                raise Exception(\"Predict label is more than data label? \")\n            ### calc f1 here???!!!\n            correct = pred_label == label[:pred_label.shape[0]]\n            incorrect = pred_label != label[:pred_label.shape[0]]\n            pos = pred_label == self.focusLabel\n            neg = pred_label != self.focusLabel\n            self.tp += numpy.sum(correct & pos)\n            self.tn += numpy.sum(correct & neg)\n            self.fp += numpy.sum(incorrect & pos)\n            self.fn += numpy.sum(incorrect & neg)\n            #print(\"tp = \" + `self.tp`)\n            #print(\"tn = \" + `self.tn`)\n            #print(\"fp = \" + `self.fp`)\n            #print(\"fn = \" + `self.fn`)\n```\n\nIt gets used like this:\n\n```\n    model.fit(\n        X                  = train,\n        eval_data          = val,\n        kvstore            = kv,\n        batch_end_callback = mx.callback.Speedometer(args.batch_size, 50),\n        epoch_end_callback = checkpoint,\n        eval_metric = metric_f1.F1())\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/172248539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/172252227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1293#issuecomment-172252227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1293","id":172252227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjI1MjIyNw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-16T20:13:06Z","updated_at":"2016-01-16T20:13:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You probably didn't build torch module correctly.
