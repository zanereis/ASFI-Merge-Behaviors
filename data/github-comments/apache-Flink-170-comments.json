@sunjincheng121, thanks for this PR.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't completely understand the implementation of the `RowsClauseBoundedOverProcessFunction`. \r\n\r\nI thought about another design, that I would like to discuss (not considering process time which should be addressed in a separate ProcessFunction, IMO.):\r\n\r\n- we have three state objects: 1) the accumulator row, 2) a MapState[Long, List[Row]] for not processed data (`toProcess`), 3) a MapState[Long, List[Row]] for processed data which needs to be retracted (`toRetract`).\r\n- processElement() puts the element in the `toProcess` MapState with the original timestamp and registers a timer for `currentWatermark() + 1`. Hence, we only have a single timer which triggers when the next watermark is reached.\r\n- onTimer() is called for the next watermark. We get an iterator over the `toProcess` MapState. For RocksDB the iterator is sorted on the key. We sort-insert the records from the iterator into a `LinkedList` (since the iterator is sorted for RocksDB this will be simple append. For other state backends it will be more expensive but we can tolerate that, IMO).  We do the same for `toRetract` MapState. So we have two sorted lists for data to accumulate and to retract. We go over both sorted lists and accumulate and retract for each step using the accumulator state. Then we emit the new row and move the emitted row from the `toProcess` MapState to the `toRetract` MapState.\r\n\r\nThis design has the benefit of using RocksDB to sort. Moreover, we could also put only those fields into the toRetract state that need to be retracted instead of the full row.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this approach?\r\n\r\nThanks, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288137332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288138441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3574#issuecomment-288138441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3574","id":288138441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODEzODQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T16:36:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T16:36:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @sunjincheng121, I think processing `OVER ROW PRECEDING` windows are a much simpler case than the event-time variant.

I finally decided to explain this directly in Jira instead of another design doc. If I understand you correctly, the differences of our design are as follows:\r\n  **-  Regard to the state:**\r\n- [ ] 1) the accumulator row -> accumulatorState (we are the same)\r\n- [ ] 2) a MapState[Long, List[Row]] -> （I did not use this, as I mentioned below, we do not a sorted map for accumulate, so it can share the same state (In my case, I just use one dataState) )\r\n- [ ] 3) a MapState[Long, List[Row]] -> (we are the same)\r\n\r\n **-  About core processing logic：**\r\n- [ ] processElement:\r\n- 1) Check if the data is late.\r\n- 2) Register timer\r\n- [ ] onTimer:\r\n- 1) toRectract -> retract (we are the same)\r\n- 2) toProcess -> accumlate (we are the same)\r\n\r\n **-  About sorting with mapState:**\r\n- toProcess -> accumlate (Do not need to sort)\r\n- toRectract -> retract (Need to sort) The purpose of sorting in `retract` is to find expired data, such as for a ` 2 proceding` over window case, the dataState is (0-> row, 1-> row, 2-> row, 3-> row), When handling element `3 ` we need find the element` 0` and `retract` it. \r\n\r\nIf the backend state is `RocksDB` and the key is Long type, then luckily the data is sorted by key ensured by RocksDB. But if we use other backend, it may not be sorted, such as (heapBackend). So the existing MapState key sorting has some limitations, unless we implement a `sortedMapState`. This semantics can ensure that any backend are ordered. So my current design uses traversal dataState.keys to find the smallest one for retraction. \r\n\r\n**- About register timer:**\r\n     I would like to use the `timestamp` to register timer. For example for `(7L, 7, \"Hello\")` I use `7` to register timer. IMO, we should not use `currentWatermark + 1` to register timer, as the currentWatermark can not be representing the \"event time\" of each data. If we explicitly use `currentWatermark + 1`, there will be problems. For instance, two data with different event time could be arrival at same time. Then we will get the same register timer (because we have not updated currentWatermark). So eventually, these two data will different event time will be emitted at the same time, which is unexpected.\r\n\r\nFYI, examples (using my design) are as follows:\r\n（Refer to:[ `testBoundPartitionedEventTimeWindowWithRowWithLateEvent`](https://github.com/sunjincheng121/flink/blob/FLINK-5990-PR/flink-libraries/flink-table/src/test/scala/org/apache/flink/table/api/scala/stream/sql/SqlITCase.scala)）\r\n

Let me share the views of the registration timers:\r\n\r\nIn our point of view, register timer should be correlated to the event time of the current data, but not currentWaterMark (which is correlated to the event time of the previous datas) . Using the previous event time (`currentWatermark + 1`) to register the timer for current data may cause some problems IMO. I do not have whole lots of counterexamples for now, just intuitively think this is not the correct way. One example I have is: \r\n\r\nData line -> ...               5   7 4   3   2 \r\nWatermark line -> ...  5    4      3   2 1\r\n\r\nIn this case, assuming when watermark is `3`，we get `4` and `7`, then we use ` currentWatermark + 1` to register timer `timer(3+1)` for both `4` and `7`. When watermark goes to `4`，timer `timer(3+1)` be triggered (then `4` and `7` will be emitted). After this, data `5` comes (while the watermark is still `4`), then we register timer `timer(4+1)` for 5. This is incorrect, as we should always ensure data `5` is triggered before data `7`. I run a test case, and printed the results of [event time][currentWatermark] as below. I hope it can help to explain my point.\r\nDatas:\r\n```\r\n(1L, 1, \"Hello\"),\r\n(2L, 2, \"Hello\"),\r\n(4L, 4, \"Hello\"),\r\n(3L, 3, \"Hello\"),\r\n(5L, 3, \"Hello\"),\r\n(7L, 7, \"Hello\"),\r\n(6L, 7, \"Hello\"),\r\n(8L, 8, \"Hello World\"),\r\n(7L, 8, \"Hello\"),\r\n(5L, 5, \"Hello\"),\r\n(20L, 20, \"Hello World\"),\r\n(9L, 9, \"Hello World\"))\r\n```\r\nEvent time of each data & Watermark: (newTS_currentWM[event time][currentWatermark])\r\n```\r\nnewTS_currentWM[1][-9223372036854775808]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[2][-1]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[4][0]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[3][2]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[5][2]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[7][3] // a data with event time 7, it will be registered timer to (3+1)\r\nnewTS_currentWM[6][5] // a data with event time 6, it will be registered timer to (5+1)\r\nnewTS_currentWM[8][5]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[7][6]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[5][6]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[20][6]\r\nnewTS_currentWM[9][18]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother important reason of using allowedLateness to configure the watermark in my design is that, in our point of view, watermark is a semantics which is correlated to the stream lateness SLA. User exactly knows the tuple of (SLA, allowedLateness). For instance: \r\n\r\n******************************************\r\nA system which always ensure the order:\r\nSLA(100%) = Watermark(eventTime)\r\n******************************************\r\nFor flink system process out of order data, and user have different watermarks indicating different SLA levels:\r\n (SLA, allowedLateness) = Watermark(eventTime - allowedLateness)\r\n (SLA(80%), 0) = Watermark(eventTime)\r\n (SLA(90%), 2)  = Watermark(eventTime - 2)\r\n (SLA(95%), 5)  = Watermark(eventTime - 5)\r\n\r\nWe want to keep the interface to let user configure the allowedLateness(AssignerWithPeriodicWatermarks|AssignerWithPunctuatedWatermarks), thereby the correlated SLA. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\nThanks,\r\nSunJincheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288608700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288613419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3599#issuecomment-288613419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3599","id":288613419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODYxMzQxOQ==","user":{"login":"wenlong88","id":20785829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzg1ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20785829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88","html_url":"https://github.com/wenlong88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenlong88/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T04:20:48Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T04:20:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @WangTaoTheTonic I think we can improve the reaction of ZookeeperLeaderElectionService on zookeeper connection expired or other errors instead of introducing the AlwaysLeaderService such as adding a retry before revoking leadership, because when the problem is caused by errors on the machine which JM is running on, we need to trigger a failover to make the JM change a machine. \r\nOn the other hand, in the coming FLIP-6 implementation, JM failover will not trigger cancelling all running tasks.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288613419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288614747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3574#issuecomment-288614747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3574","id":288614747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODYxNDc0Nw==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T04:32:52Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T04:32:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, @fhueske Sounds good.

With `ListState` we can get efficient access to the head element of the list. However, when updating the `ListState`, we cannot remove individual elements but have to clear the complete state and reinsert all elements that should remain. Hence we always need to deserialize and serialize all elements of a `ListState`.\r\n\r\nWith the `MapState` approach, we would put the elements in a map which is keyed on their processing timestamp. Since multiple records can arrive within the same millisecond, we use a `List[Row]` as value type for the map. To process a new row, we have to find the \"oldest\" row (i.e., the one with the smallest timestamp) to retract it from the accumulator. With `ListState` this is trivial, it is the head element. With `MapState` we have to iterate over the keys and find the smallest one (smallest processing timestamp). This requires to deserialize all keys, but these are only `Long` values and not complete rows. With the smallest key, we can get the `List[Row]` value and take the first Row from the list and retract it from the accumulator. When updating the state, we only update the `List[Row]` value of the smallest key (or possible remove it if the `List[Row]` became empty).\r\n\r\nSo the benefit of using `MapState` of `ListState` is that we only read `n` Long (+ read/write 1 `List[Row]`) instead of reading and writing `n` Row values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288646109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288651626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3590#issuecomment-288651626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3590","id":288651626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODY1MTYyNg==","user":{"login":"rtudoran","id":16573790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTczNzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16573790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran","html_url":"https://github.com/rtudoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T08:40:32Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T08:40:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske @sunjincheng121 \r\nI have done another commit (actually i did it last evening but the network of the machine was down and did not push it). What i did was:\r\n1)address the formatting issues (i hope i did not miss (too) many)\r\n2) added some new tests including for processingtime. I did not find the reference to what @fhueske mentioned but i created a custom source that emits events 1 second apart. This gives us a good framework about events arriving with processing time 1 second apart, so we can run any tests and validate. I think this is quite relevant\r\n3) I did update the processing functions. However, i am still using the ValueState[Queue[JTuple2[Long,Row]]]= _ for buffering the events. As per my previosu mentioning - i strongly believe this is a better approach. Having the events sorted by their order is an advantage that we should not loose. Otherwise we will pay a high price later (sorting, limit, top, distinct...). We pay some price for serialziation, but as we do this over a full object it should be relatively ok rather than serializing independent objects (like in hash map...IMHO)\r\n4) I kept the

It is possible that the first AM will be still running when launching the second AM in some scenario like NM heartbeat timeout but running.\r\n\r\nWhen it is possible that there are two AM running at

I haven't looked at the changes yet. Just a few general remarks to your comments:\r\n\r\n1. thanks!\r\n2. we do not use tests which are based on manual timing of operations. These tests are typically very fragile and take a lot of time. The test harness I was pointing to solves this issue by controlling the processing time service of the ProcessFunction, i.e., we can control the time. See how  [WindowOperatorTest#testProcessingTimeTumblingWindows()](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/runtime/operators/windowing/WindowOperatorTest.java#L1080) controls processing time using the [KeyedOneInputStreamOperatorTestHarness]( https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/util/KeyedOneInputStreamOperatorTestHarness.java).\r\n3. Using `ValueState` has the overhead of always serializing and deserializing all data. The actual access inside the deserialized data is probably much less of an issue than the de/serialization + object instantiations itself. With `MapState` we can get ordered access to elements by accessing only the `Long` keys. This will also help for the operations you mentioned.\r\n4. In order to use `MapState` we would need to use the `NullByteKeyExtractor` approach, since non-keyed operators only support `ListState`\r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288685074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/288690260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3409#issuecomment-288690260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3409","id":288690260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODY5MDI2MA==","user":{"login":"beyond1920","id":1525333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920","html_url":"https://github.com/beyond1920","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beyond1920/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T11:27:24Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T11:27:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske @twalthr , thanks for the reviews.
