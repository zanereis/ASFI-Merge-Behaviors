@koushik-das \n\nI've reviewed the code in this PR and it looks pretty good. I really like what might seem like small things (lower-case on method names, extra spaces in log messages, etc). It shows attention to detail. Kudos for that.\n\nI would like to run this somehow. Can you give me some pointers to how can I do that?\nI mean, I get I need to run the simulator (although I never have before, I will learn), but then what about data center config to be deployed? \nI assume that the test `smoke/test_scale_vm.py` will be the one to hit this code.\n\nAlso, if I can suggest an improvement, I would make the commit message (and the PR title along with it) more concrete. I mean, you do specify three changes in the body of the message, but the header is what we typically read in the commit history. I would re-write it as (your second bullet point): \"Added support for scaling up a running VM in simulator\". It seems to me like the best balance between explaining the intention of the change and not adding too much low-level

let's not do this for multiple reasons;\n- by closing a PR which has not got attention we risk forgetting about it and losing the contribution\n- generally those of us who have worked for long in the community or have dayjob colleagues working in the community, have better chances in getting their PRs merged; for new contributors this pattern is not encouraging and certainly not welcoming if their PRs get closed just because it did not caught any attention in one month's time\n- our community works on the premise that everyone is a contributor working as per their convenience, interest and time, on top of this the developer community is not very large to ensure that all PRs will get attention or review within a months time of its arrival\n- the requirement of 2 LGTM on each review makes it too much process-oriented that costs time and efforts, sometimes fixes are small but getting them merged has taken more

servers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134922676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134923025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/577#issuecomment-134923025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/577","id":134923025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDkyMzAyNQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-26T09:38:57Z","updated_at":"2015-08-26T09:38:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134923025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134923368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/577#issuecomment-134923368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/577","id":134923368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDkyMzM2OA==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-26T09:39:25Z","updated_at":"2015-08-26T09:39:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"maybe
