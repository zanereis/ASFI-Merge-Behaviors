I think the easiest could be using ping times between supervisors. That could be done in a fair time frame. \r\n\r\nA more complicated scoring will need to take many statistics into consideration, for example, the transferring latency between tasks, serialization/deserialization cost, current load in downstream executors, and the execution latency of executors and etc. It's also interesting to see if we could apply any machine learning algorithms. But it should take a lot of time to do it. We don't have any plan on this currently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/323524640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/323544379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2268#issuecomment-323544379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2268","id":323544379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzU0NDM3OQ==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-19T19:55:34Z","updated_at":"2017-08-19T19:55:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR Done.

rel=\"revans2\">Robert Joseph Evans</a>: hi again Bobby!  This is another change that broke storm-on-mesos.  It's <b>much</b> worse for us though than the breakage caused by the previous change I brought up before (<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2018?focusedCommentId=16108307&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16108307\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">STORM-2018</a>).   We've already worked around that issue.   However, this change has switched the nimbus scheduling from being Slot-centric to being Supervisor-centric.  Specifically this changed the behavior of the code path that takes the slots returned from <tt>INimbus.allSlotsAvailableForScheduling()</tt> and eventually propagated into <tt>INimbus.assignSlots()</tt> &#8211; if a Supervisor doesn't already exist then the slot information is no longer respected.   And for storm-on-mesos the supervisors do not exist a priori &#8211; they are launched onto hosts when a topology needs to be launched.  So the storm-on-mesos integration was relying on the nimbus to take the slots and call assignSlots even without a supervisor yet existing.</p>\n\n<p>It is unfortunate that we inherited this messy interface between Storm and Mesos which allowed for this kind of seemingly purely improved code  (it <b>is</b> much more readable!) to actually break storm-on-mesos.  I have some ideas for hacking around it which may eventually be done, but I'm curious if you have any ideas for how we can fake there being Supervisors even when there aren't actually any supervisors yet?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612958174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/323937639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2261#issuecomment-323937639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2261","id":323937639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzkzNzYzOQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-22T07:01:46Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T07:58:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Now I have another numbers to persuade this patch.\r\n\r\nI just take same approach to what @Ethanlm is done with his patch #2270 \r\nPerformance testing on ConstSpoutNullBoltTopo with ACKing disabled.\r\n\r\n1.

We're dealing with network latency which is much bigger than what optimization can bring to.\r\n\r\nBtw, when you are doing the test with 1 worker, you don't need to test both LocalOrShuffle and Shuffle, since LocalOrShuffle is just a shuffle with limiting tasks to local if possible.

Yes, you are right. In this case LocalOrShuffle and Shuffle are the same. I just wanted to be consistent with above experiments. \r\nComparing the results of ours, it looks like the `new LocalOrShuffle` will get similar performance with`LocalityASG` on single worker mode. I personally think the numbers here should be good for now (especially those cases with more network latency) and if it gets merged in, we can start working on some follow-up improvements.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/324125370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/324164824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2199#issuecomment-324164824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2199","id":324164824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDE2NDgyNA==","user":{"login":"Ethanlm","id":14900612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14900612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethanlm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-22T22:04:33Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T22:04:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR  Thanks for the comments!

I noticed that I incorrectly said something important earlier that I want to correct...  actually the ACKer is slower than the inter-worker (and not the other way around as I accidentally said). \r\n\r\nYour observations about LoadAware are similar to mine ...  which i discovered when doing STORM-2306. \r\n\r\nWith STORM-2306, both ACKer and inter-worker throughputs are a good deal higher than master (but nowhere close to where they really should be)..

Avg latency is close, max latency is 2x+ higher in ACK mode.

It feels like it could easily replace local or shuffle as the performance is almost identical to it.  The only thing it is missing is some load aware work, and once #2261 goes in I would be happy to help combine the two together.
