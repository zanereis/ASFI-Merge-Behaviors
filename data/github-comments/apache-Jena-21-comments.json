I think we need a corresponding Jira issue on issues.apache.org to keep track of this enhancement and the release it appears in - could you open one @DamienFontaine please?\r\n2. You should add unit tests that exercise the new sections of code.

The release of class initialization lock plays the necessary role in establishing the happens-before relationships between the actions in static initializers and any users of the static fields. Naively speaking, the propagation of memory effects requires any reader of static field to acquire the class initialization lock first, but JLS allows to elide that locking, if the memory effects are still maintained. Indeed, modern VMs do this optimization routinely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/599237130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/599424818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/709#issuecomment-599424818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/709","id":599424818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTQyNDgxOA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-16T09:12:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T09:12:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Class intialization does not work in this case. `generateAcceptedParams` is calling object methods so `static class` doesn't compile.

It reflects experience with `DatasetAccessor`. \r\n\r\nThere is a split into \"read\" and \"read-write\" so that \"read\" can be provided on its own. Compile time robustness not \"UnsupportedOperationException\".\r\n\r\nBetter names to be task focused. \"fetch\" because \"get\" is more common as getter in Java and some IDE tools do rely on that.\r\nRemove the unnecessary \"Model\".\r\n`add` -> `load` -- hopefully clearer because it has been a source of questions. YMMV.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of `DatasetAccessor` to `RDFDatasetConnection`::\r\n```\r\n    @Override public default Model getModel() { return fetch();}\r\n    @Override public default Model getModel(String graphName) { return fetch(graphName);}\r\n    @Override public default boolean containsModel(String graphName) { return true; }\r\n    @Override public default void putModel(Model model) { put(model); }\r\n    @Override public default void putModel(String name, Model model) { put(name, model); }\r\n    @Override public default void deleteDefault() { delete(); }\r\n    @Override public default void deleteModel(String name) { delete(name); }\r\n    @Override public default void add(Model model) { load(model); }\r\n    @Override public default void add(String name, Model model) { load(name, model); }\r\n```\r\n\r\n> why FileManager is being deprecated\r\n\r\nIt's not. Some operations are deprecated.\r\n\r\nIt's still in `OntDocumentManager` because of the Jena module structure (i.e. legacy).\r\n\r\nAt runtime, the global `FileManager` is actually an `AdapterFileManager` and the machinery is a `StreamManager`.\r\n\r\n> We are willing to contribute its code\r\n\r\nGreat but as I asked last time, what advantage is there in making it part of Jena? It has a cost - it has to be maintained and it slows Jena evolution down. Does it have it's own community around the code to support it? Is there a community of users to become contributors?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/653550180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/653735763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/759#issuecomment-653735763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/759","id":653735763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzczNTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"namedgraph","id":849526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTUyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/849526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph","html_url":"https://github.com/namedgraph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namedgraph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-04T07:56:16Z","updated_at":"2020-07-04T07:56:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I misread about the requirements...\r\n\r\nI can't think of any requirements for Jena's flexibility except having modular interfaces that conceptually represent RDF specs and satisfy the UIC (can be shared by the server and the client).\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like about `RDFDatasetConnection` is the \"connection\"-focus. I think \"accessor\" made more sense. And then `close()` and `isClosed()` got added which are implementation-specific and not conceptual, as [I was trying to explain to Rob](https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/666#issuecomment-651104758).\r\n\r\nCore does not have a community around it. But there are other Linked Data frameworks that cross Jena with JAX-RS - e.g. [Apache Clerezza](https://clerezza.apache.org/) and I think there were more. Just like frameworks rely on Jena for well-established RDF API, they do so on JAX-RS for an HTTP API.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind Core seems to be similar to https://github.com/afs/jena-http. But IMO depending on JAX-RS should not slow the development. Quite the opposite - having constraints such as an existing standard API lets us focus on features rather than API design.\r\n\r\nIf you don't agree, it's OK. We will continue as we have done.
