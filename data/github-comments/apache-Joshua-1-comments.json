I see [a project](https://github.com/mjpost/berkeleyaligner) in @mjpost 's github which has ant build  so I couldnt do local maven install to try it out. Should we need to port that to maven build or do you know a quick way to install ant jar to maven local?\n- [The original licence is GPL v2](https://code.google.com/archive/p/berkeleyaligner/), I am not sure if it has been relicensed to Apache. Can we add this as dependency to create a fat jar of all dependencies?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/219616619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/219620953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/joshua/pull/12#issuecomment-219620953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/12","id":219620953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTYyMDk1Mw==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T05:12:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T05:12:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can build it locally by simply using the following scope\n\n```\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>edu.berkeley.nlp</groupId>\n      <artifactId>jberkeleyaligner</artifactId>\n      <version>X</version>\n      <scope>system</scope>\n      <systemPath>/path/to/berkeleyaligner.jar</systemPath>\n    </dependency>\n```\n\nI think you can remove the version element for the time being and try that out.

Consequently, isDebugEnabled() is always returning true, but the logging statements are not printed anywhere visible. So the work is getting triggered, and is just not seen, and that is the problem.\n\nI've pushed up the merge. Can you folks take care of making sure that the logger file is running correctly? You can test this by running\n\n```\ncd $JOSHUA/src/test/resources/bn-en/hiero/\ntime ./test.sh\n```\n\nDepending on your hardware, of course, that should run in just a few seconds tops.\n\nIncidentally, there are at least two other problems I am hoping you can help address?\n-  I see how to build a big tarball and run Maven that way, but that's a pain for development, since you have to incur the time of rebuilding the tarball. Is there a way to just run against the files in target/classes directly? I've tried this, but the problem is that the jar dependencies don't seem to get downloaded anywhere. \n-  Your response might be, \"actually, you just have to regenerated the tarball, that's the proper way to do things.\" In which case, can you describe how to make eclipse do this? Right now, when I'm developing, eclipse is always compiling files, so you can just switch over and test right away. It's a small but significant paint to have to type \"(cd $JOSHUA; mvn compile assembly:single install\"\n-  I really like being able to use the `-v` (verbosity) flag to Joshua, which sets the debugging level. This is much simpler than changing a properties file and linking to that from the command line. Is it possible to set the log4j debug level programmatically based on the value of -v? We could do\n  \n     -v 0 = OFF\n     -v 1 = INFO\n     -v 2 = DEBUG\n  \n  Or I would be okay to switch to those values directly (e.g., \"-v OFF\").
