Rather than allowing a runner to choose how to report metrics, it pushes drop wizard into the cross-runner implementation. This has other affects too, such as making it impossible to support meters across only the successfully committed work.\n\nA lot of the complexity seems to come from the trying to use drop wizard directly while also supporting the general case of metrics with committed values if a runner supports them.\n\nI'd like to see a discussion on the dev@ list about whether moving towards the workers reporting metrics directly to a plugin. If we like this approach, it means we can remove all the cruft around combining/storing metrics in separate cells/etc. Assuming that makes sense, we should still think about whether we want that top level connection to be made directly to drop wizard or through a layer of indirection allowing other libraries.\n\n---\n\n*[pom.xml, line 1140 at r4](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555#-Kp19tbbylCvL-_NJvd_:-Kp19tbbylCvL-_NJvda:b-whggvx) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/aa9bff62c8b88cc8c6a36ec224b799d7217dbb4d/pom.xml#L1140)):*\n> ```XML\n> \n>       <dependency>\n>         <groupId>io.dropwizard.metrics</groupId>\n> ```\n\nWhy are we adding dropwizard as a top-level dependency?\n\n---\n\n*[runners/core-java/pom.xml, line 99 at r4](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555#-Kp1AA0Vvad8uhYwzMca:-Kp1AA0Vvad8uhYwzMcb:bl4kp1j) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/aa9bff62c8b88cc8c6a36ec224b799d7217dbb4d/runners/core-java/pom.xml#L99)):*\n> ```XML\n> \n>     <dependency>\n>       <groupId>io.dropwizard.metrics</groupId>\n> ```\n\nDitto -- dropwizard should be an implementation detail on those runners that report to dropwizard, correct?\n\n---\n\n*[runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterCell.java, line 38 at r4](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555#-Kp1AGjycjkaup_Fr4lL:-Kp1AGjycjkaup_Fr4lM:bbv5jnb) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/aa9bff62c8b88cc8c6a36ec224b799d7217dbb4d/runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterCell.java#L38)):*\n> ```Java\n> \n>   private final DirtyState dirty = new DirtyState();\n>   private transient com.codahale.metrics.Meter value = new com.codahale.metrics.Meter();\n> ```\n\nWrapping Meter like this will make it impossible for any runner to implement meters without using a drop wizard Meter.

wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nThis departs from the current approach to metrics. Rather than allowing a runner to choose how to report metrics, it pushes drop wizard into the cross-runner implementation. This has other affects too, such as making it impossible to support meters across only the successfully committed work.\n\nA lot of the complexity seems to come from the trying to use drop wizard directly while also supporting the general case of metrics with committed values if a runner supports them.\n\nI'd like to see a discussion on the dev@ list about whether moving towards the workers reporting metrics directly to a plugin. If we like this approach, it means we can remove all the cruft around combining/storing metrics in separate cells/etc. Assuming that makes sense, we should still think about whether we want that top level connection to be made directly to drop wizard or through a layer of indirection allowing other libraries.\n</blockquote></details>\n\nBen, Thanks for your comments. I'm ok to extend the discussion further before pulling this commit. So I'll reply on my proposal doc.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/315510913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/315512185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3555#issuecomment-315512185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3555","id":315512185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTUxMjE4NQ==","user":{"login":"unsleepy22","id":631361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22","html_url":"https://github.com/unsleepy22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unsleepy22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-15T05:53:36Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T05:53:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*[runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterCell.java, line 73 at r4](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555#-Kp1AXj1Ga34Inr-wHGE:-Kp3j5qqlTDPpPMWA1BI:b-3jlml2) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/aa9bff62c8b88cc8c6a36ec224b799d7217dbb4d/runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterCell.java#L73)):*\n> support\nThere're two ways currently to merge metrics. The first is through Accumulators, in Flink, this works only after the job has finished (doesn't make too much sense for streaming apps IMHO), and since it's one-time-off merging, perhaps alignment doesn't matter.\nThe other way is forwarding beam metrics to runner metrics(current implementation) or delegating beam metrics to runner metrics(my proposal). For the former, currently we only use the count of Meter to update runner's Meter and drop m1, m5, m15 and mean rates(they're only used for Accumulators). For the latter, it's simpler because \"Meter.mark\" in beam calls directly to runner's \"Meter.mark\" and we don't even bother about merging, it's the job of external services like OpenTSDB. And it depends on metrics reporters to align the metrics.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io

Or can we calculate an accurate sum of mean rates? Especially for meters with different start times. I think m1,m5,m15 are more referable numbers. Even so, I still think your example is reasonable acceptable because the mean rate of each meter depicts the average rate calculated so far, i.e, an static value at 10:00, it makes sense to sum them together to get a total mean rate for all meters at that time.\n\nFor the second problem, I'm not sure about the use case, could you take an example? \n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from
