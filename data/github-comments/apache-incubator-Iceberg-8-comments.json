It is unfortunate that Iceberg uses id-based schema evolution rather than using the name-based evolution that ORC natively supports. My original plan for ORC in Iceberg was to use the column ids to munge the column names so that ORC's schema evolution would do the right thing. So basically if the file had column \"foo\" as id 5 and the reader wanted \"bar\" as id 5, the Iceberg reader would munge the \"bar\" to \"foo\" and pass that down to ORC and then ORC's schema evolution would do the appropriate translations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/505109236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/505138230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/227#issuecomment-505138230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/227","id":505138230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTEzODIzMA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-24T19:03:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T19:03:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@omalley, I think the proposal is not to write separate JSON files.

It has some nice features that I'd like to have in Maven. This appears to be a strict improvement over the current situation.\r\n\r\nOne problem this doesn't seem to solve is requiring dependency declarations for everything that is used directly. For example, before 37f6a20f324b23c26773b24259ee78d067d41323, the code was directly referencing `commons-compress`, but there was no direct dependency. The classes happened to be on the classpath via the `avro` dependency. This is solved in Maven via [`dependency:analyze`](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html#The_dependency:analyze_mojo). The Gradle equivalent seems to be [gradle-dependency-analyze](https://github.com/wfhartford/gradle-dependency-analyze) although I'm surprised there's not a more \"official\" solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/506831767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/506963273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/239#issuecomment-506963273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/239","id":506963273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjk2MzI3Mw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-29T15:02:41Z","updated_at":"2019-06-29T15:02:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi,

I think it is a good idea to have a way to detects changes and prepare an update. But I think we need to be careful about some of the choices made in this commit:\r\n* New features should be done in the core Java library so any client can use them, not just Spark\r\n* It looks like this only detects new fields. What about fields that are removed? Also, using a Spark schema for detection means that this can't use schema IDs, so it can't tell the difference between a rename and a drop followed by add. That's probably another reason to build change detection between Iceberg schemas.\r\n* Usually, we try to keep recursion logic and business logic separate by using the visitor pattern. I think that adding a visitor that traverses two Iceberg schemas at the same time, like the Parquet `TypeWithSchemaVisitor`, would help simplify the code and would be useful for other tasks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/509023025/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/509023128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/250#issuecomment-509023128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/250","id":509023128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTAyMzEyOA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-07T19:05:16Z","updated_at":"2019-07-07T19:05:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue @rdsr one question: we define Jackson dependency as 2.7.9 but Spark 2.4.0 seems to use 2.6.7.1, which gives me `JsonMappingException` at runtime.
