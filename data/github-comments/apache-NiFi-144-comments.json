Bouncy Castle 1.67 and 1.68 enhanced support for these Elliptic Curves and TLS 1.3.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing the Bouncy Castle version upgrade, several unit tests started failing in different methods due to apparent timeout issues.  The test classes for `InvokeHTTP` and `ListenHTTP` as well as `PutTCP` relied on the `SSLContextService` implementation class, which resulted in instantiating a new `SSLContext` for each test method.

I'll be testing some corner cases today to see if i can cause any errors. One thing that I noticed, though, is that there is nothing added to the User Guide for this feature. Probably makes sense to update the User Guide to note that the feature exists, and to explain some of the caveats.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I run in a cluster and I have a processor configured to run on Primary Node only and I click Run Once, it runs only on the Primary Node, not all nodes. If Execution is set to All Nodes, it is triggered once on every node. It's worth clarifying that in the docs.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the processor's outbound connection has backpressure applied, I am able to click Run Once, but it doesn't actually get triggered. Similarly, if there is an incoming connection and the connection is empty, it doesn't get triggered. These are good things and I believe the correct/desired behavior. But I think it's important to explicitly call these things out in the User Guide.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772652269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772666915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4798#issuecomment-772666915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4798","id":772666915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjY2NjkxNQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T17:04:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T17:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was able to cause an error with the following scenario. Given, the scenario is contrived, but it can definitely happen \"in the wild\" based on the timing of events when nodes and joining/rejoining to cluster. Steps to reproduce (assumes a 2 node cluster:\r\n\r\n1. Create dataflow: GenerateFlowFile -> DebugFlow -> UpdateAttribute\r\n2. Set DebugFlow's `@OnScheduled Pause Time` property to `1 min`\r\n3. Start the processor\r\n4. Shut down Node 2\r\n5. Remove Node 2 from the cluster\r\n6. Stop processor, wait for thread to complete\r\n7. Click Run Once\r\n8. While processor is running, start Node 2\r\n\r\nNode 2 will now join the cluster. However, when the single trigger completes, we will have Node 1 with a Scheduled State of STOPPED, and Node 2 with a Scheduled State of RUNNING. Node 2 did not properly inherit the cluster's Scheduled State for the Processor when the Scheduled State was RUN_ONCE.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is because in `StandardFlowSynchronizer` we don't take the `RUN_ONCE` state into account in the `updateProcessGroup` method. On line 918, we have the following block:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                        case STOPPED:\r\n                            if (procState == ScheduledState.DISABLED) {\r\n                                procNode.getProcessGroup().enableProcessor(procNode);\r\n                            } else if (procState == ScheduledState.RUNNING) {\r\n                                controller.stopProcessor(procNode.getProcessGroupIdentifier(), procNode.getIdentifier());\r\n                            }\r\n                            break;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we need to change this to something like:\r\n```\r\ncase STOPPED:\r\ncase RUN_ONCE:\r\n                            if (procState == ScheduledState.DISABLED) {\r\n                                procNode.getProcessGroup().enableProcessor(procNode);\r\n                            } else if (procState == ScheduledState.RUNNING || procState == ScheduledState.RUN_ONCE) {\r\n                                controller.stopProcessor(procNode.getProcessGroupIdentifier(), procNode.getIdentifier());\r\n                            }\r\n                            break;\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772666915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772677768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4748#issuecomment-772677768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4748","id":772677768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjY3Nzc2OA==","user":{"login":"pgyori","id":63872658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODcyNjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63872658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori","html_url":"https://github.com/pgyori","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgyori/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T17:19:33Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T17:19:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you, @markap14 !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772677768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772690763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4798#issuecomment-772690763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4798","id":772690763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjY5MDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T17:38:35Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T17:38:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also found that if you configure DebugFlow with `@OnScheduled Pause Time` set to \"80 secs\" (or anything over 1 minute) the framework will time it out and interrupt the @OnScheduled task.

I should be able to terminate/interrupt the Run Once action.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772693921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772703211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4800#issuecomment-772703211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4800","id":772703211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjcwMzIxMQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T17:57:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T17:57:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution @JonathanKessler.

I didn't realize there were other additional protocols supported by the library. Personally I'm a bit torn on how I think we should best approach it. We can have a single property for specifying which protocols to support, but that has the downside that it's a bad user experience. It requires that the user look up the documentation each time to understand exactly what needs to be typed in, and must then type it in whereas the boolean approach allows them to just select the value (when it's appropriate). We could add an additional property for each protocol that that means we'd be adding several properties to a processor that already has *a lot* of properties.\r\n\r\nWhat it really comes down to, IMO, is a trade-off between power vs. ease of use. The boolean property is easier to use when it applies (which I think is going to be > 99% of the time) but is less powerful because it doesn't support the additional protocols. The other options are not as nice a user experience but are more powerful.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think we should lean more toward ease of use than power, so I think I prefer the boolean.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772719837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/772720409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4800#issuecomment-772720409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4800","id":772720409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjcyMDQwOQ==","user":{"login":"JonathanKessler","id":19499288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk5Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19499288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler","html_url":"https://github.com/JonathanKessler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanKessler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T18:23:23Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T18:23:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 You make a valid point.

I don't think we should ever expire data on any connection without a user explicitly configuring that connection to do so.\r\n\r\nThere is a small indicator on the connection, but it is easily missed, especially if you're not looking for it. And many users, especially newer ones, may not know what that icon means. If they notice it and go searching to find what it means, it will be easy to figure out, but it won't necessarily jump out at them.\r\n\r\nI would also consider it an anti-pattern to go through a flow and start marking all connections with expiration dates. Typically you have a flow that has many processors, and expiration would be configured on the end of that dataflow only. There's no real need to age the data off in the middle. If age off is configured only at the end, the data will age off as necessary, and even if there's backpressure applied the aging off will allow data to continue through the flow and get to the end where it will be aged off.\r\n\r\nCertainly, configuring backpressure throughout the flow could result in being more efficient if you have a lot of data by aging off the old data more aggressively. But at what cost? If ageoff is set to 5 mins and you decide you now want it to be 10 minutes, you now have to go through potentially hundreds of connections and update them. This would get unwieldy very quickly.\r\n\r\nI very much appreciate the work that you've put into this. It's a non-trivial PR, for sure.
