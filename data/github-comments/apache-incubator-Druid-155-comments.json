It should be possible to merge at least two of them, so leaving just two dimensions, or preferably one dimension.\r\n\r\nI guess you mean merging read/write with preemptive/non-preemptive. The motivation here is compaction tasks should not block the tasks submitted by users. For example, let me suppose there are two tasks, a realtime indexing task and a compaction task which optimizes the segments generated by the realtime task. The realtime task can try to append new data for an interval while the compaction task is running for the same interval because some events might arrive late, and even in such a case, the compaction task should not block the realtime task. Please note that the lock is acquired for an interval, not individual segment. I think preemptible write lock is a simple solution to solve this problem. Please let me know if you have any better idea.\r\n\r\n> Also, I suggest to explore \"read - restructure (compaction, merge, append) - new data (realtime index, batch index)\" dimension, it might be helpful.\r\nAlso, something here might be isomorphic to the tri-level read-write-update system.\r\n\r\nI think it's a nice idea and closely related to fine-grained locking. Actually, fine-grained locking is a quite large issue to be addressed here. I'll raise a new issue for fine-grained locking if it's
