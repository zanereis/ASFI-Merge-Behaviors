Good work here. A few more comments on the behavior. I haven't had a chance to dig in yet but want to share some initial thoughts. \r\n\r\n- I think the `Stop & Configure` menu item should be available when the component is stopped but there are active threads. This is most easily testable using `DebugFlow` and setting the `On Trigger Pause Time`. Should this menu item be visible under the same conditions as the `View configuration` menu item?\r\n- Should the status bar be visible when it's unneeded?\r\n- Quickly looking at the changes introduced into the jquery dialog component, I'm wondering if we should decouple the status bar content so that there's no dialog instance specific things in there. The fact that we're rendering component status, threads, and bulletins there are very specific to this use case and probably shouldn't be in the generic dialog component. What if we wanted to take this approach with other dialogs and other components that may report status differently (like active transmission for remote ports)? The fact that the button model is configurable is great.\r\n\r\n@moranr Any thoughts?

I say this because the processor is already displaying the \"Stopped\" icon even when it has active threads and seeing a \"Stop & Configure\" button persisting probably would lead the user to think their prior \"Stop & Configure\" action was not successful. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n- As far as the status bar being visible when its not needed, the feedback I've gathered from users has been pretty consistent in that when opened, the configuration dialog window tends to overlay the processor element on the graph and thus prevent the user from knowing the current state [ie- Started/Stopped/Invalid/Validating/Disabled]. The current implementation covers all states the processor could potentially achieve in the status bar and I can't see the harm in continuing to provide that state visualization. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n- Lastly, I do see your point on not having the status bar as part of the jquery.modal component. I too wasn't a fan of putting it there, but I placed the logic there in order to avoid replicating code across the two dialog windows as it was a common point to both that I could leverage the button model logic already present. I will take a look at it and see if I can decouple that further to be more generic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/474793462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/474795166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3281#issuecomment-474795166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3281","id":474795166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDc5NTE2Ng==","user":{"login":"aeaversa","id":36886905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg2OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36886905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa","html_url":"https://github.com/aeaversa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-20T11:43:40Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T11:43:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@moranr - As far as the button text, the main concern I got from users was that when it was just plain text, users didn't realize it was actually clickable, so I tried to accentuate it.

The main objective of the feature was seeking was to provide a more direct path for the user that allows them to edit a processor's properties, and having that direct option in the context menu i would say is super important. I think @mcgilman was just pointing out the fact that in the change the \"View Configuration\" menu option needs to be updated to \"Configuration\" when a processor is in a stopped state with active threads, since now the Processor Configuration modal will simply disable the Apply button and provide the user a Terminate button in the status bar should the user wish to apply their changes quickly. @mcgilman Let me know if I understood you correctly on that. I am not married to the pencil-square icon, but it does seem that all the context menu items all have an icon, so I'm open to suggestions. :-) Thanks to everyone for all the great feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475198401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475312349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3351#issuecomment-475312349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3351","id":475312349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTMxMjM0OQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T16:50:38Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T16:50:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijokarumawak My comment regarding the port count was focused on the number of available ports.

I'd like to get @moranr and @andrewmlim  thoughts on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475312349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475357357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3383#issuecomment-475357357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3383","id":475357357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTM1NzM1Nw==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T18:47:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T18:47:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475357357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475462251","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3382#issuecomment-475462251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3382","id":475462251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTQ2MjI1MQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T01:28:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T01:28:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Reviewing..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475462251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475464620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3382#issuecomment-475464620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3382","id":475464620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTQ2NDYyMA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T01:42:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T01:42:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @mattyb149 for the improvement!

Sorry for taking time to give you review feedback.\r\n\r\nI looked at the hbc client source code. I believe this part is the one you mentioned on the JIRA description that hbc client handles exponential retry. Am I correct?\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/hbc/blob/ce61517be1e726fb4f5809786af86e14a559a4d7/hbc-core/src/main/java/com/twitter/hbc/httpclient/ClientBase.java#L220-L232\r\n\r\nIf so, the client code handles all 4xx HTTP status codes the same. Probably we shouldn't treat 420 special. Instead, we should avoid reconnecting for all HTTP_ERROR events including 500.\r\n\r\nTo be specific, what the hbc client does for 4xx and 5xx status codes is that reconnectManager just wait for a while exponentially to make another request.\r\nFor 4xx, the client exits with STOPPED_BY_ERROR after it receives 4xx more than configured retry count (defaults to 5). That makes sense because 4xx represents errors due to bad client request. Keep sending the same request indefinitely will not recover the error.\r\nFor 5xx, there's no retry limit. That makes sense, because 5xx represents server side errors. Retrying may recover the error.\r\n\r\nIn contrast,  what `client.reconnect` does is stop reading the successful response and reconnect the API again.\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/hbc/blob/ce61517be1e726fb4f5809786af86e14a559a4d7/hbc-core/src/main/java/com/twitter/hbc/httpclient/ClientBase.java#L133\r\n\r\nFrom above, I think we should not call `client.reconnect` for any HTTP_ERROR cases.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475539434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475600400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3374#issuecomment-475600400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3374","id":475600400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTYwMDQwMA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T12:20:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T12:20:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...\r\n\r\nLooks like Travis died on you (not necessarily due to any problem on your end), so I'll run the build manually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475600400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/475697725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3276#issuecomment-475697725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3276","id":475697725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTY5NzcyNQ==","user":{"login":"k0urge","id":27643232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjQzMjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27643232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge","html_url":"https://github.com/k0urge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0urge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T16:56:57Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T16:56:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @ijokarumawak,\r\n\r\nThat's correct, I was referring that piece of code from the Twitter HBC library.

I feel the proposed changes with this PR looks overkill to realize the requested feature.

How does a user know the number when they configure this processor? I'm probably missing something, but I can't imagine situations well where the `N` is a static constraint.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we may be able to add new `Evaluation Mode` such as `The First Line` and `The Last Line`, as I see few other users wanted to replace only header or footer of a text file.\r\n\r\nHow do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476429999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476474798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3375#issuecomment-476474798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3375","id":476474798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjQ3NDc5OA==","user":{"login":"pushpavanthar","id":8515997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTU5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8515997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar","html_url":"https://github.com/pushpavanthar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pushpavanthar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T04:51:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T04:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ijokarumawak, thanks for reviewing.\r\nThe requirement in the _NIFI-5979_ JIRA was just to replace the header values. However, I was thinking of below use-cases \r\n\r\n1. I need to replace all occurrences of a text/regex except for the header and/or footer. If the content has fixed number of rows this can be achieved by using _Occurrence Offsets_ and _Number of Occurrences_\r\n2. This might be a specific use-case, but I strongly believe that many might come across such case. Consider a json as payload, which has \"cityCode\":\"NYC\" and \"city\":\"NYC\", suppose \"NYC\" is also present in \"address\" and \"description\" fields.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"cityCode\": \"NYC\",\r\n \"city\": \"NYC\",\r\n  \"address\": \"200 W 44th St, NYC, NY 10036, USA\",\r\n  \"description\": \"The Theater District is the teeming heart of Midtown West, NYC. In the pedestrian plazas of Times Square, costumed characters beckon to energetic crowds under the pulsing lights of towering digital billboards.

On busy 42nd Street, chain stores and restaurants abound.\"\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n But I chose to keep \"cityCode\":\"NYC\" and  \"city\":\"NYC\" untouched and want to change the rest of the occurrences of \"NYC\" to \"New York City\" where I can make use of _Occurrence Offsets_ .

The issue as described was that we have a Processor running someplace. Upon viewing the Processor Details, the user realizes they need to update some configuration and the process to do so is extremely cumbersome. I can see why @moranr was surprised by its addition of a new menu item. I was also thrown off by it a little bit which is why I wanted to make sure @moranr could review it. \r\n\r\nIf we are considering a case where the Processor is running and the user wants to configure it (not from the Processor Details dialog) I would suggest we take a combined approach. The user would still select the Stop menu item from the context menu as they would today. From there we could immediately show the Configure menu item even if there are active threads since we won't activate the Apply button until those threads complete.\r\n\r\n@aeaversa I can understand the code duplication concern with extracting the run state, threads, and bulletins out of the dialog. However, I think you should be able to create some utility function that Processors can utilize which can return some general type (maybe a jQuery instance) so we don't need that type of business logic within the dialog widget itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476781200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476798684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3281#issuecomment-476798684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3281","id":476798684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njc5ODY4NA==","user":{"login":"aeaversa","id":36886905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg2OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36886905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa","html_url":"https://github.com/aeaversa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T18:56:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T18:56:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mcgilman . Yeah, my plan was to move the status bar code into its own jQuery based component that can be extrapolated onto any element. That way the code remains shared between both modals or whatever interface you want to consume the capability. As far as the context menu.... I too wasn't happy with the original icon, so I did redo it (see screen shots attached), I've also cleaned up the status bar button look and feel per @moranr 's feedback. Hopefully I've met the desired look and feel he was going for, but if not let me know.  I know the goal of this feature was attempting to provide an efficient navigational route to get the processor to a state where the user can make configuration changes, hopefully via a single click.  Adding the Stop & Configure option in the context menu does get the user there in one click, so are we sure we want to take that option away? My thanks again for all the great feedback on this.\r\n\r\n![ss1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36886905/55025380-39ee6b00-4fd7-11e9-9882-46af701516b7.png)\r\n![ss2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36886905/55025381-39ee6b00-4fd7-11e9-9b66-f4a9425ff9a9.png)\r\n![ss2-mouse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36886905/55025382-39ee6b00-4fd7-11e9-867e-f3b3088d41a0.png)\r\n![ss3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36886905/55025384-39ee6b00-4fd7-11e9-931d-e79bf6675e3b.png)\r\n![ss4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36886905/55025385-39ee6b00-4fd7-11e9-825f-430c36464e31.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476798684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476833667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3391#issuecomment-476833667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3391","id":476833667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjgzMzY2Nw==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T20:22:37Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T20:22:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476833667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/476877817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3391#issuecomment-476877817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3391","id":476877817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njg3NzgxNw==","user":{"login":"sapinamin","id":4481720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE3MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4481720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin","html_url":"https://github.com/sapinamin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapinamin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T22:29:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T22:29:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bbende Pls let me know once you have reviewed and merged it.
