The new toggle would be --activate-profiles '!python-container'. That is not a good long-term solution because poms are gross enough with hacks kept to a minimum.\r\nWe could also remove the --also-make-dependents since I think the Python SDKs model of including all code in a single module makes it irrelevant. My experience trying to run build all submodules, as with --projects runners is that it does not build submodules by default, so you can build --projects sdks/python and it will not automatically build the submodule.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like these hacks would silence the problem but it can still manifest in a different context down the road. If we consider hacks for the sake of this release branch, I would cherrypick 38a9cdb08f3d682f7c0d32aadbc645a34dd56639 into the branch, which adds sdks/python/containers/pom.xml and presumably will make Jenkins happy. And then we should figure out a long-term solution that uses job configs from the branch for Jenkins presubmit runs for the branch. Filed: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3047.\r\n\r\n> The alternative (ignoring the results) is not viable because tests fails early on without executing anything else. \r\n\r\nI ran locally in the brach directory the following commands. Does this gives us enough confidence that this PR is safe to merge?\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -pl sdks/python -am -amd \r\nmvn clean install -pl sdks/java/core,runners/direct-java -am -amd\r\n```\r\nBoth runs were successful and finished within 4 and 20 min respectively. Jenkins runs take around an hour.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/336011315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/336011333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3978#issuecomment-336011333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3978","id":336011333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjAxMTMzMw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T03:33:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T03:33:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There

- Has Dataflow always created Datasets/Tables in BigQuery? I've never seen it do that before, and I always through it exported tables/queries to GCS for reading into the pipeline. The issue we are now seeing is that our Dataflow pipelines share the same project id as our BigQuery users.\r\n\r\nSo, these temp datasets/tables are now showing up in their web UI. Our BigQuery users know nothing about Dataflow and the pipelines we run behind the scenes for them - they just ETL the data in and out of BigQuery. It's abstracted from the BigQuery users.\r\n\r\nWe've had several users contact us asking why they suddenly see these weird looking datasets and tables in the BigQuery Web UI e.g:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-09 at 5 06 15 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5554342/31530787-77e96922-b02e-11e7-8cf6-28aa24d87211.png)\r\n\r\nThis is not a good experience for our BQ users.\r\n\r\nAlso, what if a batch pipeline takes more than 24hrs? We've had batch pipelines run close to that due to sheer volume of data its ingesting and writing.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nGraham\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/336350056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/336356612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3729#issuecomment-336356612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3729","id":336356612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjM1NjYxMg==","user":{"login":"mairbek","id":549048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTA0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/549048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek","html_url":"https://github.com/mairbek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mairbek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T05:48:04Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T05:48:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"weird

I believe dataflow always created temporary datasets when reading from\na query (except perhaps in some versions before 2.0? I'm not sure but I\ndon't think so, because Bigquery doesn't have a feature to directly export\nresults of a large query to files). Query results are exported to a\ndataset, then the dataset is exported to files and the dataset is deleted,\nthen the job processes the files and the files are deleted at some point.\n\nOn Thu, Oct 12, 2017, 9:53 PM Graham Polley <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @jkff <https://github.com/jkff> - Has Dataflow always created\n> Datasets/Tables in BigQuery? I've never seen it do that before, and I\n> always through it exported tables/queries to GCS for reading into the\n> pipeline. The issue we are now seeing is that our Dataflow pipelines share\n> the same project id as our BigQuery users.\n>\n> So, these temp datasets/tables are now showing up in their web UI.
