Yes - there is no annotations to automate injections, but still it's extremely easy to do. All injectors use the same approach as available for javassist too: proxies, deep reflection and etc. \nAnd one more point: I wouldn't say that injection is key point for profiler. Last one should be transparent for application's logic. So profiler should not change application's fields, arguments and etc. It should be one level up.\n\nThere is not need to compile core classes: we are profiling custom app and not core. So the main target for instrumenting, should be custom code, but not core themselves. There is quite thin boundary: if you check my code - it's dynamically overrides core methods in a custom class. So even pure Page's core methods can be profiled.\n\nRegarding support of Component's: it's really depends on how IClassResolver is being used in wicket.

Yes - there is no annotations to automate injections, but still it's extremely easy to do. All injectors use the same approach as available for javassist too: proxies, deep reflection and etc. \n\nBut is is done in a programmatic way and not with a simple:\n\n@Around(\"execution(\\* org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter.processRequestCycle(..))\"\n\nfor example.\n\n> Strange, because AspectJ manipulates/instruments classes with a behavior which is not needed in a system which do not use metrics. AspectJ and javassist use the same way to operate: instrumenting of code.\n\nIf you let away any AspectJ jars and the dependency to wicket-metrics - wicket-core behaves like before. If you add the AspectJ jars and the dependency to wicket-metrics - the aspects are weaved around the method / constructor calls and the metrics are created. (This is an advantage of the agent usage)\n\n> There is not need to compile core classes: we are profiling custom app and not core. So the main target for instrumenting, should be custom code, but not core themselves. There is quite thin boundary: if you check my code - it's dynamically overrides core methods in a custom class. So even pure Page's core methods can be profiled.\n\nThat is not right in general. Imagine the circumstances that the user has a lot of AjaxLinks and override the onClick mechanism within an anonymous inner class. The code is implemented by a customer, but the class is provided by wicket-core and because of this also core classes would be needed to be manipulate.\n\nAlso if you want to measure the request time, you have to consolidate core classes.\n\n> And one more point: I wouldn't say that injection is key point for profiler. Last one should be transparent for application's logic. So profiler should not change application's fields, arguments and etc. It should be one level up.\n\nThat is not a good idea. One requirement was to log the actual request which reached the server (also with url): \nhttps://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/master/wicket-experimental/wicket-metrics/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/metrics/aspects/request/WicketFilterRequestCycleUrlAspect.java#L54\n\nThis would not be possible anymore if you do it the way you suggested.\n\n> Btw, I have question regarding AspectJ implementation: java agents has ability to be attached remotely to a working java processes. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/attach/index.html\n> Is it a case for AspectJ? If it's a case: using agent become actually a good pro.\n\nI didn't had a look at the attach API yet, but it would be a great advantage if you could setup your own \"metrics logging server\" indeed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/217837350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/218571214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/170#issuecomment-218571214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/170","id":218571214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODU3MTIxNA==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T19:55:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T19:55:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Overall it is OK, but I don't like that there is so much duplicated code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/218571214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/218976648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/170#issuecomment-218976648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/170","id":218976648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODk3NjY0OA==","user":{"login":"bitstorm","id":536912,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjkxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536912?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm","html_url":"https://github.com/bitstorm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitstorm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T07:59:08Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T07:59:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @martin-g and thank you for your reviw,\n\nas you noted the code contains some classes where code is repeated.

I suspect this is due to the fact that the Application#initializeComponents() is called before the Application#init() method, where one would normally register the class loader? \n\nCaused by: org.apache.wicket.WicketRuntimeException: Unable to create org.ops4j.pax.wicket.internal.Initializer\n    at org.apache.wicket.core.util.lang.WicketObjects.newInstance(WicketObjects.java:385)\n    at org.apache.wicket.Application.addInitializer(Application.java:587)\n    at org.apache.wicket.Application.load(Application.java:633)\n    at org.apache.wicket.Application.initializeComponents(Application.java:511)\n    at org.apache.wicket.Application.initApplication(Application.java:829)\n    at org.apache.wicket.protocol.http.WicketFilter.init(WicketFilter.java:427)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/225457251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/225602868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/171#issuecomment-225602868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/171","id":225602868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTYwMjg2OA==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T14:45:45Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T14:46:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see.\nThere was a discussion recently about this at dev@wicket.apache.org.\nTo setup the custom IClassResolver you have to use `Application#internalInit()` instead of `#init()` in that case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/225602868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/225640613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/171#issuecomment-225640613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/171","id":225640613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTY0MDYxMw==","user":{"login":"cnoelle","id":19640096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjQwMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19640096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle","html_url":"https://github.com/cnoelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnoelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T16:50:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T16:50:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, that does solve it.

I guess some applications will need to enable an expensive validator in some use case, so we will have to make it configurable. And it will become more complex than it needs to be.\n\nIMO it is simple enough to check whether the current request is Ajax one in the validator and decide what to do. One can even use request parameters/headers for even more flexibility.\n\nThis is just my opinion! Let's see what others think too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/240349759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/240349815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/176#issuecomment-240349815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/176","id":240349815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDM0OTgxNQ==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T08:40:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T08:40:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"X-Ref:
