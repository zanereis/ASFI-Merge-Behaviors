This would allow admins to put their customizations. A solution could be to do both, so the fat jar has the UI files and however `ServerDaemon` would set the webapp path to the /usr path by default (if available) and fallback to assets in the jar when not found.\r\n- The DB files are kept out of the jar in case someone want to fix any upgrade failure issue. It's kind of subjective. My opinion is to bundle them in the jar, which reduces file management and opens scope for changes to the sql paths.\r\n- In addition, a lot of people may want to consume additional jars (plugins etc) which is why bounty castle and other jars may be put at `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/lib`. When mgmt server starts, we scan and include all the jars at this path in the classpath, with them first in the order in case someone want to overide any bundled jar etc.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/323338821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/323362107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2239#issuecomment-323362107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2239","id":323362107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzM2MjEwNw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-18T14:01:47Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T14:01:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Pinging for review @nvazquez @borisstoyanov @DaanHoogland @wido @marcaurele @GabrielBrascher @rafaelweingartner @ustcweizhou @pyr and others\r\n\r\n@blueorangutan package\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/323362107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/323362193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2239#issuecomment-323362193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2239","id":323362193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzM2MjE5Mw==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-18T14:02:08Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T14:02:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rhtyd a Jenkins job has been kicked to build packages.
