I also updated the `TestFlowResource` unit tests to provide some additional filtering examples.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/997225825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/997283406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5615#issuecomment-997283406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5615","id":997283406,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM47cVZO","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-18T20:54:12Z","updated_at":"2021-12-18T20:54:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Push additional commit upgrading Log4j 2 from 2.16.0 to 2.17.0 for NIFI-9505.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/997283406/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/997303331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5321#issuecomment-997303331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5321","id":997303331,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM47caQj","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-19T00:09:43Z","updated_at":"2021-12-19T00:09:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We're marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past few months.

A couple of things to consider here...\r\n\r\nThe implementations of `FlowPersistenceProvider` shouldn't have any knowledge or access to the metadata service, their job is to store and retrieve the content of a flow snapshot, and optionally return metadata if implementing `MetadataAwareFlowPersistenceProvider`. The registry service/framework layer coordinates activities between the metadata service and persistence providers. \r\n\r\nWe'd likely want to expose something on `MetadataAwareFlowPersistenceProvider` that can be called by the service layer to synchronize the provider, or maybe it can be part of the existing call `getMetadata()` and the git implementation just happens to perform the synchronize. \r\n\r\nRegistry is also designed to hold multiple times of versioned items, currently there are flows and bundles (NARs). The `FlowSynchronizer` only populates the database when there are no existing buckets which indicates a brand new database, it was meant to be a one time sync when starting a new registry from an existing git repo.\r\n\r\nThere will have to be a bit more logic to figure out how to update an existing database based on the metadata from git, while also preserving other types of versioned items that may exist in buckets and came from another type of persistence provider.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1004934862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1004965060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5550#issuecomment-1004965060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5550","id":1004965060,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM475ozE","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-04T16:36:15Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T16:36:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix & the updates @turcsanyip!

I'm a bit concerned about the notion of adding an \"eager\" fetch though. It results in some significant changes to the framework, and it tends to be taking us in a direction that I don't personally believe is the right direction. It means that in order to use Merge related processors you'll need to know that and configure the engine as such. Otherwise the Merge processors will still appear to work but won't merge anything, which can flood downstream systems with millions of tiny files, etc. Plus it's a bit confusing for users because you're configuring something that is very specific to the dataflow from outside of the dataflow.\r\n\r\nI think we can address the issue very differently, though. Simply by updating MergeContent / MergeRecord so that they only create the smallest bin if they first poll and have no data available. Otherwise, we don't 'process' a bin unless the bin is full.

@simonbence - I gave this another try and I'm a bit concerned on how this would work when processing a flow file containing a lot of CEF logs but with one line not being correctly formatted according to CEF specifications. Right now, if a single line cannot be parsed, the whole flow file would fail (when using a processor such as ConvertRecord). Can we think of a solution to always successfully parse a line but parse it in a specific way so that filtering between \"good\" and \"bad\" records can be done? I'm wondering if, similarly to the property RAW_FIELD, we could have an INVALID_FIELD, and if specified, the line would not be parsed but a record with a single field containing the raw line would be produced. This way, when using a processor like QueryRecord processor, it'd be super easy to do the conversion from CEF to JSON while also filtering bad and good records in two distinct flow files.

You are right for those operations of we want to address the individual component we would need something more dynamic. To address that need we could use the args to target individual components and for all the other operations we could utilise the knowledge provided by the design and pre-define the acceptable operands to make the operation more targeted e.g.: CLEAR (repository / connection), UPDATE (configuration, c2, agent). As I wrote earlier I believe it would help to write safer / more maintainable code on the long run.

Case 1 looks reasonable to me: as far as I aware, readers when facing with parsing issues will throw exception (AvroRecordReader looks like a good example as Avro has pretty bounded formatting just like CEF) which will be handled by the processor somehow. ConvertRecord inherits AbstractRecordProcessor where the basic behaviour for these cases is to propogate the exception wrapped into a ProcessException. So all in all this looks to the \"usual behaviour\" for readers. As for Case 2, it looks less fortunate, I need to check it. I will find you back with my findings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1012066630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1012067908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5530#issuecomment-1012067908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5530","id":1012067908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48Uu5E","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T11:54:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T11:54:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yep, case 1 is what I was expecting but I was surprised by the behavior of case 2 :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1012067908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1012265782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5650#issuecomment-1012265782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5650","id":1012265782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM48VfM2","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T15:53:09Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T15:53:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the additional feedback and testing @gresockj!
