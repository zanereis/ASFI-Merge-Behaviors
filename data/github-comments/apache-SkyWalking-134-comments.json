As you were using 6.1.0, you should reboot the agent after you upgrade. Last thing, H2 default if in memory mode, if you reboot the backend, agent is required to reboot too due to data lost. Auto agent hot reboot(don't need to reboot agent) is supported from 6.4.0, you could check the change log.\r\n\r\nA simple question, are you using SkyWalking for test or production? If test considering you are using H2, why there is an upgrade scenario.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/557897911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/557898034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3924#issuecomment-557898034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3924","id":557898034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzg5ODAzNA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-24T15:15:36Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T15:15:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">
