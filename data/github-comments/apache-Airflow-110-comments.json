Yes I agree that we should combine aws related hooks in 1 file. Will create a new PR to add aws related hooks  (EMR, DynamoDB and Lambda) in aws_hook.py.. once thats done, I am going to decline my PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2586 and submit a fresh PR with the hook. Once we start adding more operators we can take similar approach. thanks again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/341402018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/341402812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2747#issuecomment-341402812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2747","id":341402812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTQwMjgxMg==","user":{"login":"samelamin","id":4311963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTE5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4311963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin","html_url":"https://github.com/samelamin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samelamin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-02T12:13:51Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T12:13:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have refactored the commits based on your comments\r\n\r\nHowever I do not see any reference to tests for these classes, if it helps I refactored the PR to use the dag's following_schedule for intervals as seen [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/a81c153cc48e4c99a9e0a5047990b84c5d07e3cb/airflow/operators/latest_only_operator.py)  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/341402812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/341405413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2723#issuecomment-341405413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2723","id":341405413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTQwNTQxMw==","user":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-02T12:25:55Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T12:25:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ho, thanks that will help a lot !
