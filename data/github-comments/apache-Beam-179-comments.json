approach, they'll get an error \"please specify a bucket\" and:\r\n- In case 1, they will specify it.\r\n- In case 2, they will specify an output prefix like gs://something/basename.\r\n\r\nWith your suggested approach, they'll get no error and:\r\n- In case 1, they'll most likely get an error \"bucket gs://something does not exist\" which is a little confusing but understandable.\r\n- In case 2, the pipeline will succeed but they'll get wrong-named files, notice it only after the fact, and will have to rerun the pipeline.\r\n\r\nAssumption X is the critical one; if it's valid, then my
