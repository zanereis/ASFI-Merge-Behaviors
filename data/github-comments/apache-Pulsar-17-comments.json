If we can break compatibility with the existing version, I think we should make data in Message class return bytes type like getMessage of Java Client.\r\n\r\nI think that as well.. Using `message.data()` to return bytes seems a better option: \r\n\r\n * In Python 2.7, there should be no difference between `bytes` and `string` as I understand\r\n * In Python 3.x, it's actually very tricky to return a proper string from the API, since we don't know the eventual string encoding, if it is a string a all. \r\n * By always returning `bytes` we force the user to deal and reason about the encoding, and it will be the same as in C++ and Java (C++ string can actually hold whatever content). \r\n\r\n@kyontan Thanks for finding this out and the change looks good, can you also update the `pulsar.py` wrapper documentation to specify that the return type will be `bytes`?
