I am not sure if this is configureable..\r\n> \r\n> Is that the right way to work? Releases are easily found/downloaded via the releases \"Tab\" here on github. I think that is the right place to point users to: https://github.com/apache/celix/releases\r\n> \r\n> Source is for developers IMO, not users.. I think it makes much more sense to have \"develop\" the main branch.\r\n\r\nIs it even the right way to work to use develop as main branch? We are promoting releases through the asf mirror system (they can be downloaded from GitHub as well). \r\n\r\nThe source repository contains our latest code. Why not use the master branch for our latest code then? It seems other Apache projects are using the master branch for their latest sources as well, e.g.: [apache/spark](https://github.com/apache/spark), [apache/dubbo](https://github.com/apache/dubbo), [apache/flink](https://github.com/apache/flink), [apache/storm](https://github.com/apache/storm), [apache/hbase](https://github.com/apache/hbase), [apache/avro](https://github.com/apache/avro). They all use the master branch for their latest sources and I'm sure other projects do the same.\r\n\r\nE.g. Apache Spark also maintains `branch-*` branches for every minor release. In our case this could be a `branch-2.1` for a (possible) follow-up 2.1.1 release. Or if 3.0.0 is released and someone asks for a (quick) fix for 2.2.0?\r\n\r\nEDIT: It seems we have a patch to #157 which fixes something for the 2.2.0 release. Ideally this will be released as 2.2.1.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Also the ASF environment allows us to use an [.asf.yaml](https://s.apache.org/asfyaml) file for changing [repository settings](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/.asf.yaml+features+for+git+repositories#id-.asf.yamlfeaturesforgitrepositories-GitHubsettings) or [notification e-mail addresses](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/.asf.yaml+features+for+git+repositories#id-.asf.yamlfeaturesforgitrepositories-Notificationsettingsforrepositories). Because the file is only accepted on the master branch we need to change the master branch anyway when we want to change any of these settings. Maybe it's better to continue this as a separate topic on the dev@ list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/616429007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/616434228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/95#issuecomment-616434228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/95","id":616434228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjQzNDIyOA==","user":{"login":"rlenferink","id":10008950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA4OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10008950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink","html_url":"https://github.com/rlenferink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-20T09:42:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T09:42:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No I didn't work on this @abroekhuis.
