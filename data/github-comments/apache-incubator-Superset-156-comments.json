Then, when exploring the graph, I got the following URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://192.168.1.144/superset/explore/?form_data={\r\n\"datasource\":\"20__table\",\r\n\"viz_type\":\"big_number_total\",\r\n\"slice_id\":213,\r\n\"granularity_sqla\":\"ts_depot\",\r\n\"time_grain_sqla\":null,\r\n\"since\":\"1+months+ago\",\r\n\"until\":\"\",\r\n\"metric\":\"sum__nbre_projets\",\r\n\"adhoc_filters\":[{\"subject\":\"source\",\"operator\":\"==\",\"filterOptionName\":\"filter_hf45d8jnxcr_yani27kg2u\",\"expressionType\":\"SIMPLE\",\"sqlExpression\":null,\"fromFormData\":true,\"comparator\":\"TRAVORAMA\",\"clause\":\"WHERE\"}],\r\n\"y_axis_format\":\".0f\",\r\n\"timeseries_limit_metric\":null,\r\n\"include_search\":false,\r\n\"percent_metrics\":[],\r\n\"color_pn\":true,\r\n\"include_time\":false,\r\n\"table_timestamp_format\":\"%Y-%m-%d+%H:%M:%S\",\r\n\"table_filter\":false,\r\n\"groupby\":[],\r\n\"url_params\":{},\r\n\"page_length\":0,\r\n\"row_limit\":10000,\r\n\"order_desc\":true,\r\n\"having\":\"\",\r\n\"order_by_cols\":[],\r\n\"filters\":[{\"col\":\"source\",\"val\":\"TRAVORAMA\",\"op\":\"==\"},{\"col\":\"label_categorie_initiale\",\"val\":[\"Pose+de+clôture+en+grillage+rigide+(1881)\"],\"op\":\"in\"}],\r\n\"all_columns\":[\"ts_depot\",\"nom_projet\",\"label_categorie_initiale\",\"etat\",\"nbre_selections_brut\",\"Nbre+recrédits\"],\r\n\"metrics\":[],\r\n\"having_filters\":[],\r\n\"align_pn\":false,\r\n\"where\":\"\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe result is that the temporal filter that was defined with the Filter box is preserved, as is the filter on the `source` field defined on the graph independently from the Filter box. The condition on `label_categorie_initiale` has not been kept though. Both the chart definition form and the actual result displayed match.\r\n\r\nIn explore, when I manually add the missing filter, the URL changes into\r\n```\r\nhttp://192.168.144/superset/explore/?form_data={\r\n...\r\n\"adhoc_filters\":[{\"subject\":\"source\",\"operator\":\"==\",\"filterOptionName\":\"filter_hf45d8jnxcr_yani27kg2u\",\"expressionType\":\"SIMPLE\",\"sqlExpression\":null,\"fromFormData\":true,\"comparator\":\"TRAVORAMA\",\"clause\":\"WHERE\"},{\"subject\":\"label_categorie_initiale\",\"operator\":\"in\",\"filterOptionName\":\"filter_t892zpelzhm_9rszhbvraaq\",\"expressionType\":\"SIMPLE\",\"sqlExpression\":null,\"fromFormData\":true,\"comparator\":[\"\\\"Pose+de+clôture+en+grillage+rigide+(1881)\\\"\"],\"clause\":\"WHERE\"}],\r\n...\r\n\"filters\":[{\"col\":\"source\",\"val\":\"TRAVORAMA\",\"op\":\"==\"},{\"col\":\"label_categorie_initiale\",\"val\":[\"\\\"Pose+de+clôture+en+grillage+rigide+(1881)\\\"\"],\"op\":\"in\"}],\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow there are two `adhoc_filters`.\r\n\r\nConversely, if I now remove completely the `adhoc_filters` directly from the explore URL, it reverts to the first scenario (temporal filter + preset filter defined on the chart).  If instead I remove completely the `filters` and put back the `adhoc_filters`, everything works fine (temporal filter + preset filter defined on the chart + manual filter).\r\n\r\nIt seems therefore the `filters` option is ignored, and this could be the root of the problem, because when exploring after using a filter box the filters seem to be passed only through the `filters` argument.\r\n\r\nWhat should be the normal behavior?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/406601741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/406613376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4874#issuecomment-406613376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4874","id":406613376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjYxMzM3Ng==","user":{"login":"nunohelibeires","id":34506966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTA2OTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34506966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires","html_url":"https://github.com/nunohelibeires","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunohelibeires/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-20T14:14:28Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T14:14:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@betodealmeida do you have a spare min to review this PR ?

Further suppose that we would like to calculate the count by subject and grade. In this case, we can use either visualization type:\r\n\r\n### Table View\r\n|subject|grade|count|\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n|English|A|50|\r\n|English|B|85|\r\n|English|C|39|\r\n|English|D|12|\r\n|English|F|0|\r\n|Math|A|44|\r\n|...|...|...|\r\n\r\n### Pivot

percentage of students by letter grade within each subject, we are out of luck. `Table View` exposes \"Percentage Metrics\", but the percentages use the number of students across all subjects and letter grades as the denominator.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, \"Percentage Metrics\" were implemented for `Pivot Table` and this added a percentage for each column calculated over the row total, we would be able to express the ask.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this would be a useful feature (although I'm sure there are design/implementation details to nail down), and hopefully the example above illustrates how such a feature would extend Superset's expressiveness in tabular \"visualizations\" even further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/406697119/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/406700721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/952#issuecomment-406700721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/952","id":406700721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjcwMDcyMQ==","user":{"login":"suyile","id":26680289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjgwMjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26680289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile","html_url":"https://github.com/suyile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suyile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-20T19:13:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T19:13:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could
