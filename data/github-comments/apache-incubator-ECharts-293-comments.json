@pissang @Ovilia @regrex \r\n\r\nIf there `[DISCUSS_layout_config]` above is OK, what about the label position config?\r\n\r\nCurrently, for vertical layout, funnel `label.position` supports \r\n`'insdie'`/`'insideLeft'`/`'insideRight'`/`'left'`/`'right'`/`'leftTop'`/`'leftBottom'`/`'rightTop'`/`'rightBottom'`.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n\r\n## Question 1: \r\n\r\nThere are counterintuitive behavior for `'leftTop'`/`'leftBottom'`/`'rightTop'`/`'rightBottom'` in currently `layout: 'vertical', sort: 'ascending'`, (might be a existing bug):\r\n\r\n```js\r\norient: 'vertical', \r\nsort: 'ascending'\r\nlabel: {\r\n    position: 'rightTop'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut actually the labels are placed at the position \"rightBottom\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/84107438-2e5a5900-aa50-11ea-8ab2-c5ba52346599.png)\r\n\r\nAnd \r\n```js\r\norient: 'vertical', \r\nsort: 'ascending'\r\nlabel: {\r\n    position: 'rightBottom'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nactually the labels are placed at the position \"rightTop\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/84107485-53e76280-aa50-11ea-9efa-dcdf25c30783.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason probably be: the implementation of label position is only according to the case of \r\n`sort: 'descending'`. So if set to `sort: 'ascending'`, the behavior is counterintuitive and seams do not follow the convention of echarts option.\r\n\r\nThus the question is: should we correct it?\r\nIf we correct it, that would be a break change. Is it worth to do that? \r\n\r\n\r\n<br> \r\n\r\n## Question 2: \r\nNow we need to support `orient: 'vertical'`, the same problem occurs:\r\nhow would we design the meaning of `label.position` values `left`/`right`/`leftTop`/`leftBottom` ... ?\r\n\r\n(A) If we follow the \"counterintuitive\" design: the position should be only understand on the case of `sort: 'descending', orient: 'vertical'` and \"rotate in mind\" to the final effect. \r\n\r\nIt is counterintuitive:\r\n```js\r\norient: 'right',\r\nlabel: { position: 'right' } // use position right to place label on bottom\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/84108226-48953680-aa52-11ea-8d71-14a25f813813.png)\r\n\r\nBut that would be simple in implementation and do not need to worry about break change (described in question 1). In a sense, it can be reasonable since funnel is literally something always \"vertical\" in mind:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/84113717-af6c1d00-aa5d-11ea-80de-c366d954e899.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(B) Make it totally follow the intuitive:\r\n`label.postion: 'top'` means label is top.\r\n`label.postion: 'rightTop'` means label is right top.\r\nBut it might have break change, and bring little complex in code.\r\n\r\nSo the question is: (A) or (B)
