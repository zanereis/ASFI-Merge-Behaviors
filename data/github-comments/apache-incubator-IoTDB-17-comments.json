you want to reconnect the server if the network is broken because the network problem or some others in the client side, it is ok to use sessionPool in 0.10.1.\r\n But there is a bug for reconnecting the server (if the server is restarted) when using sessionPool in 0.10.1. \r\nyou can compile source code from rel/0.10 or master branch to get a bug-fix version.\r\n\r\n如果你想在客户端网络出问题时重连，0.10.1的sessionPool就可以。\r\n但是这个版本在服务器重启的情况下，sessionPool有个重连的bug。已经在rel/0.10和master分支上修复了。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/690152455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/690829483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/1524#issuecomment-690829483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/1524","id":690829483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MDgyOTQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"liukun4515","id":7450163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTAxNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7450163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515","html_url":"https://github.com/liukun4515","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-11T02:06:29Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T02:06:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please
