Thanks for updating your code!\r\n\r\nThe change make sense, and is documented: thanks for a great first-time contribution. I believe there are a few issues left.\r\n\r\n * Renaming the `private_ip_address` parameter to `ip_address` would be more consistent with most of the drivers. Not sure about prefixing `private_ip_allocation_method` with `_ex`.\r\n * Azure ARM appears to accept IPv6 addresses, so documenting the address to be IPv4 is too restricting.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, those are nitpicks. But a more important issue: we need a test before we can merge this feature! `ex_create_network_interface` is not tested directly, but through  `test_create_node`. There's a fixture at `fixtures/azure_arm/_subscriptions_99999999_9999_9999_9999_999999999999_resourceGroups_000000_providers_Microsoft_Network_networkInterfaces_test_node_1_nic.json` that you should
