Those are very informative. So it seems that the the url need to be updated and II need to rebuild the amber packages w/ the patch, correct?\r\n> \r\n> When building, I'm running into another error, which wasn't there previously. Probably another 3rd party dependency issue.\r\n> https://ci.bigtop.apache.org/view/Test/job/Build-Deploy-Smoke-Test-Pull-Request-Single-Distro/14/console\r\n> Let me try to get around this.\r\n> \r\n> In the meantime, I've looked into the PR again. I've concern on how ODPi's mpack work. It seems the JAR/binary is contained in the patch file, making the patch 20MB large.\r\n> Can we get ride of this? Why the jars need to be included instead of fetched and packaged?\r\n\r\n@evans-ye  really sry for the late response.\r\n\r\nFor ODPi Mpack has been included in Ambari trunk, it just added some build and deploying srcripts in bigtop to make itself work. But the ODPi Mpack doesn't work now and no guys would maintain it.\r\n\r\nFor the BGTP Mpack in this PR, it has not been merged in Ambari.\r\nSo the [PR #3073](https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3073) was proposed and `patch3-AMBARI-MPACK.diff` is used as the mirror-file for  [PR #3073](https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3073) .\r\n\r\n`patch3-AMBARI-MPACK.diff` composed of 158 files including Json, py and other scripts. \r\nFirstly we retain this mirror-file to make BGTP mpack work in Bigtop and we will remove this mirror-file when [PR #3073](https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3073) is merged. \r\nWDYT?
