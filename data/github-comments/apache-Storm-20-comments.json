for review:</p>\n\n<p>1) When there is an exception , what is the purpose for waiting for the exit code? Based on the code it seems either by the time ShellProcess.java sees an error either the child process has exited or it has no knowledge of failure so it will continue running. In both cases waiting will not be helpful. <br/>\n2) As a general best practice I have observed in code we either log a message or we put the message as part of exception but never both. This item seems to be asking for both.

I would like to see us try to get the exit code of the subprocess and report it somehow, just because the exit code often has important information in it.   Inside ShellProcess.readShellMsg where it catches a NoOutputException it might be a good place to do this, there may be others too.  I don't care how we record it. either logging it or including it as part of the exception should be fine.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612456716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612456723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4108#issuecomment-2612456723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4108","id":2612456723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NTY3MjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-17T23:47:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:49:40Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
