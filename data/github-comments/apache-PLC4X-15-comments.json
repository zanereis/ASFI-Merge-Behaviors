wow ... great to see that you folks at Amazon are using PLC4X ... at least for S7 ... you might want to consider also using it for some of the other protocols as I see Modbus, ADS and even OPC-UA that we also support. I see you're using Milo for OPC-UA, but Modbus and Ads perhaps instead of re-implementing them, using PLC4X and helping iron out any issues you run into could be a more sustainable approach?\r\n\r\nBut always happy to see PLC4X being used and us being able to help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1930284843/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1931181034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/596#issuecomment-1931181034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/596","id":1931181034,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85zG3vq","user":{"login":"glcj","id":15176267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTc2MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15176267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj","html_url":"https://github.com/glcj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-07T02:56:13Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T02:56:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Many of the driver's features are documented on the page.
