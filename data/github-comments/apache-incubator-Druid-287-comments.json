If so, even if the Coordinator used `LookupExtractorFactoryContainer` instead of `LookupExtractorFactoryMapContainer`, the `DefaultPasswordProvider` would still have a visible password in its serialized form.\r\n> \r\n> You could consider using an `EnvironmentPasswordProvider` in your JDBC extraction namespace instead, so the password doesn't appear\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. If we use `LookupExtractorFactoryContainer` in coordinator, we should load all LookupExtractorFactory extensions when it start. Otherwise, coordinator cannot recognize the right implement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/564343178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/564706872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8697#issuecomment-564706872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8697","id":564706872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDcwNjg3Mg==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T19:56:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T19:56:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson thanks for reviewing and you are right about LGTM alert ...

complete?\r\n- Each druid services and emit metrics: https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/metrics.html\r\n- You can enable metrics emission by following: https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/index.html#enabling-metrics and https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration/index.html#emitting-metrics\r\nHow can i find out what and where is the bottle-neck?\r\n- For initial steps to find bottle-neck, make sure you have set the runtime.properties correctly in both broker and historical.\r\n- There can be many factors affecting the query performance such as, segment sizing, number of historical nodes, high volume of data in query response, the type of query being executed (whether you can use/modify the query, check for topN, groupBy and timeseries)\r\n\r\nHope this helps you figure out some things.

sorry for the confusion. You got the right idea. `distribution/bin/find-missing-backports.py` searches for all PRs which are in master but not in the given milestone branch.

[Gian shared his script before](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/druid-dev/201805.mbox/browser) which is not completely configurable (for example, you have to fix the hard-corded user name in the script) and probably we can further generalize it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565257575/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565257925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9018#issuecomment-565257925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9018","id":565257925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTI1NzkyNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T01:11:51Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T01:12:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is probably a Calcite issue.
