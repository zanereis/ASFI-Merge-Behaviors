CouchDB simply adds a `deleted:true` leaf on the end of the path. If you request one of these documents with `?meta=true` I suspect you'll see a large block of `deleted_conflicts` entries.\r\n\r\nThe `_revs_limit` setting will cap the length of each individual path in the revision tree, and will then merge those shortened paths together into one or more trees. So, the number of entries in the `_revs_info` can be as high as the product of `_revs_limit` times the number of *total* paths -- deleted or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI would like to improve the behavior of the database so that it can intelligently \"prune\" the branches of the revision tree that track resolved conflicts once it's confident that all replication peers have observed the latest updates to the branch. It's a subtle change though with some important side effects to consider. We've also contemplated introducing user-defined conflict resolution strategies which could be more efficient than the current (maximally robust) strategy.\r\n\r\nCouchDB 1.x supported the notion of \"purging\" revisions entirely, which would certainly accomplish your goal of getting the revision metadata slimmed down. CouchDB 2.0 lost this capability because of some unique challenges supporting it in a cluster. We did recently re-introduce the capability in #1370 ... just after we released 2.2.0. It'll be in 2.3.0 once that's released.\r\n\r\nNet: there's not a lot you can do right now to fix up documents that had a lot of conflicts in the past. Shortening the `_revs_limit` does help -- but not as much as you think, and if it gets shortened too much you run the risk of generating additional spurious conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/431077350/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/431077438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1020#issuecomment-431077438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1020","id":431077438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTA3NzQzOA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-18T16:34:36Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T16:34:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@marklindsay24 the repository containing the script used to build the Mac app is here: https://github.com/janl/build-couchdb-mac\r\n\r\nMy guess is that you have to edit that Info.plist file as previously mentioned in this thread -

That is indeed configurable and default to 20. \r\n\r\nHowever, looking at the attached output it seems like you are noticing the `_local/<replication_id>` checkpoint document bodies. These are used to checkpoint replication progress on target and source. The bad news is that it is not configurable. The good news is it is hard-coded at 50: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch_replicator/src/couch_replicator_scheduler_job.erl#L782\r\n\r\nYou could try to reduce the frequency of checkpoints. Now it defaults to 30 sec. But you could make it a bit larger: http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/replicator.html#replicator/checkpoint_interval (notice the units are in milliseconds). The default used to be 5 sec ( = 5000) so check if you have that set explicitly in your config overriding the newer default. You'd still ship all 50 history entries on each checkpoint update and read after a while but, but you'd just do it less frequently (once / minute vs once / every seconds).

The bug fixed in this PR makes sure that `view_compact` requests go to the right queue. Database admin can influence which requests would have greater priority [see here](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-ioq/blob/master/src/ioq.erl#L139:L144).

CouchDB cookies are stateless, meaning we do not store the session information on the server *at all*. The 10 minute / 600 second setting is in `default.ini`, you can override it in `local.ini` with:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[couch_httpd_auth]\r\ntimeout = 3600 ; or whatever number of seconds you want\r\n```\r\n\r\nI presume your 750 iterations don't take the full 10 minutes?\r\n\r\nIf this is an actual bug we'll need your full configuration and test script to reproduce. Thank you for working to make that as minimal as possible! :handshake: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/435620768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/435649256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1711#issuecomment-435649256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1711","id":435649256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTY0OTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"kennsippell","id":9014751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTQ3NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9014751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell","html_url":"https://github.com/kennsippell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennsippell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-04T07:43:17Z","updated_at":"2018-11-04T07:43:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"User Error!
