I was speaking with @schnie from Astronomer.io last night and he mentioned a solution to the logging issue that they've implemented in their branch of the kubernetes executor. Basically because task-level logs don't get logged to the default log folder, k8s doesn't pick up those logs when you query the pod. To solve this, they have a side-car that reads the task log files to stdout. This should be somewhat straightforward to implement, though I'd rather @schnie PR it so he can get the credit :).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/386333283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/386391376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3309#issuecomment-386391376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3309","id":386391376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjM5MTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T18:24:51Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T18:25:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3309?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#3309](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3309?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/6f6884641f6eca799f35190ef133329a00a1daaf?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3309/graphs/tree.svg?token=WdLKlKHOAU&width=650&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3309?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #3309   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   75.88%   75.88%           \n=======================================\n  Files         197      197           \n  Lines       14712    14712           \n=======================================\n  Hits        11164    11164           \n  Misses       3548     3548\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3309?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Œî = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `√∏ = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3309?src=pr&el=footer).

I haven't looked into the issue. For the minikube version I've create a persistent disk that will share the log directory. So, the logs are available to the webserver and visible in Airflow.

We could also change this behaviour: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/bin/cli.py#L469","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/386409925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/386412967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3310#issuecomment-386412967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3310","id":386412967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjQxMjk2Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T19:41:32Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T19:41:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#3310](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/6f6884641f6eca799f35190ef133329a00a1daaf?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310/graphs/tree.svg?token=WdLKlKHOAU&src=pr&width=650&height=150)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #3310      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   75.88%   75.86%   -0.03%     \n==========================================\n  Files         197      197              \n  Lines       14712    14716       +4     \n==========================================\n  Hits        11164    11164              \n- Misses       3548     3552       +4\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Œî | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/www\\_rbac/views.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy93d3dfcmJhYy92aWV3cy5weQ==) | `72.11% <0%> (-0.27%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Œî = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `√∏ = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3310?src=pr&el=footer).

I took a second look in your code design and noticed the fact that all your mongo functions first need to call get_collection() which again calls get_conn(), creates a mongoClient, and then do some operations. \r\n\r\nCreating new MongoClient object multiple times could be very expensive if you need to use MongoHook to do some operations in few steps as each MongoClient is handling a separate connection pool. (Check here: http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/faq.html#how-does-connection-pooling-work-in-pymongo) \r\n\r\nIt would be better if you can reuse one MongoClient object in your methods (check if the Client object is already created) instead of calling get_conn() every time and then add a function to explicitly close the Client. \r\n\r\nAgain, please correct me if I am wrong about your design.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/386636747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/386651724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2923#issuecomment-386651724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2923","id":386651724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjY1MTcyNA==","user":{"login":"cloneluke","id":6568361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjgzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6568361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke","html_url":"https://github.com/cloneluke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloneluke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T16:18:27Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T16:18:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rebased
