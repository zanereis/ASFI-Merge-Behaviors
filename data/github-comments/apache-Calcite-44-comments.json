When a PR is under review, don't rebase (unless asked to), don't squash commits,  don't amend commits, just add new commits. It makes things easier for reviewers. We know how to do `git diff HEAD~5` if we need to.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful if you describe in brief a javadoc sentence the particular feature that each each test is testing. It's difficult to capture this in the test name - for example, the test case \"testGroupSetMultipleLiteralsOrder\" contains neither `GROUPING SET` nor `ORDER BY`. I understand from reading the test that you are interested in a query that contains literals and the literals are in a different order in the SELECT clause to the GROUP BY clause.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that this bug requires 70 lines of new tests, because the fix simply removes literals. Since all tests use the same MV, I would compress them all into one method.\r\n\r\nThe one case you have not tested is a query that groups by a literal and no columns, e.g. `GROUP BY 'a'`. The semantics are non-obvious when the table is empty. It warrants its own test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/923488887/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/923489356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2531#issuecomment-923489356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2531","id":923489356,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM43C1RM","user":{"login":"jacques-n","id":183350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n","html_url":"https://github.com/jacques-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-21T00:54:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T00:54:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I mentioned that because `ImmutableBeans` is part of the core, publicly accessible and was introduced a few releases ago in 1.22, so I am not sure anyone is relying on it (not sure they should).

The key difference is that you must use a builder if a property is marked as non-nullable and has no default (since you can't use a 'withFoo' operation until you have a fully valid pojo). When I did the change I was thinking that one or more of those properties were required and not yet default defined.
