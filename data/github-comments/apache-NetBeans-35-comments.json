thanks for the comment. This is (only) for Java, in case the classfiles for the dependencies are missing in the caches (for whatever reason, but more typically due to a bug somewhere), the Java parser will use the source files to create the model. But it currently processes the dependencies too deep, it should be enough to simply \"enter\" them (which finds which classes and methods are in the source files), not \"attribute\" them (which also analyses the method bodies and is much slower). Not sure how important is to backport this, I'd be fine with not backporting this and letting it settle in master for some time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/470411410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/470905637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1052#issuecomment-470905637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1052","id":470905637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDkwNTYzNw==","user":{"login":"rtaneja1","id":32299405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjk5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32299405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1","html_url":"https://github.com/rtaneja1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-08T12:02:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T12:02:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Installer build job for Linux and Windows installers:\r\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/netbeans-installer-test/\r\n\r\nNo option to select Mac host for building Mac OSX installer from Jenkins job.

you - I'll only comment on the license side of the import. I want an opinion from others more knowledgeable of the l10n part of the netbeans infrastructure, if the source code location is sensible and/or if we should open a separate repository of the the l10n data.\r\n\r\n- the procedure you described to verify, that only donated files were imported works (I had to rename my intermediate directory from the netbeans-l10n.zip, but that works ok). The first commit is ok from my POV.\r\n- the license change (second commit) is good to be separated, as it turns out, it is not complete:\r\n```shell\r\n# Get the files, that were imported (first commit)\r\ngit diff --name-only c6eb7aa76370f9a059736b686ba2b1f5f622e87c..328b07c6203fa2268c49bb0bd6b7c9d51636ddc4 | sort > imported.txt\r\n# Get the files, that had changes (this assumes, that the license header was updated) (second commit)\r\ngit diff --name-only 328b07c6203fa2268c49bb0bd6b7c9d51636ddc4..3fc7acd08836cc736d96c81fe53f3b6efaad2445 | sort > modfied.txt\r\n# both lists should match, as it is assumed, that all files carry the Oracle/Sun CDDL/GPLv2CP header and so output should be empty\r\ndiff imported.txt modfied.txt \r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the output of diff through diffstat reveals, that 6287 were not caught. My gut feeling tells me, that you missed the files, that Oracle inherited from Sun and never updated.\r\n- the change in the ignore file looks sane\r\n- the build change (last commit) looks ok, as we target JDK8 as minimum runtime JDK","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/474586340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/475054712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1167#issuecomment-475054712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1167","id":475054712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTA1NDcxMg==","user":{"login":"borisheithecker","id":17042929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17042929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker","html_url":"https://github.com/borisheithecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisheithecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-20T22:31:55Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T22:31:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I ran the convert tool from https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-tools to bulk replace the license headers.
