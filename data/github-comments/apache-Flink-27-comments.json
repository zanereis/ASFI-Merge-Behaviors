I will push my latest version for this tomorrow. \n\nRegarding the suggestion that the Vertex class might not be the best place for the getDegree methods, there is a reason why implementing this took a while ^^. I wanted to make the degrees available only in the iteration. The problem is that with the current code(this one and the one in \"production\"), a vertex is only accessible in the updateVertex() method. This means that there is no way to get the vertex within the iteration, you don't have a Vertex object, it's not something you send to the class. That was the quick workaround I found for this issue. If you know a better way, I am eager to hear your suggestions. \n\nThanks! :) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94915061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/94916699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/609#issuecomment-94916699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/609","id":94916699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0OTE2Njk5","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-21T19:44:33Z","updated_at":"2015-04-21T19:44:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Forwarding comments from JIRA:\n\nI think @DarkKnightCZ is using versiob 0.8.x and Till Rohrmann is talking about 0.9\nThe startup is handled very differently in 0.9 and should actually fix the issue.

The code would just need to loop through all fields that have _KEY at the end, and then find the matching default value without the _KEY at the end. From the default value field the type of the value can be determined and it can be added to the appropriate hash map.

A REST style backend that produces JSON structures with the information rendered by the frontend (lists of states, timestamps, names, counters, ...). \n2. An angular.js based frontend, that is still much work in progress (someone else is helping me out there)\n\nYou can have a look at (1) here \"https://github.com/StephanEwen/incubator-flink/commits/web_frontend_2\" It supports queries for example like \"http://localhost:8082/running/<jobid>/vertices\" to get the vertex statuses for all vertices of a job. The nice thing is that it is extremely lightweight, by being a minimal layer on top of netty (which we use for data transport anyways). Before, I was trying to go for jersey/grizzly, but these are heavyweight (25+ dependencies) there were many version conflicts with other dependencies (like YARN).\n\nI hope to be able to share a few screenshots for (2) on the mailing list next week.\n\nHow much have you implemented on your side?

Let's leave it like this for now.\nOnly small thing that maybe I didn't explain well, is \"operate directly on the values\" for the combinable versions. I meant there's no need to pass the vertex keys at all.\nThis is a small change, I can make it before merging.\nOtherwise, everything looks good, I'll merge right after #408.

A few thoughts on this:\n\nYour prior discussion involved efficiency, and Vasia suggested to not carry the degrees in all cases (as they are not needed in most cases). It seems that was not yet realized, because the Vertex class always carries the degrees.\n\nI think we can improve the abstraction between the with-degree and without-degree case a bit. Cases where one has to throw a \"not supported\" can usually be improved with a good inheritance hierarchy. Does it work to make the VertexWithDegrees class a subclass of the Vertex class?\n\nAlso, as a bit of background: Vertex is a subclass of \"Tuple2\". Tuples are currently the fastest data types in Flink. By adding additional Fields to the Tuple, you are making it a POJO (as far as I know), which is a bit slower to serialize type.\n\nAlso: primitives are usually better than boxed types. Prefer `long` over `Long` where possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/96558324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/96562609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/623#issuecomment-96562609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/623","id":96562609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2NTYyNjA5","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-27T08:33:07Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T08:33:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are definitely welcome to participate in the new web frontend development.
