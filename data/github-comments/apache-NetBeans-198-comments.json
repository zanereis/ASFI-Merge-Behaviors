gut feeling is, that the HtmlHintsProvider and the expectations of the CslTestBase/GsfHintsManager don't match. It seems suggestions were never really supported. It might be worthy looking into JS/CSS whether there are suggestions being checked. I'm not sure, that modifying CslTestBase is really a good idea.\r\n\r\nGeneral comments:\r\n\r\n1. The unstable test you observed is because you dispatch the text change into another thread (`org.netbeans.modules.html.editor.hints.other.AddMissingAltAttributeHint.AddMissingAltAttributeHintFix.implement()`. That (a) makes it unstable and is IMHO wrong. I suggest to adjust to this:\r\n    ```java\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void implement() throws Exception {\r\n            BaseDocument document = (BaseDocument) context.getSnapshot().getSource().getDocument(true);\r\n            document.runAtomic(() -> {\r\n                try {\r\n                    OffsetRange adjustedRange = HtmlTagContextUtils.adjustContextRange(document, range.getStart(), range.getEnd(), true);\r\n                    String tagContent = document.getText(adjustedRange.getStart(), adjustedRange.getLength());\r\n\r\n                    // Find last self-closing or non self-closing tag\r\n                    Pattern closingTagPattern = Pattern.compile(\"(/?>)\");\r\n                    Matcher closingTagMatcher = closingTagPattern.matcher(tagContent);\r\n\r\n                    if (closingTagMatcher.find()) {\r\n                        int altInsertPosition = adjustedRange.getStart() + closingTagMatcher.start(1);\r\n\r\n                        // Check whether a space before alt is needed or not\r\n                        boolean needsSpaceBefore = altInsertPosition == 0 || tagContent.charAt(closingTagMatcher.start(1) - 1) != ' ';\r\n                        boolean isSelfClosing = closingTagMatcher.group(0).endsWith(\"/>\");\r\n                        String altAttribute = (needsSpaceBefore ? \" \" : \"\") + \"alt=\\\"\\\"\" + (isSelfClosing ? \" \" : \"\"); // NOI18N\r\n\r\n                        document.insertString(altInsertPosition, altAttribute, null);\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch (BadLocationException ex) {\r\n                    // Ignore\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    ```\r\n    There is no need to do this on the EDT. The locking infrastructure of the documents should handle this.\r\n\r\n2. The `null` check in `CslTestBase#findApplicableFix` begins to make sense, when you write it like this: \r\n\r\n    ![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/2179736/38711d1e-8dcf-40ae-a42f-33a2cd7597b8)\r\n\r\n    The only difference compared to master is in line 4603, 4621 is only modified when comparing with your version.\r\n\r\n    Then `org.netbeans.modules.csl.api.test.CslTestBase.applyHint(NbTestCase, Rule, String, String, String)` can be called with `null` as final parameter, which would invoke the found fix without checking for the description.\r\n\r\n3. Merges make it hard to compare against the base revision. Until this is changed incrementally/being reviewed I suggest to either not merge master or use rebases to cleanup/update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1927895147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1927904097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7019#issuecomment-1927904097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7019","id":1927904097,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5y6Xth","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-05T19:38:27Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T19:38:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"going to squash soon and make this ready to merge.

I'm definitely with you, I will check the JS stuff, because CSS has also no real hints/fixes (just basic stuff) as I have. I also thought that this was never tried before. Lemme check more what I can do.\r\n\r\nFor the invokeLater, thx for the hint with the change, I got this from ExtractInlinedStyleHint but due to I not doing extrem things like opening a new UI, it is not needed here.

Start the IDE.\r\n2. Copy text from the NetBeans editor and paste into Notepad++ (this works on the first attempt).\r\n3. Attempt to copy text from the NetBeans editor a second time and paste into Notepad++ (this does not work).\r\n4. Copying text from Notepad++ and pasting it back into NetBeans results in the text copied in step 2 being pasted.\r\n5. Copying text within NetBeans and pasting it within NetBeans works. After completing this step, copying and pasting to Notepad++ also works.\r\n\r\n## Observation\r\n\r\nIt appears that when copying text from NetBeans, the action is cached and awaits pasting into the NetBeans editor. Until the copied text is pasted back into NetBeans, further copy-paste actions are blocked. However, copying from Notepad++ to NetBeans does not exhibit this problem, suggesting an issue with how NetBeans handles the system clipboard.\r\n\r\n## Solution and Investigation\r\n\r\nUpon examining the source code, I located a potential cause within the clipboard handling mechanism mentioned in \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1233619736\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (System.getProperty(\"netbeans.slow.system.clipboard.hack\") != null) { // NOI18N\r\n    slowSystemClipboard = Boolean.getBoolean(\"netbeans.slow.system.clipboard.hack\"); // NOI18N\r\n} else if (Utilities.isMac()) {\r\n    slowSystemClipboard = false;\r\n} else {\r\n    slowSystemClipboard = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe property `netbeans.slow.system.clipboard.hack` was set to `false` in `netbeans.conf`, which resolved the issue. This modification skips the problematic clipboard behavior, avoiding the addition of AWT event listeners for clipboard management when `slowSystemClipboard` is false:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (slowSystemClipboard) {\r\n    Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().addAWTEventListener(\r\n        this, AWTEvent.WINDOW_EVENT_MASK);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter applying this change, NetBeans directly accesses items from the system clipboard without interference.\r\n\r\n## Configuration Applied\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\nnetbeans_default_options=\"-J-Dnetbeans.slow.system.clipboard.hack=false [...]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis adjustment effectively bypasses the issue, suggesting a workaround by modifying the clipboard handling behavior in NetBeans.\r\n\r\nShould the issue reoccur, I will provide further updates. However, after multiple resets of the IDE following this adjustment, the problem has not been reproduced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1935066154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1935243692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1935243692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1935243692,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5zWXms","user":{"login":"pborissow","id":10224874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI0ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10224874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow","html_url":"https://github.com/pborissow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pborissow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-09T02:27:06Z","updated_at":"2024-04-13T12:36:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Very encouraging!
