for sharing this with me @ascott! From a legibility perspective, I think 45° works better than 90° here. However, the shrinking of the graph is an issue. If I had to trade off I would keep the labels 45° and allow the graph to be pushed in. One way I've seen this solved (sort of) in the past is to truncate long labels from the middle or end that are rotated 45°. For example: 1985-01-01 00:00:00 is 1985...00:00. On hover the entire label could be shown. This could also be a toggle to turn them on and off.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/276167433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/276200005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2056#issuecomment-276200005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2056","id":276200005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjIwMDAwNQ==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-30T21:40:23Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T21:40:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Indeed,

I'm need to package this as its own module, but this does work.  Simply install pydrill then copy the contents of this archive into `<python-path>/site-packages/pydrill/` directory.  My intent is to submit a PR for PyDrill to get the DBAPI incorporated into that module, but I have to write up unit tests and test it on all the various python versions so that might take a while. \r\n\r\nOnce you have this, then install this: https://github.com/cgivre/sqlalchemy-drill/tree/pydrill using `python setup.py install -- force` and you'll be able to connect Superset and Drill. \r\n\r\n[dbapi.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/superset/files/742547/dbapi.zip)\r\n\r\nWith all that said, the dialect and the DBAPI do work and I've been able to successfully create some charts and graphs with them.  I haven't been able to get any of the timeseries visualizations to work, and I'm not quite sure why yet.  I've also been able to execute arbitrary SQL statements via SQL Lab but I do run into issues when I try to visualize these statements. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that when SQLAlchemy generates the new table it does so as follows:\r\nSELECT field1, field2\r\nFROM \r\n(SELECT field1, field2 \r\nFROM table 1\r\n) AS table1___\r\n\r\nWhen using Joins and subqueries, Drill requires all fields to have table names and thus it throws an error.  Also SQLAlchemy seems to generate queries that use column aliases in GROUP BY clauses which also causes problems with Drill. \r\n\r\nI'll go through all the visualizations and write up what works and what doesn't so that others can take a look as well.
