I see that the commit has caught some error https://github.com/apache/phoenix/blob/4.x-HBase-1.3/docs/phoenix.csv which was not there earlier https://github.com/apache/phoenix/blob/4.x-HBase-1.2/docs/phoenix.csv.  Could you please fix it? It should be something simple of removing an unwanted quote etc. \r\nThank you.

Really, they should be their own PTableType, but because the enum's used on both client and server side, adding an enum value would be really tricky. \r\n\r\nThis is also why this small change caused a good number of test failures.
