SPI, the user can specify the registration center method and specific related parameters in the configuration file. Zookeeper is used by default\r\n\r\ntodo list:\r\n- [x] 1 : Provide a unified registry Client related interface (org.apache.dolphinscheduler.spi.registry), @hermeshephaestus \r\n\r\nIncluding registration, offline, update and other operations. The external access registration center uniformly calls the Client interface.\r\nThe registration center currently only provides a single registration center. We need to load the corresponding plug-in according to the user configuration. When the user does not specify it, zookeeper is used by default.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in order to transition, we need to provide the implementation of distributed locks. (This is just for transition)\r\n\r\n- [x] 2: Regarding the implementation of ZK in the registration center.  @AhahaGe\r\n\r\n- [x] 3:Alert Server supports the registration center. The alert server must share the same registry with the worker master, and multiple registries are not currently supported.  @zhuangchong \r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] 4: Implementation of Etcd in the registry @CalvinKirs \r\n\r\nTo realize this function, you need to vote for the related jars by mail. I have checked the related dependencies and they are all within the acceptable range of ASF.\r\n\r\n注册中心SPI，用户可在配置文件指定注册中心的方式，以及具体的相关参数。默认使用Zookeeper\r\n\r\n1：提供统一的注册中心Client相关接口(org.apache.dolphinscheduler.spi.registry)，\r\n\r\n包含注册、下线、更新等操作。外部访问注册中心统一调用该Client接口。\r\n注册中心目前只提供单注册中心，我们需要按照用户配置来加载相应的插件，当用户未指定，则默认使用zookeeper。\r\n\r\n同时，为了过渡，我们需要提供分布式锁的实现。（这仅仅是为了过渡）\r\n\r\n2:注册中心关于ZK的实现。\r\n\r\n3:Alert Server支持注册中心。alert server 必须和worker master共用一个注册中心，暂不支持多注册中心。\r\n\r\n\r\n3:注册中心关于Etcd的实现\r\n该功能实现需要首先将相关依赖的jar进行邮件投票。我检查过相关依赖，都属ASF可以接受的范围。\r\n\r\n具体任务需要出具体的设计，当前只是粗略的任务清单。\r\n\r\nYou can refer to the

单独修改字段对新老任务都没有效果\r\n2.quartz.properties文件中的instanceName参数要和1.X配置一致，否则quartz会创建新实例，之前版本创建的工作流都不会被调度\r\n3.修复完改bug后新建定时任务没问题但是老任务报错\r\n[ERROR] 2020-11-04 15:32:45.097 org.apache.dolphinscheduler.server.master.consumer.TaskPriorityQueueConsumer:[148] - dispatch error\r\norg.apache.dolphinscheduler.server.master.dispatch.exceptions.ExecuteException: fail to execute :

execute\r\n通过查询配置文件发现1.3.2的conf/worker.properties下worker.groups=localhost\r\n排查问题过程中突然不管新老任务都开始报上述错误\r\n将worker.groups=localhost修改为default    任务又报错current task need to localhost worker group execute\r\n目前还未定位到问题
