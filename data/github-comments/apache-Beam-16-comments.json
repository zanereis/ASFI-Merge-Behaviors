should more fully state what I mean here: I agree with the change to the `InProcessRunner` temporarily, but also believe there is a bug in checkpoint finalization that this change will mask.\n\nLonger term, the direct runner should do all of these:\n1. Reuse the reader\n2. Grab a checkpoint, finalize it, and use it to get a new reader\n3. Grab a checkpoint, finalize it, serialize/deserialize, and use it to get a new reader\n\nIf we temporarily have to choose between 2 and 3, then 3 is better. It exercises the important deserialization code path. If deserialization is correct, then any divergence between 2 and 3 is a bug in the source, and missing those bugs is just the short-term cost of switching to 3.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/221680415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/221684980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/382#issuecomment-221684980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/382","id":221684980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTY4NDk4MA==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T19:43:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T19:43:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Good point @kennknowles let me re-enable javadoc.
