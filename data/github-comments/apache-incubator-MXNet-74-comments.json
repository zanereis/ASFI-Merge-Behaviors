Discussion\n\nThis is an interesting topic to discuss, and related to what @mavenlin and I discussed a while ago. Think about efficiency in executions, there are three causes:\n- The memory latency and total save load cost of kernel\n- The cost of kernel launching between consecutive kernel calls\n- The cost of the kernel itself.\n\nCurrently mxnet parallelizes the workload within single card, which meas it can likely hide the kernel launching problem by a bit. But in our experience, it is likely to be around 25% gain. There are several potential cause here:\n- The scheduler is not yet very optimized so there is still gap between kernel launching(likely to see gaps between kernel executions)\n- The kernel is optimized for quickly execution and occupy all resources, but when there are small kernels, they still occupy all resources to prevent other workload to occupy GPU\n- The fused kernel reduces memory fetchs and increases speed overall\n\n# Directions\n\nOnly the last direction will involve a NTC or specially optimized code. But I do think there might still be something to gain by simply sharing workloads and possibly using customized kernels that aimed to take partial resources. It is very interesting to see if it is possible to do so without loss of flexiblity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/221020499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/221027575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2194#issuecomment-221027575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2194","id":221027575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTAyNzU3NQ==","user":{"login":"junranhe","id":12316898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzE2ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12316898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe","html_url":"https://github.com/junranhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junranhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-23T16:44:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-23T16:44:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"well,

It could be helpful to also see the same graph when this value is set to 3. \n\nI think the following parts are optimizable.\n\n## Multistream execution\n\nThe current engine would not determine which stream to use based on the dependency. The streams are used in a pulling way, whichever finishes first will pull the next kernel for execution. Therefore it is not guaranteed that the red blocks would be in different streams. But the work load would be balanced in this way.\n\nIn the multiple branch case, the efficiency of the engine can be further improved when the streams are used based on the dependency. For example, kernel that depends on other kernels should be scheduled to any of the streams of its depending kernels. A stream can be dynamically allocated(or get from the pool) when there is a bifurcation, and send back to the pool for reuse when the bifurcation merges back. \n\nAs @tqchen mentioned, whether paralleling with stream is beneficial is also decided by the resources that the kernel uses. In most of the cases, there is space for improvement because the resources are not used up. In the case each kernel is optimized to use all the resources it might even hamper the performance (but also depends on how well NV people have optimized the context switching of streams).\n\n## Gap between Kernel Launch\n\nFrom the profiling result, I believe this is the major cause of the bad performance. Because the gaps are as long as if not longer than the kernels. This is caused by the current scheduling method of the engine. Although cuda provides an asynchronous interface, current engine is not using it. Instead, after a kernel is launched the engine will immediately call cudaStreamSynchronize. It is until the current kernel is finished, the callback function will launch the next one.\n\n> User -(async)-> Engine -(sync)-> Cuda\n\n## Prescheduling the kernels\n\nCombining the above two points, a prescheduling engine can be developed.\n- By prescheduling, the gap between kernel launches can be hidden because engine to cuda is now async.\n\n> User -(async)-> Engine -(async)-> Cuda\n- This is also beneficial for embeded torch module (or other functions in script but calls cuda), because as long as the last step is async, we can preserve the performance.\n\n> User -(async)-> Engine -(sync)-> Lua -(async)-> Cuda\n- Streams are balanced when they actively **pulls** from a task queue, it is hard to achieve this balance when we do prescheduling which means **pushing**.

Actually the image data, labels and weights contain 60000 entries (or rows). And for both the iters, I set the batch size as the same. So I don't think it's due to the different length issue. But after debugging, I found that in my customized iterator, when `iters[0]` (i.e., `ImageRecordIter` for images and labels) becomes `None`, `iters[1]` (i.e., `CSVIter` for weights) is not.

@tqchen Thanks for your replies. i tried both your suggestions and the issue remains. I found that if I use another gpu with 6 GB memory, there is no out of memory because the maximum gpu memory usage is about 4.2 GB, which is sufficient for this card but not for my previous one. What is interesting is that why it takes so much memory to reshape if the new executor shares the memory with the old one? \nIf I change the shape to a fixed one instead of random one like this:\n\n```\ntemp_shape = (1,3, 700,700)\n```\n\nthere is no problem, even without wait_to_read or copyto. The memory usage is only 180 MB. I guess there should be some extra memory usage during the allocation of the new shaped arguments, but 180 MB compared with 4.2 GB seems a little big difference. \nThis only happens when I frequently change the input size. Any help would be really appreciated. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/221464638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/221466979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2232#issuecomment-221466979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2232","id":221466979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTQ2Njk3OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T03:56:15Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T03:56:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"try to avoid allow_up_sizing and always allocate the largest executor\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/221466979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
