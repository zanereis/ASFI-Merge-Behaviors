We really needed this. I do think that we should try to figure out how all the test/deploy stuff gets settled before merging though. I suggest we further wait for #416 to merge to master so that you can rebase this branch. Then I can work with you to tweak the pom.xml from there based on whatever is settled on for test/deploy issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/247119906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/247127687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/415#issuecomment-247127687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/415","id":247127687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzEyNzY4Nw==","user":{"login":"davebshow","id":3734233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzQyMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3734233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow","html_url":"https://github.com/davebshow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebshow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T19:31:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T19:31:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maintaining compatibility should be pretty simple, but as you can see from the PR, there are little things that can go wrong. I think the main issue we will run into with this library is numeric typing, and I think we are well on our way to dealing with it.\n\nRegarding the mvn build, I think we can just have it run against the default Python installation for now, which is a bit more risky, but we can mitigate the risk by running CI builds for multiple versions of Python. I also like to test locally, I just spin up a server manually and run `python setup.py test` against multiple versions of Python. This kind of multiple environment testing is made easier using the tool `tox`, maybe we could look at adding this as a requirement.\n\nThis shouldn't affect the deployment process at all.

Wow -- `where().by()` is super powerful. That nested `where(select())`-clause you had in there was naaaasty. \n\nGiven how much easier some things are to express, I'm realizing that people will be wanting to use `where().by()`  more often than not and given that `where().by()` is a `PathProcessor` now, OLAP will not allow any `by()` beyond the element id! Eek. No fear, we have `PathProcessorStrategy` that knows how to \"flatten\" `select().by()` accordingly. With that, I think another ticket should provide two things:\n1. `PathProcessorStrategy` should be updated to support `where().by()` flattening.\n2. Create a new strategy called `WhereByMatchStrategy` which turns `where().by()` patterns into `match()`-steps. (@dkuppitz's idea)\n\nNow, if (1) above happens then (2) above won't do anything. Why would (1) happen, but not (2). The complexity of the `where()`-step's `by()`-clause. If the `by()` clause is within the bounds of the local star graph, then (1) will trigger. Else, it won't and (2) would trigger.  Next, we will have to see how these two strategies interact with `MatchPredicateStrategy` as this folds `where()`-clauses into `match()` to get the runtime optimizer benefits... Its all very complex :D \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/247306316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/247307770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/419#issuecomment-247307770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/419","id":247307770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzMwNzc3MA==","user":{"login":"HoekstraMk","id":2787160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODcxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2787160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk","html_url":"https://github.com/HoekstraMk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoekstraMk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T11:54:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T11:54:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the inconvenience.

Those two really stink compared to hamcrest and `assertThat(something(), is(true))` or `assertThat(something(), is(false))` because they print better output than the former that makes it easier to immediately see the problem with the assertion on failure. I convert those `assertTrue` and `assertFalse` as I see opportunity to do so. I also use hamcrest when the assertion logic is complex and there is a better simple one liner operation with hamcrest that makes the assertion more readable with a cleaner output message than junit.  So, no, I don't think we have to prefer Hamcrest to Junit across the board, but we should consider it when it produces a more readable output or more readable code.

can't wait to start using this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/248268702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/248361977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/425#issuecomment-248361977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/425","id":248361977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODM2MTk3Nw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T16:52:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T16:52:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"good: \"all `has()` method overloads behave like before\"\n\nAll tests pass with `docker/build.sh -t -n -i`\n\nVOTE +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/248361977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/248745278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/431#issuecomment-248745278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/431","id":248745278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODc0NTI3OA==","user":{"login":"twilmes","id":4722637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjI2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4722637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes","html_url":"https://github.com/twilmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T21:15:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T21:15:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking good.  \n\nVOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/248745278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/248746008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/431#issuecomment-248746008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/431","id":248746008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODc0NjAwOA==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T21:18:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T21:18:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1.

I don't know if the one @dkuppitz created, referenced in TINKERPOP-980 , is still viable. But I can't test. Any volunteers?\n\nI would have to say that it's not customary for systemd/upstart templates to be in `bin/`.  They're really not binaries, more like configuration for those apps. Maybe create an `extras/` dir?\n\nThe initd script is a real, executable script with `start, stop, status`.  I didn't want to modify `gremlin-server.sh` since it has some functionality over a pure init script like install deps, run in foreground, pass conf file.  However, it also has its short-comings like it can only be run in the install dir.  The initd script can be run from anywhere and also can be directly referenced from initd.  That said, it's not unusual for the main server script to also be the initd script.\n\nMy preference would be to merge the two. But there _should_ be a breaking change in that executing `gremlin-server.sh` would show help instead of running in the foreground.  Would probably add a new option to run in foreground, `start -f`.   Passing a conf file can still work, with or without start. `-i` can still work. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/250244312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/250246282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/439#issuecomment-250246282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/439","id":250246282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDI0NjI4Mg==","user":{"login":"robertdale","id":122206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T17:57:49Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T17:57:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe if the script detects that it's called via link with no parameters, then it's in initd mode and displays help.
