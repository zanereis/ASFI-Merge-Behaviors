Later on, once CI stable, we can change the docker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/721515008/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/721531822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6823#issuecomment-721531822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6823","id":721531822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTUzMTgyMg==","user":{"login":"ANSHUMAN87","id":32511895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTExODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32511895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87","html_url":"https://github.com/ANSHUMAN87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T06:08:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T06:08:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also cc @MarisaKirisame !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/721531822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/721582119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6830#issuecomment-721582119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6830","id":721582119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMTU4MjExOQ==","user":{"login":"jcf94","id":12119698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE5Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12119698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94","html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-04T08:18:30Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T08:22:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This problem can be reproduced in my local runtime with ci-i386 docker.\r\n\r\nSeems the float point operations under 32bit environment trends to be less accurate than 64bit?\r\n\r\nI've tried more tests on different llvm versions, codegen results with higher llvm version can still encounter accuracy problem, but with lower possibility.

I know monorepo'ing everything provides some conveniences but when there are reusable components which can be used outside of TVM it makes sense to maintain them as separate pieces of code. For example there have been multiple other projects which have built similar approaches to `synr` and I think it is valuable to provide it in an easily reusable component, for example TensorFlow and PyTorch have both opt'd not to do this and even though they do AST rewriting there is no easy way to take advantage of all the work they did.

@joyalbin ,\r\nSo Arm Compute Library is a runtime library, and it is meant to run on Arm machines. The usual setup is the following:\r\n- A: is the machine where you are actually compiling your network. Which is usually a x86 machine. \r\n- B: is the machine where you run the network (e.g., through RPC). This should be an Arm machine. \r\n\r\nAbout the flags:\r\n- On machine A, you need build TVM with USE_ARM_COMPUTE_LIB  to ON. In that way you tell the (Relay) compiler  to annotate the Arm Compute LIbrary supported operators. On machine A USE_ARM_COMPUTE_LIB_GRAPH_RUNTIME has to be set to OFF. This is because that machine won't be able to build Arm Compute Library, being an x86 machine. \r\n\r\n- On machine B , you need to only build the runtime with  USE_ARM_COMPUTE_LIB_GRAPH_RUNTIME to ON. This is telling the runtime that whenever it sees an annotated operator, it should run it through the Arm Compute Library. Just to be clear, on machine B, you usually build only the runtime part of TVM (i.e., `make -j4 runtime`)\r\n\r\nSome more info about all this: \r\n- https://tvm.apache.org/2020/07/15/how-to-bring-your-own-codegen-to-tvm\r\n- https://tvm.apache.org/docs/deploy/arm_compute_lib.html?highlight=acl\r\n- https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-byoc-arm-compute-library-integration/7082\r\n\r\nHope this helps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723035016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723073705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6861#issuecomment-723073705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6861","id":723073705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzA3MzcwNQ==","user":{"login":"lhutton1","id":35535092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTM1MDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35535092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1","html_url":"https://github.com/lhutton1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhutton1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T13:12:38Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T13:12:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the update @siju-samuel ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723073705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723076881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6823#issuecomment-723076881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6823","id":723076881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzA3Njg4MQ==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T13:19:56Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T13:19:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In terms of why I need this, I want to do some pattern matching on loops to determine if they correspond to a particular operation.

The entire Relay AST has had spans for the entire existence of the IR, this change is a follow-on from UnifiedIR refactors where we make things more consistent. \r\n\r\nThe span design originates (or Location) style of diagnostics is the style adopted by many modern compilers including Rust, and MLIR. The reason to have spans directly on the AST is the same reason to have type information they are important fields and having them be \"intrinsic\" vs. \"extrinsic\" properties. \r\n\r\nIn my exp. working on compilers having things exist in global stateful maps which must be kept in sync introduces complexity as the global state must be passed everywhere and you have to be very careful at which time you read from the maps. For example propagating span information inside of a pass which builds new AST fragments is easy as you can directly build span information from existing spans.\r\n\r\nIf we want to attach more meta-data for diagnostics I think we should attach that information to the diagnostic objects instead of attaching them to the spans/ast nodes directly. The diagnostics correspond to a location where some information was generated and the spans are indexes into the source representation. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723230910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/723235173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6860#issuecomment-723235173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6860","id":723235173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzIzNTE3Mw==","user":{"login":"giuseros","id":2017147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTcxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros","html_url":"https://github.com/giuseros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T18:34:11Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T18:59:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @jroesch , \r\nThanks for the detailed explanation!
