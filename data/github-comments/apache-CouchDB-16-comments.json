would like to suggest a bit different way, again a bit complicated, but with more potential in future. We eventually have a https://github.com/apache/couchdb-erlang-tests repository which is eventually empty. I planned to use it exactly for the purpose you propose here: all the common helpers, patterns,  abstract common things that helps to keep our tests more specific on what they doing and not pollute you editor space with implementation specifics, especially when they get repeated all the time (recall how we test chttpd resources...).\n\nSuddenly, my work on that idea stopped right there because lack of time and great ideas decomposition done right. But I would be happy if you take this flag while it left all alone.\n\nI still think that this would be better way to go, because we actually shouldn't keep too much logic in here with our current design whatever we think about it. Also, if one day we'll try to make each app to be tested in standalone mode, we wouldn't have to take this big repo into the dependencies, but use another one, more specific and his goals.\n\nSound good for you?

Anyway, that's not what users nor package maintainers would expect from `make install` and definitely the behaviour must follow the common guidelines.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/210558613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/210565019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/402#issuecomment-210565019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/402","id":210565019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDU2NTAxOQ==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T17:56:27Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T17:56:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kxepal yeah, like I said, naming is TBD, what should we make this? :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/210565019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/210565097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/402#issuecomment-210565097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/402","id":210565097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDU2NTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T17:56:46Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T17:56:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@garrensmith @robertkowalski ignore me, I missed an update on `master`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/210565097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/210566436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/402#issuecomment-210566436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/402","id":210566436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDU2NjQzNg==","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T18:01:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T18:01:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ah, I didn't read the message carefully.
