This null object in turn was being used by thrift library class and threw a null pointer exception. Both the classes where exception was thrown and caught were logging this exception, creating unnecessary lengthy log statements. Disabling logging in storm code by changing it from error to debug took care of one part but to work around the issue of exception being logged in the thrift jar a NoOpTTrasport.java had to be created. Two main things to consider during review<br/>\n    1. Change from Logger.error to Logger.debug in KerberosSaslTransportPlugin.java<br/>\n    2. Early return false in SaslTransportPlugin.java which is presumed and tested with one nimbus client to work okay. </p>\n\n<p>    Note: TProcess interface process method does not have documentation saying what the returned boolean indicates. </p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/priyank5485/storm\"
