Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\ndocs link: https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/zh-cn/docs/2.0.1/user_doc/guide/installation/pseudo-cluster.html\r\nIn the 2.0.1 pseudo-cluster deployment document, there are the following problems：\r\n\r\n1. The `chown -R` operation mentioned in the following steps, the document did not mention where `dolphinscheduler-bin` was created or generated before this，Not friendly here\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56599784/148323864-25d37fbb-76db-4e67-b6c5-aab8c7114618.png)\r\n\r\n2.

Before starting the service, it is best to add the `su dolphinscheduler` operation prompt to prevent starting operations under non-deployment users\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56599784/148327313-cdafc765-3841-470a-b0b1-480b5c3bc498.png)\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nSee \"what happend\"\n\n### How to

@lenboo Encountered a problem during the modification process：\r\ncase:\r\nWhen user A authorizes resource file a to user B, is user B allowed to authorize file a to user C?\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to not allow user B to re-authorize the files authorized by user A, authorization only allows first-level authorization.\r\nWhat is your opinion?\r\n\r\n---\r\n我的建议是不允许用户B将用户A授权的文件再次进行授权，授权只允许一级授权。否则会产生额外的问题，如循环授权，多层级授权导致文件不可控等","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1006560869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1006592428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/7837#issuecomment-1006592428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/7837","id":1006592428,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms47_2Gs","user":{"login":"aaronlinv","id":11210385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjEwMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11210385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlinv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlinv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-06T13:28:04Z","updated_at":"2022-01-06T13:28:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@caishunfeng

task A fail and run `WorkflowExecuteThread.taskFinished`, it will add retry task into standby queue, which will submit by `WorkflowExecuteThread.submitPostNode` and `StateWheelExecuteThread.checkTask4Retry`;  When I add sleep 30s in `submitTaskInstanceToDB` like Figure 4, it will increase the probability of repeated retries. In this way, retry task A in standby list will be submit by `WorkflowExecuteThread.submitPostNode` because run task c, and then, `StateWheelExecuteThread.checkTask4Retry` add it into standby list and submit again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1006691975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
