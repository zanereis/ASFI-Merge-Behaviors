But on second thought, the solution provided in the PR look a bit off to me. \r\n\r\nTo my understanding, the problem occurs due to the existence of a cached `exc_text` attribute contained inside the `LogRecord` object which `.format()` set during the interception.  \r\n\r\nThe following is from the Python logging module, as we can see the cache is done by this chunk of code. The bug occurs because SkyWalking agent did not clear the cache after doing the formatting, therefore, other formatters would just reuse the cached exception, essentially bypassing the arguments.\r\n```\r\n    if record.exc_info:\r\n        # Cache the traceback text to avoid converting it multiple times\r\n        # (it's constant anyway)\r\n        if not record.exc_text:\r\n            record.exc_text = self.formatException(record.exc_info)\r\n```\r\nNow, if we simply switch the lines around by executing the user's handler first and then format by SkyWalking agent, it seems to me that it would cause the same issue (but reversed - UI shows whatever exception format that user handler.formatter uses). Instead, we could just reset the LogRecord.exc_text to None as the doc suggests.\r\nI will send another PR to address the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1072929993/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1072942859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/8698#issuecomment-1072942859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/8698","id":1072942859,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls84_888L","user":{"login":"Superskyyy","id":26076517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDc2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26076517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/Superskyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Superskyyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-19T05:10:16Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T05:10:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26076517/159106676-54934f8b-e1a2-4064-9474-13ef828a910d.png)\r\n@katelei6 Hello, thanks for reporting the issue, actually the current limitation was noted in the code and `plugins.md` documentation. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, please try using the HTTP protocol and things should be working.\r\n\r\nnote = \"\"\"The celery server running with \"celery -A ...\" should be run with the HTTP protocol\r\nas it uses multiprocessing by default which is not compatible with the gRPC protocol implementation\r\nin SkyWalking currently.
