However, the automatic estimation won't work for multiple record files, i.e. train.rec won't know how much to pad in val.rec, thus you have to set the label_pad_width manually. I know it is awkward, but synchronize the width between train_iterator and val_iterator will force them to reload again, which is not a good option neither. \r\n\r\nThere will be a update on the data loading module for object detection tasks, so please bare with the current API for now.

tested with cuDNN 6 when using JetPack 3.1 on TX2. Profiling of resnet_fp16.py shows that true FP16 cuda kernels are called (*_hcudnn_*) and no more *_fp16_* calls. Following findings have been made while profiling resnet_fp16.py with number layers = 18 and with batch size 8:\r\n- FP16 convolutional kernels are 1.3-1.8x faster compared to FP32\r\n- FP16 batch normalization kernels are 1.2-1.4x faster compared to FP32\r\n- FP16 activation (RELU) kernels are also 1.2-1.4x faster compared to FP32\r\n- overall cost of casting FP32 to FP16 is only 2% of the total run-time\r\nIs that to be expected?\r\nProfiler output is here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwb8o6lldJgBSUh0U2NEZXVvRW8\r\nOverall, I observe 1.5x speed-up due to FP16 for batch size of 8 and input image resolution of 640x480, and increasing batch results into the similar speed-ups of 1.5x.\r\nI have a few questions:\r\n- reducing batch size to 4 and 1 shows much smaller gains of 1.2x and 1.1x due to FP16, respectively. Is that to be expected? Presumably this is due to the overhead of copying the data to/from GPU.\r\n- keeping batch size = 8, but reducing by 2x the number of filters per layer shows a speed-up FP16 vs. FP32 of only 1.3x. Why is that?\r\n-  reducing input image resolution to 0.7*original resolution does not affect significantly the gains due to FP16 for different batch sizes, compared to using original resolution\r\n- when profiling my custom FP16 ResNet-18 that has dilated convolutions, I see pseudo-FP16 calls *_fp16_* for the dilated convolutions, and thus no speed-up over the corresponding FP32 kernels. Do you know if there is a timeline of supporting dilated convolutions?\r\n- FP16 deconvolutional kernels cudnn::detail::dgrad2d_alg1_1_half<__half...> perform 10-15% worse compared to the corresponding FP32 deconvolutional kernels.
