No new data arrives but the window function is called anyways.\n\nI'm afraid the solution to this really is to change `FoldingState` and `ListState` to return `null` when there is no state available. (Instead of \"default value\" and \"empty iterable\" as it is now). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234959432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234960236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2278#issuecomment-234960236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2278","id":234960236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDk2MDIzNg==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T13:57:08Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T13:57:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review!

good work Max! The changes look good to me and I think it's much cleaner this way. The `DelimitedInputFormat` API change question needs to be addressed before merging I think.\n\nRegarding the other \"API breaking\" changes I'm undecided right now. I fully agree that they are not documented and hence should be fine to remove. On the other hand, the code is not expensive to maintain and if someone is relying on loading of multiple YAML files for example, that will be hard to debug for the user. I feel like it might make sense to get more community feedback before merging this for 1.1 release.

Although the changes in `DelimitedInputFormat` don't break the API according to the API Maven plugin, we can simply deprecate the existing method and call the new method from it.

Note, that the build is a Scala 2.11 build but this should only set the Scala version of dependencies but not change any Flink artifact names (we have a another script for that). When flink-runtime is built, it is built with Scala 2.11 although named flink-runtime_2.10.

We must not use the `scala.binary.version` property in flink artifact names. The property is only for switching Scala dependencies. It is not resolved by Maven in artifact names during deployment which would give us artifact names of the form `flink-runtime_${scala.binary.version}`. The problem is that we set the property in the root pom which can only be deployed one time. Otherwise all artifacts would depend on Scala...a bit nasty.\n\nThe build failures occurred because Maven tried to use the `flink-runtime_2.11` dependency instead of `flink-runtime_2.10` (which is in fact the Scala 2.11 version if you use `-Dscala-2.11`). `flink-runtime_2.11` hadn't been installed previously, causing Maven to download it from the snapshot repository...\n\nI think we're done with this PR after this.

Great work! Thanks a lot for the documentation, it was very helpful. Please don't be scared by all the comments, most of them are minor. The most important points:\n- Do we need to run all the Yarn tests normally and secured? We already have problems with our test execution time. Perhaps we could have one dedicated test for secure setups and disable the other ones by default to run them manually if needed.\n- The testing code seems overly complicated using the custom JUnit Runner. I think we could achieve the same with `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` methods in the secure IT cases. \n- There is no dedicated test for the `SecurityContext` and the `JaasConfiguration` classes\n- It would be nice to add some documentation to the configuration web page.\n- We should throw exceptions if the secure configuration is not complete instead of falling back to non-authenticated execution for either Hadoop or the Jaas configuration. Otherwise, users might end up with a partly secure environment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/235622272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/235662902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2299#issuecomment-235662902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2299","id":235662902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTY2MjkwMg==","user":{"login":"nssalian","id":8526007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MjYwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8526007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian","html_url":"https://github.com/nssalian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T17:42:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T17:42:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi

I think it is a good functionality to add. @shikhar if you'd like to continue working on this, I'm happy to help shepherd this PR for merging.\n\nSome of my input from the previous discussions on the interpretation of `auto.commit.enable`:\nI agree with @rmetzger that stretching the definition of this config to \"on checkpoint or periodically\" isn't a good idea. Committing the offsets back to Kafka on `notifyCheckpointComplete()` is a Flink-specific behaviour. I think mixing Flink-specific behaviour within Kafka original configs can be confusing for frequent Kafka users and difficult to maintain in the long run.\n\nPerhaps we can have something like `flink.commit-on-checkpoint`. What I have in mind:\n\n> // commit to ZK / broker only on Flink's checkpoint.\n> flink.commit-on-checkpoint=true\n> auto.commit.enable=*(will be ignored)\n> \n> // periodically commits to ZK / broker\n> flink.commit-on-checkpoint=false\n> auto.commit.enable=true\n> \n> // no commit to ZK / broker at all\n> flink.commit-on-checkpoint=false\n> auto.commit.enable=false\n\nThe first option will be valid only when checkpointing is enabled also. Otherwise, whether or not checkpointing is enabled does not effect the above settings.\n\nI think this better matches the idea that \"the Kafka offset store is only used for exposure of progress to the outside world, and not for recovery / manipulation of how Flink reads from Kafka\".\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/235838069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/235852484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2305#issuecomment-235852484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2305","id":235852484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTg1MjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T09:59:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T09:59:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The CI failed because of japicmp, as we changed the public API. \n\nHave no idea how to fix this... \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/235852484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/236017137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1690#issuecomment-236017137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1690","id":236017137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjAxNzEzNw==","user":{"login":"shikhar","id":74267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar","html_url":"https://github.com/shikhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T20:35:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T20:35:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @tzulitai!
