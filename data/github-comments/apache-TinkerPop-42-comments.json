I would say that it is not completely \"safe\" to do so because an `eval()` could return anything and thus return a `BulkSet` and the user would expect that and I guess it would unroll to individual items when you iterated which the user wouldn't expect. \r\n\r\n> Should every parameter be bound when building a dynamic script?\r\n\r\nWe refer to what you've done there as a `Translator` (i.e. something that converts bytecode to the string representation of the Gremlin) and that's neat that you have that. We don't implement that as a `toString()` on `Bytecode` but perhaps that's ok though. FYI, here's what a `Translator` looks like in Java:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nString gremlin = GroovyTranslator.of(\"g\").translate(bytecode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't believe that our translators convert arguments to bindings. It assumes them to be literals. We only construct bindings if the user constructs them as first order `Bindings` in the Gremlin itself, but I don't know if we have that concept here in javascript. For consistency sake, we might want to. You can see the approach taken by Python to handle that as an example:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_bindings\r\n\r\n> Does the unit test need to be more thorough and check more varied instructions and more complex glv queries/instructions?\r\n\r\nOn the JVM side we test the translators through the GLV suite (essentially we use the JVM process test suite which is basically the same thing).  Maybe the same should be done here.\r\n\r\nSeparate from your questions, I'd offer that `g.eval()` isn't really in line with how other GLV drivers submit scripts.  While I'd agree it to be convenient to have it work that way, I think it would be better to see that working in a way more consistent with other GLVs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/416544666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/416612204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/905#issuecomment-416612204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/905","id":416612204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjYxMjIwNA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T14:42:16Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T14:42:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@svanteschubert i'm just checking in - do you think you will have time to come back to this pull request to address the comments presented?

Considering the multithreaded asynchronous nature of the server, there is far more advantages in request pipelining than with multiple connections.\r\nConsidering that the server is multithreaded, you can think multiple connections w/o request pipelining as a system using multiple threads and blocking on each thread; being a single connection with request pipelining the equivalent of async non-blocking code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, supporting the same (or more) throughput with fewer connections has the advantage of having less memory consumption and being able to support a greater number of clients.\r\n\r\nRegarding the relation of this ticket with TINKERPOP-1775, I think we have 2 options:\r\na) We see this change as an incremental improvement (which definitely is) without considering TINKERPOP-1775.\r\nb) We try to think now how TINKERPOP-1774 and TINKERPOP-1775 will come into place together, regardless of which we implement first.

They can't be used at that time anyway and I think that the current design is a lot easier where a connection is taken from the pool for the request and returned simply by disposing its `ProxyConnection`.\r\nI think it should be possible to implement such a request pipelining without changing the connection pool completely. The connections would only be returned faster. Balancing requests between connections should also not be necessary as the FIFO nature of the pool should already provide that without any changes.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect we should consider here is that this PR includes breaking changes as it adds a limit to the number of connections that can be used. That is why I would really like this to land in 3.4.0. TINKERPOP-1775 on the other hand can be implemented any time. So, there is no rush to implement it right now and I'm not sure whether I will have the time to also implement that in time for 3.4.0 as I will be OOO for ~2 weeks starting Wednesday and the 3.4.0 release date shouldn't be that far away.\r\nLong story short, I don't think that this PR should be blocked by TINKERPOP-1775 if that means that this PR will have to wait for TinkerPop 3.5.0 or even 4.0.0.

The request finishes as soon as the response is received (like you described with continuous calls to `ReceiveMessageAsync()` and the invoke of the right callback).\r\n\r\nThat way, we don't need a dedicated write queue and most of the connection pool can stay as (relatively) simple as it currently is.\r\n\r\n> There shouldn't be \"in use\" / \"idle\" states of a connection.\r\n\r\nHow do you want to avoid an _in use_ state when the connection cannot be used while it is _in use_, meaning that it is currently sending a message?

Took me way longer than it should have to be honest 😅 \r\n\r\nThe changes would basically look like this if I got everything right:\r\n* `Connection`:\r\n  * Gets its own write queue\r\n  * New requests are simply appended to this queue.\r\n  * Sends messages from its queue as fast as possible, one `SendAsync()` after another\r\n  * Maintains a lookup table: `requestId` --> response callback\r\n  * Continuously `awaits` `ReceiveAsync()` and invokes the right callback for every received response based on the `requestId`\r\n* `ConnectionPool`:\r\n  * Keeps all created `Connections` in its pool (they aren't taken out of the pool completely while in use any more)\r\n  * Either returns a random `Connection` or returns the least-used `Connection` based on an in-flight counter on the `Connection` (the latter would be the better solution but is a bit more complex).\r\n\r\nIs that the design you are proposing or did I still get something wrong?\r\n\r\nI guess what kept me the entire time from understanding this is that I for some reason assumed that messages could be received on a different WebSocket connection than where the send was performed. That would have allowed for an easier approach without the write queue.\r\n\r\nThis brings us now back to your initial question of whether we want to merge the changes from this PR first or whether we want to implement it together with the request pipelining we now discussed in great length.\r\n\r\n@spmallette: Could you say something about the planned release date for TinkerPop 3.4.0? The last statement I remember was something like _end of summer_.\r\n\r\nI could probably try to implement the request pipelining in October, but when code freeze is before that or in the beginning of October, then I'd say that we should definitely merge this PR first. Otherwise, it would have to wait for TinkerPop 3.5.0.\r\n\r\nYour (@jorgebay) argument for implementing both tickets together was:\r\n\r\n> I think we should take the approach in B, otherwise implementing it without thinking of TINKERPOP-1775 might introduce unnecessary complexity (i.e: a queue of connections that get enqueued and dequeued for each request).\r\n\r\nbut this enqueueing and dequeueing of connections is already present in the current implementation.\r\nThis PR basically adds these points:\r\n* Min and max sizes \r\n* [CAS pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap) to ensure that the max size is respected\r\n* An `AsyncAutoResetEvent` to replace the synchronous lock\r\n\r\nI think those three aspects would still be needed with request pipelining. So, in my opinion, this PR is really an incremental improvement that doesn't add much complexity that we might need to remove again in order to implement request pipelining.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/419970452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/420006667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/915#issuecomment-420006667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/915","id":420006667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDAwNjY2Nw==","user":{"login":"ashwinisingh01","id":42292682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjkyNjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42292682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwinisingh01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinisingh01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T18:06:53Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T18:06:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@redoz , Can you submit a PR to TINKERPOP-1913 of my fork https://github.com/ashwinisingh01/tinkerpop?

Limiting the max amount of connections on the C# side without request pipelining will result in very small number of possible simultaneous requests. If later in time we fix request pipeling, with the same settings, the driver will be acting very differently. That's why my vote is either tackle the issues or not, and avoid half baking it.\r\n\r\n> The Java driver waits for an available connection in that case which needs to have less than the `maxSimultaneousUsagePerConnection` requests in progress.\r\n\r\nI think that's a misfeature: if a driver doesn't reject requests after a threshold, unbounded queueing results in memory issues (OOM) that are harder to troubleshoot than a simple exception.\r\nIntroducing a new level of queueing is generally not a good idea, it just pushes the problem closer to the user.  We need a limit, it can be as large as we want.\r\n\r\nFWIW from my experience, all drivers for Apache Cassandra ended up introducing a limit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/420292652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/420306858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/903#issuecomment-420306858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/903","id":420306858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDMwNjg1OA==","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T15:04:43Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T15:04:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> looks like you are focused on getting this one merged\r\n\r\nNo, I don't really mind waiting for TINKERPOP-1775 and implementing both together. I just had two motivations for merging this PR first independently of TINKERPOP-1775:\r\n\r\n1. Adding limits to the `ConnectionPool` is a breaking change and therefore can only go into version 3.4.0 or 3.5.0.\r\n2. From my point of view, the changes from this PR would also be necessary to implement request pipelining.\r\n\r\nPoint 1 introduced some pressure of time for this PR as I don't want to wait for version 3.5.0. However, that isn't valid any more when we don't plan to release 3.4.0 in the next few weeks.\r\nPoint 2 was mainly motivated by the fact that the Java `ConnectionPool` has basically the same implementation as introduced by this PR and I saw that as something like the reference implementation.\r\n\r\nI know that you have way more experience with writing drivers and you made some good points which convince me more and more that the .NET driver could look different than the Java driver when we implement both tickets together.\r\n\r\nSo, I agree and let's wait until we have a PR for both tickets.
