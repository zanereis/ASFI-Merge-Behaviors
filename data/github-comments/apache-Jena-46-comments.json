you very much for all your feedback.\r\n\r\n@rvesse, regarding your attack scenario where the server could run out of memory due to storing all strings until the last result row is sent: that is indeed a valid concern. This vulnerability might make the format less suitable for public SPARQL servers. However, within our cluster, for service-to-service and service-to-UI client communications, it could serve as an effective bandwidth-saving alternative.\r\n\r\nRegarding your concerns about the in-memory measurement, since bandwidth and I/O performance vary greatly across different scenarios, I thought it prudent to exclude these factors from the performance measurements. Are you suggesting that different disk flushing strategies might not have been adequately considered?\r\n\r\n\r\n@afs, it appears that the Protobuf and Thrift formats do not utilize ParserProfileStd, which uses CacheCaffeine with a default cache size of 500. Instead, they employ CacheSimple with a default cache size of 5000. The rationale behind the use of two different LRU cache implementations and varying default cache sizes is unclear to me. Neither Protobuf nor Thrift seems to utilize FactoryRDFCaching, and no caching is applied to results, only to graphs. \r\n--> I could try to use the IRI Cache for the results too and try to measure the impact. Would that be helpful?\r\n--> I could try to use FactoryRDFCaching#createTypedLiteral for the graph and result deserialization and measure the impact. Would that be helpful?\r\n\r\nThe idea of a JVM-wide term cache is intriguing, but I am uncertain about its potential to slow down the system under heavy multithreaded workloads. An alternative could be making it optionally thread-local. Another concern is determining the optimal size for such a cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Back to my current approach:\r\nIntroducing another data format is not my intention.\r\n\r\nTo identify the optimal format for our needs, we conducted extensive benchmarks across various serialization formats, combined with different compression algorithms and levels. We also considered the frequency of graph writes versus reads and the implications for disk space over time. For our use case, RDF_THRIFT_VALUES (soon to be RDF_THRIFT) combined with LZ4_fastest emerged as the best choice.\r\nOur active datasets are maintained as in-memory graphs to ensure peak performance, with only changes being written as deltas into the RDBMS, following a CQRS with event sourcing pattern. A significant bottleneck we've identified is the substantial data traffic generated by services executing numerous parallel queries.\r\n\r\nUpon examining the THRIFT results format, I noticed that all data fields contained strings, with many repetitions.\r\nIn my initial implementation, I simply adapted the THRIFT format and code, substituting all strings with i32 indices and adding string lists to the rows. The modifications to the code were minimal. \r\nFor deserialization in Java, the fastest approach seems to be using a single ArrayList<String>, adding new strings with #addAll, and retrieving corresponding strings with #get(index). \r\nThe downside is that the consumer must retain the expanding string list in memory until the stream is processed. \r\nThe upside is its simplicity and straightforwardness, with an equivalent to ArrayList<String> likely available in other programming languages.\r\n\r\nTHRIFT2 is a variation of THRIFT:\r\n![2024-02-05 21_13_53-jena – BinaryRDF thrift](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/3b2513c5-677e-4a80-9152-a43b55d99f5c)\r\n\r\nI've conducted JMH-benchmarks on several graphs that I had access to:\r\n- pizza.owl.rdf and cheese.ttl (I sometimes left these out of some benchmarks due to their relatively small size)\r\n- RealGrid_EQ.xml, RealGrid_SSH.xml, RealGrid_TP.xml, RealGrid_SV.xml (these are sample datasets from the CGMES conformity assessment, available for download at [ENTSO-E](https://www.entsoe.eu/Documents/CIM_documents/Grid_Model_CIM/TestConfigurations_packageCASv2.0.zip))\r\n- xxx_CGMES_EQ.xml, xxx_CGMES_SSH.xml, xxx_CGMES_TP.xml (these are real datasets from one of our projects and are not publicly available)\r\n- bsbm-1m.nt.gz\r\n\r\nEach of these datasets, especially the EQ, SSH, TP, and SV graphs, has a unique structure, leading to varying distributions of subjects, predicates, and objects.\r\n\r\nSince additional compression often seems to be relevant, I measured uncompressed, GZIP-compressed and LZ4Fastest-compressed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the SPARQL query results, I opted for a straightforward \"SELECT ?s ?p ?o FROM ...\" query. Based on my observations, I don't believe the choice of query would significantly alter the outcomes.\r\n\r\nHere I compared THRIFT with my implementation (currently named THRIFT2):\r\n\r\n**Speed of a roundtrip**\r\nThe simplest approach to measure speed is a simple roundtrip of serialization and deserialization. If the producer has significantly more or less resources than the consumer, this perspective is, of course, too simplified. If data is written more often than read, or the other way around, with other formats, this perspective is too simplified.\r\n\r\n![Speed of SPARQL-Result Serialization+Deserialization-Roundtrip - Thrift vs  Thrif2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/5764ef54-3e8c-4e0c-a9e7-0b608c41f208)\r\n--> For SPARQL-results, THRIFT2 outperforms THRIFT in all cases and with all tested compressions.\r\n\r\n![Speed of Graph Serialization+Deserialization-Roundtrip - Thirft vs  Thrift2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/ef4f9705-cf43-4ed0-90ee-50ac2dd73732)\r\n--> For graphs, THRIFT2 outperforms THRIFT in combination with compression but not uncompressed.\r\n\r\n**Size**\r\nFor the size, I simply calculated the number of triples per MB:\r\n\r\n![Serialized SPARQL-Results - Thrift vs  Thrif2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/7d86b23f-76ad-44ef-84aa-526f012e4c42)\r\n--> Uncompressed THRIFT2 SPARQL-results are in all cases at least 50% smaller than uncompressed THRIFT.\r\n\r\n![Serialized Graphs - Thrift vs  Thrif2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/90bf4354-0aa8-4848-afbf-9d73461f3e8f)\r\n--> Uncompressed THRIFT2 graphs are in all cases at least 50% smaller than uncompressed THRIFT.\r\n\r\n**Speed of serialization**\r\n![Speed of SPARQL-Result Serialization - Thrift vs  Thrif2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/b79cafe9-db0a-4adb-9c53-4d8de3cfbba6)\r\n![Speed of Graph Serialization - Thrift vs  Thrif2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/94e15fdc-d6f7-42d4-b834-3c88dc88f6f9)\r\n--> Overall, THRIFT2 is faster than THRIFT during serialization.\r\n\r\n**Speed of deserialization**\r\n\r\n![Speed of SPARQL-Result Deserialization - Thrift vs  Thrif2](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/53625519/79b41cba-c434-452b-a72c-7b40be89851c)\r\n--> In combination with compression, THRIFT2 outperforms THRIFT for SPARQL-results.

But I chose to use the plain `bootstrap` dependency instead, which brings just the CSS/JS from the original Bootstrap code to [our list of JS dependencies](https://github.com/apache/jena/blob/63dc60bd9f931d0ea09bcdc52b263a5afa3a4369/jena-fuseki2/jena-fuseki-ui/package.json#L21-L34).\r\n\r\nThe main reason for that is that in JS once you add a dependency, it normally brings `N` transitive dependencies (and `N` may be in the tens, hundreds, thousands :exploding_head: ). Fuseki UI is rather small, so crafting these small components like tables, pagination, forms, is not too hard.\r\n\r\nThe only complex part is the query editor, but we use an external dependency for that one. Less dependencies, less overhead to maintain security & upgrades.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1958898777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1961221009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1929#issuecomment-1961221009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1929","id":1961221009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec505duR","user":{"login":"OyvindLGjesdal","id":5328572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjg1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5328572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal","html_url":"https://github.com/OyvindLGjesdal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindLGjesdal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-23T12:13:20Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T12:15:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tested the new release candidate from windows for Apache jena commands, and this looks fixed (in the sense that the error is now directly findable, with line and col-number) in the new default rdf/xml implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\\riot.bat --validate example.rdf-xml.owl\r\n\r\n13:07:13 WARN  riot            :: [line: 129901, col: 115] Lexical form '1915-1919' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:13 WARN  riot            :: [line: 131181, col: 118] Lexical form '<1857>' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:13 WARN  riot            :: [line: 131706, col: 109] Lexical form '825' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:15 WARN  riot            :: [line: 615032, col: 108] Lexical form '865-12-31' not valid for datatype XSD date\r\n13:07:15 WARN  riot            :: [line: 615056, col: 108] Lexical form '865-12-31' not valid for datatype XSD date\r\n13:07:15 WARN  riot            :: [line: 615080, col: 108] Lexical form '865-12-31' not valid for datatype XSD date\r\n13:07:15 WARN  riot            :: [line: 657190, col: 108] Lexical form '184-12-31' not valid for datatype XSD date\r\n13:07:15 WARN  riot            :: [line: 657693, col: 115] Lexical form '1914-1915' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:15 WARN  riot            :: [line: 657737, col: 115] Lexical form '1915-1916' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:16 WARN  riot            :: [line: 771357, col: 110] Lexical form '1917-04-05' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:16 WARN  riot            :: [line: 771358, col: 110] Lexical form '1993-08-10' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n13:07:16 WARN  riot            :: [line: 787296, col: 109] Lexical form '1910-19-9' not valid for datatype XSD gYear\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for the fix!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1961221009/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1961437916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2280#issuecomment-1961437916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/2280","id":1961437916,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec506Src","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-23T14:31:09Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T14:35:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Current dependabot configuration:\r\n```\r\n  -

It turns out that so far there is no public API for `QueryExecHTTPBuilderOverRDFLinkHTTP.queryStringValidated`, i.e. set a query string and have it processed according to the RDFLinkHTTP config. The existing approaches are:\r\n\r\n* The `query(String)` methods are all expected to parse the query string so that e.g. substitution can be performed\r\n* The `queryString(String)` method on `ExecHTTPBuilder` explicitly states that `The queryString is not interpreted and it may contain SPARQL syntax extensions supported by the target triple store`. My interpretation is that this method should bypass all client side validation and send the query string as is.\r\n\r\n2. `QueryType` does not discriminate between construct triples and construct quads.
