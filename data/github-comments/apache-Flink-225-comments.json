Currently, this goes through methods on one state backend objects, i.e., *configuration in code*. Because that recovery aspect is a really an \"ops-related\" aspect of running a Flink job (or a broader streaming platform), it should not be configured in code, but in the config. I found it helpful to thing that settings in code are for what concerns the application developers, settings in the config for what concerns the people that run Flink. They may be the same person in the end, but even then it is helpful because they are frequently are in different stages of the application development and deployment. Configurations are more easy to \"standardize on\", like \"we want all applications in that group to enable local recovery\".\r\n\r\n  - One thing I am not yet 100% sure of is how this will interact in the future with RocksDB's optimized local recovery. I assume that checkpoints will in the future always use incremental snapshots. For such, there is no stream of bytes to store locally in addition. The files are already local and immutable. Here, the RocksDB snapshot should probably directly go through the local recovery directory, and the diff files would be persisted from there (the complete snapshot, which consists only of hardlinks to the files that are also in the work directory, would be retained though). Is the assumption that this is a \"retain data structure\" style mechanism, bespoke for each state backend, similar as retaining the heap copy-on-write table for the Heap State Backend?\r\n\r\nNow, since this PR is already complicated and needs a heavy rebase, I would be okay with doing that in another PR, if there is commitment to do this soon (before the 1.5 release branch is cut).\r\n\r\nSlightly off topic: This code has a very distinct style of using many `@Nonnull` annotations. Other newer parts of the code (the once that use annotations) follow the contract \"non-null unless annotated with `@Nullable`\". I don't ask to change this. Would be good to actually have a discussion and come up with a recommended style to agree on for the future.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356383855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/356392219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4150#issuecomment-356392219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4150","id":356392219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjM5MjIxOQ==","user":{"login":"bowenli86","id":1892692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTI2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1892692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86","html_url":"https://github.com/bowenli86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bowenli86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T19:42:40Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T19:42:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for confirming.
