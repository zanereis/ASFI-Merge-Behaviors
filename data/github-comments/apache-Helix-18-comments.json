The main blocker is that we don't have a good way to track instance assignment records when the domain-awareness configuration is turned on and off.\r\nSo if we record domain ID, then when the option is off, we lose track. If we record the instance name, then when the option is on, then we also lose track.\r\n\r\nA better way might be tracking both names in the record. So if the domain name exists, then we record both names in the record with some encoding logic.\r\n\r\nThen we can use either name based on whether domain-awareness is opt-in.\r\n\r\nNote there might be a corner case that we see conflict names between the records and current instance config. For example, in the record, instance A has domain name A, instance B has domain name B. While their domain name is switched currently. So what shall we take? The complex here is that the domain-awareness option might also be switched in between.\r\nFor this, we need a good strategy of which name to take under which condition.\r\n\r\nOverall, recording both names shall work. But we will need a more detailed design.\r\n\r\nNote that it is still not convinced that we need to support this feature for WAGED. The graceful node swap was designed to avoid partition shuffling when users are using delayedRebalancer + Crush(Ed). For WAGED, many of the assumptions have been changed. There won't be shuffling happen even the new node is joining with a different name.\r\n\r\nSo this is not a high priority task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/719748833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/719750019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1428#issuecomment-719750019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1428","id":719750019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTc1MDAxOQ==","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-30T19:22:34Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T19:22:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This multi() is targeted to fix recently identified \"phantom\" read problem when refreshing the cache using selective update.
