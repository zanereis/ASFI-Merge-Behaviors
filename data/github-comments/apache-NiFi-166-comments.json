This is definitely not an urgent thing. And if it's the occasion to rethink other aspects of the container images building process that may be a good occasion and I'd be happy to help. Meanwhile I can keep a separate project (in my repo or another Red Hat repo) only for the OpenShift building recipes, not keeping the whole NiFi tree.\r\nApart from the source image and the installed packages that differ a little bit because it's not the same base distro, the changes are all related to the way the NiFi files are installed: ownership (for OpenShift GID has to be set to zero to support arbitrary UID) and access writes. In fact this could even be applied to the way the images are currently built without that many consequences (although it would require some more reflexion).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1021556910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1022104731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5692#issuecomment-1022104731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5692","id":1022104731,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM487BSb","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-26T11:19:28Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T11:19:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The reason why we can't rely on the ```DBCPConnectionPool.getDriver()``` is that the subsequent ```Class.forName()``` call uses the classloader of the caller class.

And registry.  However, we simply cannot have such a disruptive process.  We're not truly exposed to the H2 vulnerabilities in question that we know of anyway so we can and should try to do more for the users here.\r\n\r\nFor NiFi H2 usage is for audit data and auth stuff. For auth it is fairly transient meaning users can just relogin in after the upgrade if we lost the data.  For the audit data we can say they'll lose it.  But lets try to do better.  Lets try to have old h2 lib when we detect the old format.  It would dump out the SQL statements/export of the old db.  Then it is off/done closed out.  Then we have new h2/v2 take over and import.  This should keep the users stuff all happy/they lose nothing.  And while technically the h2 1.x jars are still present we can easily declare we dont expose the vulnerability.  Later we can delete it entirely such as at a major version change (nifi 2.x).\r\n\r\nFor the registry..well...we gotta make it seamless like the above.\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately I think we need to do a good bit more work here.  This as is simply causes to much disruption for users.  A toolkit option is also viable but introduces considerable additional complexity that we usually reserve for major upgrades.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1024402198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1024419812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5303#issuecomment-1024419812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5303","id":1024419812,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM49D2fk","user":{"login":"jfrazee","id":47344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T16:58:19Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T16:58:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@timeabarna Sorry for taking so long.

Think 100-200 characters or less, generally. They should store things like `filename = my-file.txt` and `documentId = 27830278`, etc. Tiny key-value pairs. They should never contain large amounts of contents like XML or JSON.\r\n\r\nTo fully understand why, consider how attributes are handled.\r\n- Firstly, they are stored in HashMaps on the FlowFile and are always stored in memory (unless swapped out in a queue). This very quickly results in massive amounts of garbage collection and OutOfMemoryErrors.\r\n- They also have to be written out to the FlowFile Repository when any attribute changes. If you change the filename, for instance, the next update to the FlowFile repository writes out *all* attributes. Now, if we have an 8 KB XML message in an attribute, we don't write 200 bytes, we write 8 KB. Potentially every time the FlowFile moves from 1 queue to the next.\r\n- We also have to write the attributes for every single Provenance event. So we have doubled the expense just mentioned.\r\n- If the data is swapped out, we get to remove it from heap. But that happens by default at 20,000 FlowFiles and only in chunks of 10,000 FlowFiles. So we need to buffer about 30,000 FlowFiles *per FlowFile Queue*!\r\n- And if we swap it out, we then get to drop those attributes from the heap, but we have to write out that big XML chunk *again*. And we have to read it in and deserialize it again when swapping back in. Performance will suffer greatly.\r\n\r\nBut out of all of these concerns, the greatest, by far, is the heap exhaustion and OutOfMemoryErrors that get generated. When a user buffers a bunch of data into FlowFile attributes, they can significantly affect all users of the system. Once you buffer so much that you start throwing OutOfMemoryErrors, you're now into an area where you can potentially even start to affect the stability of the cluster because nodes are constantly performing garbage collection, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, we should very much discourage putting XML, JSON, or any other large chunks of content into FlowFile attributes. So I have trouble supporting any update that further encourages this anti-pattern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1031949097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1031990263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5324#issuecomment-1031990263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5324","id":1031990263,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM49guv3","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T22:16:06Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T22:16:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So a summary of sorts: Improving validation of XML in content is good/great/useful and safe.  Creating or increasing validation of XML in the context of attributes is far less desirable as having such payloads in attributes should not be encouraged given the design reasons MarkP noted. \r\n\r\nI do agree.  \r\n\r\nTo add to this I just spent 45 minutes on a call with a great long time user of nifi, they know what they're doing, and they're getting bit by the usage of large memory caused by very similar circumstances.  And had they looked at the docs it would have called out how to avoid getting into the memory exhausting situation but these are rarely sufficient guard rails particularly as the user base has expanded well beyond software developers the past few years.\r\n\r\nMarkB in an earlier JIRA comment said \" I find it overly limiting to prevent responsible usage only for fear it may be abused.\"  Of course many of us would agree with that statement on its own.  But we do need put in reasonable effort to not lean into features which encourage dangerous usage patterns OR we need to include features that by default prevent exposure the danger of the pattern.  In this case we'd be hard pressed to put an artificial limit on attribute size now that we didnt from the get go.  On the other hand it isn't a great idea to encourage large attributes by adding capabilities to operate on them.\r\n\r\nUltimately this part of the community job is unpleasant.  Saying no to someone doing work is not fun especially since we know YOU know how to use it safely.  Saying yes to this example is also not fun because it means we're implicitly adding support for a usage pattern we know we have not designed for and for which we see users run into trouble all the time.\r\n\r\nWe have many cases where we've been inconsistent on such things and this is by no means the straw that would break our back.  That said we do need to push back where we can and the review process is a helpful way.  MarkB you certainly could put up a processor such as ValidateXMLAttribute and offer that via a github repository.  We could link to such custom processors as we have done in other cases.

We would need to settle for the properties not to have different `name` and `displayName`. Btw this is a decision that is basically final. We won't be able back down on that.\r\n2. Here's how the code would look like:\r\nInstead of this:\r\n```java\r\n    private static final List<PropertyDescriptor> properties;\r\n\r\n    static {\r\n        final List<PropertyDescriptor> props

question that the former is better even if we agree to 1.\r\n\r\nWith the datasource duplication we would do something like this:\r\nIn  DBCPConnectionPool we would add the following method: \r\n```java\r\n    protected void setDatasourceSettingsExceptDriverOfCourse(\r\n        String dburl,\r\n        String user,\r\n        String passw,\r\n        Integer maxTotal,\r\n        Long

Also, thanks for detailing the reasons of why this can be a problem for other users who may not be aware. Rest assured, these were all considerations and well within the understanding and scope of the use case which drove this ticket. We have never had OOM issues, and the usage is for approximately 200 FlowFiles per day with reasonably sized XML attributes.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the necessity to prevent “bad things” happening as much as possible. While I respectfully disagree with limiting the platform out of fear of self-induced problems, I understand such problems do occur in the real world.\r\n\r\nSince NiFi is easily extensible, we will apply these changes to a custom processor to satisfy the specific case without injecting it to the NiFi community.\r\n\r\n@joewitt I hear what you’re saying about being inconsistent. A prime example related to this PR for processing XML in attributes is available right in Expression Language. It has functions such as (un)escapeXml, and also (un)escapeJson and (un)escapeHtml. It seems the availability of these functions promotes placing XML (or JSON or HTML) into attributes equally as much as this PR, or even more since EL can be applied to a wide variety of processors. EL even has other jsonPath* functions whose simple examples in the EL Guide include 300-500 character JSON strings. Perhaps these examples should be updated to simpler JSON more consistent with the recommended limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1033290551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1033294298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5704#issuecomment-1033294298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5704","id":1033294298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM49ltHa","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T03:02:17Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T03:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution @Noel-bk!

In a nifi 2.0 world I think we ought to punt those out for the reasons we are talking about here or at least make the danger of their usage more obvious.  I'm not sure that view is widely shared but the more I spend time with users who truly just dont know these things the more we have to find reasonable ways to provide safety.  On the other hand...the more we turn this into a safety tool the less powerful it is for the more capable people.  I'm not sure what the best way to thread that needle is without coming across or acting inconsistently.  Maybe we were on the right track with annotations which alerted the user to such things but we need to make that a more prominent part of the user experience.\r\n\r\notto i do think we have some limit on the size of attributes or at least I know we considered it.  On the other hand we also have to consider how many attributes there can be on a given flowfile.  But then on top of that we have to consider how many flowfiles can be in the system at any one time and of that how many can have their metadata in memory at any one time.  It is not uncommon to see real user flows with hundreds of thousands or millions of flowfiles in flight at any one time under normal conditions.  The swapping stuff helps but doesn't eliminate the problem.  Hard limits become tricky as they're fairly arbitrary.  \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1033295071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1033304869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5324#issuecomment-1033304869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5324","id":1033304869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM49lvsl","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T03:23:12Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T03:23:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On further thought...\r\n\r\nIn this PR we do have an annotation to warn users.

So here's my personal viewpoint.\r\n\r\n- I do agree that we have several things already like `jsonPath` functions in Expression Language, escapeHtml, etc. That should never have existed.\r\n- I do agree also that there could be some applicable use cases. I can imagine having some metadata that is say < 1 KB of XML that could be in an attribute. It's probably rare but definitely feasible.\r\n- My concern here is that by enabling this, we may further perpetuate the idea that it's ok to put arbitrarily large chunks of data in attributes.\r\n- @markobean I know you have significant experience here and it probably makes perfect sense for your use case. However, the more I interact with users, the more that I see this pattern of attributes are keyed content, and it creates a lot of issues. While it probably makes perfect sense for your use case, I'm concerned about encouraging those with less experience.\r\n- The annotation does provide some warning.\r\n- The processor itself isn't designed to create large attributes from content - only verify that already exists as an attribute is, in fact, valid. Without it, the solution may be to simply create the attribute anyway and avoid performing any validation on it, potentially leading to errors later in the flow.\r\n\r\nI personally don't like adding this in such that we further encourage poor flow design patterns. That said, these are well thought-out, well-articulated arguments. While I won't vote a +1 for this issue & merge the PR, I won't vote a -1 either. I'll say I'm a +0. Fair enough?\r\n\r\n@exceptionfactory if you are comfortable with the changes, you should feel free to merge from my standpoint.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1034006358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1034153201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5301#issuecomment-1034153201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5301","id":1034153201,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM49o-zx","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T20:14:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T20:14:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1034153201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1034217925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5742#issuecomment-1034217925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5742","id":1034217925,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM49pOnF","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-09T21:40:53Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T21:40:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, with Kevin's +1 and a happy CI this is good to go.

I've been playing around with it, and I think design works well. A few recommendations, though, around tooltips and defaults to help simplify the configuration and make things more seamless for others:\r\n\r\n- For \"Number of Retry Attempts\" I would recommend adding a tooltip that reads something along the lines of: \"If a FlowFile is routed to one of the Relationships that is selected for retry, this indicates how many times the FlowFile will be retried before being routed to the associated Relationship. The total number of attempts will be one more than the configured value of Retry attempts.\" Perhaps a bit less wordy :)\r\n- Also for the backoff policy I would recommend a tooltip that explains the difference. When penalizing, the retried FlowFile will be retried after some time, but the processor will process other FlowFiles in the meantime. However, if FlowFile ordering is necessary, Yielding can be used ensure that no other FlowFiles are processed until the first one has completed all retries.\r\n- Would also recommend the verbiage \"yield processor\" rather than \"yield entire processor\"\r\n- re: \"Retry Max Backoff Period\" - the first time a FlowFile is retried, it will be penalized - or the processor yielded - based on the Penalty Duration / Yield Duration configured in the Settings tab.

Moving this handling to a separate processor provides the opportunity to make the character set a configurable property, which is not currently necessary when processing FlowFile content input streams.
