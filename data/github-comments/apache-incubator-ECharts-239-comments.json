It works great but It doesn't work as I expect. When xAxis is set to type='time', time label is adjust to the range selected but if I set formatter, it doesn't adjust. \r\n\r\nFor example, without formatter, if xAxis range is one day, time label only shows hour and minutes {HH:mm}. If range is one month, xAxis label shows date {MM-DD-YY}. However, if I set formatter, i.e. as {DD-MM-YY}, that is the format forever and range is indifferent. If I select one day range, format is again DD-MM-YY and not HH:mm as expected.\r\n\r\nThat's the reason I ask if there is any way to set format but adjust the \"range format\" at same time.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/537084394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/537097952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11361#issuecomment-537097952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11361","id":537097952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzA5Nzk1Mg==","user":{"login":"amygroshek","id":746182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/746182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek","html_url":"https://github.com/amygroshek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amygroshek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T15:42:50Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T15:44:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yufeng04 That's great.
