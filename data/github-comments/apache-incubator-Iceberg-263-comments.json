Some engines may support field aliases, but others do not so they don't apply equally to the representations and is inconsistent with the spec, which has them at the representation level.  \r\n\r\nI think it's fine to omit the default catalog and default namespaces, especially if we can appropriately qualify them in the engine when constructing the sql representation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1622249389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1622327521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7992#issuecomment-1622327521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7992","id":1622327521,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85gssDh","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T19:15:47Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T19:15:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nastra, the example you gave would not be allowed:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nView view = catalog.buildView(identifier)\r\n  .withSchema(schema)\r\n  .withQuery(\"spark\", \"select a,b from ns.tbl\")\r\n  .withQuery(\"trino\", \"select a,b,c from ns.tbl\")\r\n  .createOrReplace()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe representations must produce the same schema.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1622327521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1622407657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7895#issuecomment-1622407657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7895","id":1622407657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85gs_np","user":{"login":"DaVincii","id":5258130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTgxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5258130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii","html_url":"https://github.com/DaVincii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaVincii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T19:57:47Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T19:57:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nastra Updated the pull request with the review changes, please review.

issue was resolved. The root cause of this problem was when the PySpark shell is not terminated correctly (i.e. without explicitly calling `exit()`). Here are the steps to re-create the problem: \r\n1.

Re-open PySpark shell\r\n5. Execute the structured streaming code above\r\n \r\nI was able to successfully execute the [original code](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7627#issue-1713029907) after re-creating my Spark

The changelog table reader reads rows with the current schema even schemas may be different across multiple snapshots. In that case, it either throws extra columns or return null for missing columns. I think the simplest way now is to check if schemas of all snapshots in a given range are the same, and throw if not.  For future improvement, we can explore a better way to handle different schemas, but I feel it is hard to handle different schema within one procedure call. Users may have to handle that situation by themselves. cc @aokolnychyi ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629416208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629465298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8027#issuecomment-1629465298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8027","id":1629465298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hH6rS","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T18:13:27Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T18:13:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Looks like a clean backport, merged, thanks @nastra !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629465298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629468172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8033#issuecomment-1629468172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8033","id":1629468172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hH7YM","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T18:15:43Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T18:15:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@nastra should we also add this to 1.3.1?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629468172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1629470789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8033#issuecomment-1629470789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8033","id":1629470789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85hH8BF","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T18:17:42Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T18:18:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Added tag, let me know if it should not be.
