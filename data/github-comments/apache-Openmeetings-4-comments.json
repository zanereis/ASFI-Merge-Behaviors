very much for your info. I am not sure if this is the right place to ask, but do you know it is possible at all to read the screenshare stream in OpenMeetings and convert it with ffmpeg? I was able to get the stream source rtmp:// url, but it gives input/output error in ffmpeg, when I inspect the traffic using Wireshark, RTMP connection was able to established but video and audio data were never sent. Is this all Red5 thing or did OpenMeetings customize the code. Thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/comments/786753592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/comments/786987388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openmeetings/issues/133#issuecomment-786987388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/133","id":786987388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4Njk4NzM4OA==","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-27T02:20:08Z","updated_at":"2021-02-27T02:20:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Screenshare

Except all new behaviour is in the OpenMeetings-core module.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of functionality in the StreamProcessor and KurentoHandler that have nothing to do with Streaming or Kurento:\r\n- All those \"static\" methods. Why are they in those classes? They belong into a Util class.\r\n- There are a lot of methods to \"checkRights\" in the StreamProcessor, what for? Those methods only check on the \"Client\" nothing to do with Streaming or StreamProcessor\r\n- A lot of the methods are just \"facade\", for example streamProcessor::isSharing => Calls kHandler.getRoom() => Why not directly calls kHandler.getRoom() ? I has nothing to do with Streaming.\r\n- StreamProcessor::startConvertion => Why is that in the StreamProcessor ? It starts a new thread to process a recording/. It has nothing to do on the stream. Doesn't require anything from it. There is just no reason why its in this class\r\n\r\nAnd the list could be going on for a lot longer.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great to refactor those methods out of those classes. And then those interfaces would become a lot smaller and better (and also a lot easier to use!).\r\n\r\nAnd then it would be a lot easier to actually do the different Kurento and Stream handling! Cause you don't need to worry about all those other internal OpenMeetings functionality!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/comments/790439102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/comments/791246839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openmeetings/pull/136#issuecomment-791246839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/136","id":791246839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTI0NjgzOQ==","user":{"login":"sebawagner","id":5152064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTIwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5152064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner","html_url":"https://github.com/sebawagner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebawagner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T08:17:53Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T08:17:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can this be merged?

I can just merge master to the 6-2 branch\r\n\r\nBut 6.2.0 is not ready to being released yet. This Notification API fix doesn't fix https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENMEETINGS-2679.
