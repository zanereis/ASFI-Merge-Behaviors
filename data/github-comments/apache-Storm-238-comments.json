Kafka allows to use dot for naming topic but automatically convert to underscore due to metric names. It would make collision between dot and underscore so Kafka needs to handle another collision check.</p>\n\n<p>They seem to show warning message on creating topic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARNING: Due to limitations in metric names, topics with a period ('.') or underscore ('_') could collide. To avoid issues it is best to use either, but not both.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We can do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, they also restrict characters consisting topic name.
