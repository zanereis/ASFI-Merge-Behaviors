Actually in this case, we did not want to send all updates (progress status updates corresponding to reload, force_commit, rebalance) to a single Znode as that would become a bottleneck. Instead have a Znode per update type which is fixed/constant (3). This Znode is not per table. Its per type (3 types) and takes updates for all tables.

We can only use the simple field because map field is reserved for segment assignment. For job status, we want to keep different job status apart by using the map field\r\n2. It will be hard to use the simple field to track multiple tasks of the same task type on the same table (e.g. I reloaded multiple segments within a table)\r\n3. To gather the job status for a given job type, we need to loop over all the IS, which is very inefficient\r\n\r\nAnother main difference for this vs pause consumption is that we are adding very few ZNodes here, one per task type, so there won't be scale issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1490988991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1491001534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10511#issuecomment-1491001534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10511","id":1491001534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Y3uC-","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-30T21:39:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T06:39:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10511?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10511](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10511?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (0e929fa) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/40ac22da06b3f2f7cfc3eb90a0b00afad08e8be8?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (40ac22d) will **decrease** coverage by `0.24%`.\n> The diff coverage is `33.33%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10511      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.20%   69.97%   -0.24%     \n- Complexity     6113     6120       +7     \n============================================\n  Files          2090     2092       +2     \n  Lines        112206   112711     +505     \n  Branches      17077    17143      +66     \n============================================\n+ Hits          78778    78869      +91     \n- Misses        27876    28262     +386     \n- Partials       5552     5580      +28     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `24.36% <33.33%> (-0.25%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `24.16% <0.00%> (-0.07%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `67.54% <0.00%> (-0.31%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `13.89% <0.00%> (-0.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Before we get to the znode creation. why are we not using the existing task framework for this? there is nothing stopping us from creating a task for each of these commands that need to run in background.. the only difference is controllers running the tasks instead of minions.\r\n> \r\n> Creating a task and managing fault tolerance etc is not trivial. Using the existing task framework allows us to leverage all the things we build for minion in terms of getting progress updates, the UI will have a tab to show the pending tasks etc.\r\n\r\n@kishoreg I think these are two very different questions. We didn't leverage the task framework for controller task in the first place because directly executing the controller task is much lighter weight for both coding perspective and execution perspective (no need to implement separate task generator/executor, no need to serialize task config etc.). We can consider moving it to task framework so that we get the fault tolerance (retry/cancel logic) from the task framework, but that involves very big change. We'll need to introduce the controller task executor concept, and ingest the resource manager into the controller task executor. That is out of the scope of this PR since this PR only splits the ZNode for all task types into one per task type.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1491025323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1491025449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10468#issuecomment-1491025449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10468","id":1491025449,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Y3z4p","user":{"login":"claudeyj","id":42714590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzE0NTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42714590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj","html_url":"https://github.com/claudeyj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claudeyj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-30T22:07:41Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T22:07:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for fixing this!
