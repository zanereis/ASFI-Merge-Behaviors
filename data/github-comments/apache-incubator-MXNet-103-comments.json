I'm trying to find a way to reduce every epoch/iteration time, so that to finish processing image more quickly.\nI'm new to ML. Using multi-gpu on forward/backward may fit my needs.\nThanks again.\n\nUpdate：\nThe document gives `mx.model.FeedForward()` for multi-gpu example, which uses `DataParallelExecutorManager` for multi-device support. So I guess there may not be painless way(a few lines, maybe) to add multi-gpu support for neural style work.\nAlso [README.md](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/neural-style/README.md) says \n\n> We will release multi-GPU version soon.\n\nLooking forward to this feature.

sequence Len vs mask. I think we came up with the mask idea because that is the most straightforward way to implement in our current code base, you just need to have a broadcasting multiplication.\n\nHowever, if we are to do rnn symbol fusion that encapsulate the whole operation as a big operator, then underlying I guess using either would be fine.\n\nMask is slightly more general as one could put more than one very short sequences in one slot when batching with very long sequences. However, I am not sure how often we need to do this or how useful it is, and it is probably not useful for bidirectional or more complicated models.\n\nIn summary, I guess if we are to do rnn fusion, we may choose whatever makes it easy to do internal implementation. It seems seq Len is easier as it is of more constrained case.
