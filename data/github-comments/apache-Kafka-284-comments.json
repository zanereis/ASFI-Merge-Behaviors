PR adds a lot of improvements for running kafka tests on Docker.\r\n\r\n* Allow limiting the amount of memory which docker containers take\r\n* Allow using iptables and sudo from inside docker\r\n* Do not run tests as root -- run them as the ducker user instead\r\n* set DEBIAN_FRONTEND in the Dockerfile\r\n* Add the ability to log into docker containers from the shell (ducker-ak ssh)\r\n* Add the ability to purge old docker containers that are no longer in use (ducker-ak purge)\r\n* Fix an issue where docker containers were sometimes not rebuilt for users after the Dockerfile was updated\r\n* Generate a new private key for each new Docker container, rather than using a static private key checked into

is definitely useful for the admin to be able to fix the bad disk while the broker is running. I think it requires a new KIP in addition to KIP-112 and KIP-113 because it takes new tool script and notification event which is not currently included in those two KIPs. Is it OK for me work on this as a new KIP after KIP-112 and KIP-113 is completed?\"\r\n\r\n@lindong28 : For the above, I wasn't referring to the case when the admin fixes the disk and then notifies the broker about the fix online. The case that I was referring to is that when a disk is marked offline, if the admin can fix the disk while the broker is still online, then the admin can just restart the broker quickly after the disk is fixed. The downtime window for that broker is just the restart time. If the admin has to first shut down the broker and then fix the disk, the time for fixing the disk is part of the downtime window. So, my question is that is there any issue that prevents the admin from fixing the offline disk while the broker is up (e.g., the mmap-ed files on the bad disk).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/309918401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/309919498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3012#issuecomment-309919498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3012","id":309919498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTkxOTQ5OA==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-20T23:24:54Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T23:24:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Thanks for the explanation. I think I understand your point now. My understanding is that you are concerned with the possibility of broker crash with single disk failure due to mapped files issue.\r\n\r\nBecause I don't have multiple disk devices on my desktop to test mount/unmount of log directories while broker is running, I will test it in dev test cluster and I am waiting for SRE to mount/unmount log directory for me since they have the sudo access. I will let you know the result tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI have also gone through the blog of mapped files you provided. Most of the issue (e.g. limited number of mmap handlers) are the same between RAID-10 broker and JBOD broker. Since we are not having them now, I assume we won't have them with JBOD in the near future. The only issue that is more likely to happen with JBOD is that JVM may crash when disk gets full. It is more likely to happen with JBOD because the single JBOD log directory will have smaller size than the RAID-10 log directory.\r\n\r\nWe currently use mmap files for reading/writing to index files. The solution suggested by the blog is to write to index files using `FileChannel` instead of mmap files. It is mentioned that performance is minimal if large blocks are used. However, it is not clear whether there will be significant performance hit for index file write operation since the block size for index file write is small.\r\n\r\nSuppose we can not use `FileChannel` to write to index files due to performance reason, then I think the solution is for Kafka administrator to properly monitor the usage of log directories on brokers and rebalance usage across log directories before any log directory gets full. For example rebalance can be triggered if usage exceeds 60%. In the rare case that there is extreme traffic spike that exhausts the space of a log directory, it seems OK to just let this broker fail. It will reduce availability of the broker in any unnecessary manner but it seems OK if this happens rarely.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I will test how broker handles umount of log directory while it is running. And KIP-113 provides a reasonable solution to deal with VM crash due to full disk. Does this sound
