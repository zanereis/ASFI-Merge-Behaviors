With log4j 1.x I got\r\n``07 Nov 2017 23:28:57,156 INFO  [lifecycleSupervisor-1-0] (org.apache.flume.node.PollingPropertiesFileConfigurationProvider.start:62)  - Configuration provider starting``\r\nThis doesn't match what you have above. For some reason you have the month as \"nov.\". I am not sure how you are getting that as the pattern uses \"MMM\" which is handled by SimpleDateFormat in Log4j 1, which prints Nov as I have here.\r\n\r\nAlso, based on what you posted above I modified the log4j 2 configuration so that it doesn't print anything if there is no NDC and there is only one space as that is what I see above. However, when I look at the output I get from Log4j 1 I am seeing 2 spaces before the '-'. I noticed that when I include that string here that the double space is being converted to a single space, so I am guessing I really need to modify the pattern to emit 2 spaces when the NDC isn't present instead of just 1.\r\n\r\nAre you using the standard conf/log4j.properties in the gzipped tar built by flume-ng-dist?
