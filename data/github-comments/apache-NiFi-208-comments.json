Hilariously reducing the number of log impls changes the behavior of aws-processors test.  I had to change that in NIFI-12998 but now that it is back to one the assertions are different.  I didn't look into why but that is...funny.\r\n\r\nThe root of the adjustment here is we took logback-classic and logback-core out out of the dependency set (still in dep mgmt) of nifi-bom.  This makes sense given we dont want things actually having compile time deps on them anyway.  I did mark them as 'runtime' scope instead of provided.  Meanwhile the nifi-py4j-bridge DOES have a direct code based requirement for logback-classic (and thus core).  This seems undesirable but I didn't look into the full story there and instead just explained this and marked it as provided scope for that one module.\r\n\r\nLog output is dramatically reduced now thanks to the default behavior of test scoped slf4j-simple.\r\n\r\nAnyway this should be in much better shape.  The integration tests seem fairly flakey in multiple local runs but they are able to pass most of the time.  And now we should see why it fails instead of being buried in noisy logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2081686050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2081686592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8708#issuecomment-2081686592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8708","id":2081686592,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM58FARA","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-28T22:52:41Z","updated_at":"2024-04-28T22:52:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"grrr.

At this point the client libraries have stabilized greatly and us supporting the older stuff feels far less important and worthwhile now.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to tease out all of the business logic from the existing processor set. Some logic is there because of actual user need, and some is there because of the way Kafka and NiFi evolved alongside each other. It seems like the happy path works well for the new components, but not sure about all of the possible runtime permutations.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, we’re only talking about the 2.6 processor set; the previous implementations aren’t available in the development executable. It does seem like a good idea to stop investing in enhancements to the 2.6 processors. The 2.6 work in this PR is only scaffolding, intended to better understand runtime processor behavior so it can be reproduced in the new components.\r\n\r\nThe concern for me is that if we drop the 2.6 set as part of this PR, we’ll make things harder for users during the transition period, in case some important edge case is missed. It would also complicate this PR. I’d like to pitch the idea of a transition period where both sets of components exist, to facilitate transition, and to provide a simple fallback if needed.  Longer term, it makes a lot of sense for 2.6 to go the way of 2.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2090939791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2090978880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8463#issuecomment-2090978880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8463","id":2090978880,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM58oc5A","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T16:28:32Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T16:28:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@greyp9 Yeah that is fair.

The module structure has been refactored since you opened the PR.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that MonitorActivity's logic has been changed a bit:\r\n- original version: processor restart resets the state\r\n- new version: inactive state preserved upon restart\r\n\r\nI suggest introducing a new property: `Reset State on Restart` (or similar) with default value `true` in order to keep the original behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2095427711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2095492030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8726#issuecomment-2095492030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8726","id":2095492030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM585qu-","user":{"login":"simonbence","id":61191107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTkxMTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61191107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-06T08:54:53Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the follow up @bbende ! On my side I see only one open topic, the matter of input validation. As I mentioned I do not have very strong opinion about the matter but it would seem safer to add some further refinement to deal with the incoming argument.
