I'm happy to discuss possible solutions for this task since I was thinking a lot about how should this be implemented properly.\r\n\r\nI was also considering the constructor parameter solution, my main concern was that usually when we are creating a `Record` ( e.g. through a `RecordReader`) we don't know how other components would like to use it so we can't determine if it should be created in case-sensitive or insensitive way. Possible solution could be if it is modifiable on the `Record` and maybe track the state with a boolean. \r\n\r\nPossible solution with the current approach could be if we set the original case-sensitive `Map` to be also **lazy-initialized**. This would solve the duplicated storing issue. There could be further restriction added so only one type of map can be initialized at once but both could be supported if needed.\r\n\r\nI can also see further improvements in the current `SimpleRecordSchema` implementation in terms of memory usage. Currently it stores the schema fields in a `List` (**fields**) and also in a `Map` (**fieldMap**) where the key is the name of the record field and the value is the `RecordField` object. Since the `RecordField` object is stored twice it could be changed to store the index of the `RecordField` in the field list as the map's value instead of the RecordField itself.\r\n\r\nI agree on moving this only to the `SimplRecordeSchema` implementation if we don't want to add this on interface level.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion about these?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1905894244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1906081709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8152#issuecomment-1906081709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8152","id":1906081709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5xnH-t","user":{"login":"simonbence","id":61191107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTkxMTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61191107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-23T13:42:16Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T13:42:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks for making the updates @simonbence.\r\n> \r\n> On closer review of the test changes, there is still a problem with manager tests not cleaning up temporary files on completion. Disabling the methods on Windows masks this problem, but running the tests on macOS shows `junit` directories left behind after completion. I recommend removing the `DisabledOnOS` annotations and tracking down the source of the problem. Whether in the test class, or the implementation itself, temporary files should not remain after successful test completion.\r\n> \r\n> I also noticed several QuestDB table definitions that still use `capturedAt` as the column name, so this should be checked across the set of changes and updated.\r\n\r\nI take a look on the leftover temporary files.\r\n\r\nAs for disable: It was a deliberate choice after looking into the reasons. I picked adding them due to the test setup, not because of production reasons. In order to emulate corrupted database files I directly touch the files and write some gibberish into that. This is something normally would happened outside of our code, most reasonably would happen within the database. I did not found other way to trigger this however Windows does not let one to touch a file is under lock by an other process. If there is an other way to deliberatly corrupt the database (not directly working with the underlying files) than it could work out, but I am not aware of such a method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1906081709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1906159835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8273#issuecomment-1906159835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8273","id":1906159835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5xnbDb","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-23T14:22:01Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T14:43:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm not sure how this will translate over to the new UI work that's currently in-progress, but I'll gladly take responsibility for adding it there as well.\r\n\r\nHey @sardell 👋 Thanks for the PR!

I've added a line item and sub-task to NIFI-12400 and will begin work shortly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1907023978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1907356923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8152#issuecomment-1907356923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8152","id":1907356923,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5xr_T7","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T04:27:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T04:27:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Thanks for making the updates @simonbence.\r\n> > On closer review of the test changes, there is still a problem with manager tests not cleaning up temporary files on completion. Disabling the methods on Windows masks this problem, but running the tests on macOS shows `junit` directories left behind after completion. I recommend removing the `DisabledOnOS` annotations and tracking down the source of the problem. Whether in the test class, or the implementation itself, temporary files should not remain after successful test completion.\r\n> > I also noticed several QuestDB table definitions that still use `capturedAt` as the column name, so this should be checked across the set of changes and updated.\r\n> \r\n> I take a look on the leftover temporary files.\r\n> \r\n> As for disable: It was a deliberate choice after looking into the reasons. I picked adding them due to the test setup, not because of production reasons. In order to emulate corrupted database files I directly touch the files and write some gibberish into that. This is something normally would happened outside of our code, most reasonably would happen within the database. I did not found other way to trigger this however Windows does not let one to touch a file is under lock by an other process. If there is an other way to deliberatly corrupt the database (not directly working with the underlying files) than it could work out, but I am not aware of such a method.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into the details. Manual file changes for the test methods seems like a reasonable strategy, so if you can track down and resolve the leftover files issue, I would expect that should also resolve the test failures on Windows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1907356923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1908147523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8274#issuecomment-1908147523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8274","id":1908147523,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5xvAVD","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T13:41:55Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T13:41:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged to support branch in https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/89ba16a09a6efdef70d60551462d3f4f95195328","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1908147523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1908258979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8094#issuecomment-1908258979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8094","id":1908258979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5xvbij","user":{"login":"Lehel44","id":7498857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTg4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7498857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44","html_url":"https://github.com/Lehel44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lehel44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T14:36:42Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T14:36:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @markap14 @exceptionfactory.

I went through the code and unit tests, as well did some manual testing and verifying property migrations. The changes made to the JsonWriter appear to function as intended.\r\n\r\nOne concern is that while the changes to the JsonWriter fixed the scientific notation problem, the RecordReader still uses scientific notation by default. This mismatch could cause unexpected issues when using both components together. In my tests, I noticed that the `WriteJsonResult::writeRecord` received records in scientific notation, which might not be what users expect. To avoid confusion and ensure consistency, it would be wise to update the RecordReader to match the changes made to the JsonWriter.
