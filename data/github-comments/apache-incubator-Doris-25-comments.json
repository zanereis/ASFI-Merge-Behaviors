It will have two log entry for one entry in fe.audit.log. When receiving the query, the end_time/state/profile is null. After finished, It will updated.\r\n\r\nSchema 3:\r\n     Doris FE cached query detail in memory for fixed number query, for example 10000. Doris Fe provided a HTTP interface to get the query detail.

As a conclusion, the http server is based on libevent , which use reactor model to process http request, some http requests are processed by one thread.  it assumes that every process function in

will affect the following stream load, which cannot be processed in time. \r\n\r\nSo This PR manily add some mertics to trace the Potential bottlenecks when stream load get bad performance. and change

But there always are some long tail task in our online environment, once a task is executed slowly, it will block all the http request on the same thread . So change the thread from 5 to 48 can reduce the extra time cost for waiting slow task to complete, because we use rpc call and furture get function in reactor model thread.(The real improvement for us is that http request for metric never timeout now when we change the thread num from 5 to 42 in our online environment)\r\nIt is hard for us to write non blocking code in libevent callback function
