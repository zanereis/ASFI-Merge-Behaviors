all the changes here, the most compelling one is the change made to `GraphSONTypeIdResolver` (the rest occur in methods that I don't think get called frequently enough to really make a noticeable impact in performance - just guessing from a cursory glance at this PR).  You provided a small general benchmark which is nice, but could you please specifically do a benchmark over the `GraphSONTypeIdResolver` to see what kind of performance improvement we get there as a result of this?\r\n\r\nYou can try to benchmark the it directly but you could probably also just instantiate a `ObjectMapper` for GraphSON 3.0 and fire a bunch of different GraphSON types at it in succession to do the benchmark.  Just an example with a `Vertex` - the full list of GraphSON types is [here](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.3.4/dev/io/)\r\n\r\n```text\r\ngremlin> mapper =
