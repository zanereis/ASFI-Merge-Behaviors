for taking a look @mengxr.  Working on a patch that addresses the inline comments.  On the broader points:\n\n> We should spend more time on the data types.\n\nAgreed. It would probably make sense to have some way of accepting sparse input, maybe just Map[Int, T]?\n\n> Using Array to store features would result reallocation of memory.\n\nDo you mind elaborating on this a little more?  How can we avoid the reallocation?\n\n> The output of one-hot is always sparse, we should use sparse vector instead of dense.\n\nWhile one-hot increases the sparsity, in many cases a dense representation is still more efficient.  I'm not sure where the boundary lies, but, in the extreme case, a long dense vector with few categorical variables that take on only a few categories will still do better with a dense representation after the transformation.  In my opinion, we should give the user control and default to only outputting sparse vectors if the input type is sparse.  What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40303204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40303293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/376#issuecomment-40303293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/376","id":40303293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzAzMjkz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-13T09:24:06Z","updated_at":"2014-04-13T09:24:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40303293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/40303294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/360#issuecomment-40303294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/360","id":40303294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzAzMjk0","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-13T09:24:07Z","updated_at":"2014-04-13T09:24:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

So we would expect there to be no relevant performance loss of this synchronization in this case, except perhaps for very small streams which are completed before being biased.\n\nHowever, the API of `def toByteArray: Array[Byte]` and `def toArray: (Array[Byte], Int)` with different performance characteristics is pretty strange.

at our usages of ByteBuffer#array in Spark, most of them do not handle ByteBuffers where capacity != limit correctly. This change could turn these oversights into actual bugs, if the ByteBuffers returned here are used later as inputs. See TachyonStore for an example, where all the logging and accounting looks at limit(), but the actual bytes used will be capacity().\n\nThis change also has the behavior of actually storing up to 2x the amount of bytes as actual data, since before we could throw away the backing array and just keep the data. After all, the original solution using fastutil just called trim(), which means it wasn't really faster than ByteArrayOutputStream, but it did preserve the safety and memory characteristics that this implementation does not have.\n\nThis change makes the most sense for RawTextSender, where we immediately turn around and write the bytes to a stream, so we don't need to store them and hope no one misuses it later. It makes less sense when we actually want ByteBuffers later -- I think a copy is really the only reasonable solution there. \n\nThe ideal solution in terms of API might actually just be @srowen's suggestion:\n\n```\nclass FastByteArrayOutputStream extends ByteArrayOutputStream {\n   def getUnderlyingArray: Array[Byte]\n}\n```\n\nThe only downside is that this still has the synchronized behavior which may or may not be impactful, but it saves 100 lines of code and would allow RawTextSender to go without a copy. As fasr as I can tell, neither Task nor Serializer really benefited from the fastutil FastByteArrayOutputStream as both copied the data anyway.
