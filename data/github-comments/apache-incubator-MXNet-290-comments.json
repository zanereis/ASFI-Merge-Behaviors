Perhaps this is something I am not understanding very well (the way to properly use hybridize call in a unified way both with Symbol and NDArray). I've just started learning Gluon + mxnet. \r\n\r\nYour solution works (I actually have this solution to my code) when the ```_input``` variable is an NDArray type. But then I want a unified way of finding the shape at runtime both if I feed in an NDArray or a Symbol.

And to my understanding, I need to know the input layer size, so I can infer correct proposals for kernel/stride sizes in the ```F.Pooling``` operator. The point is, I want to test/debug with NDArray and then call hybridize for efficient computations. \r\n\r\nAgain thank you very much for your answer.  \r\n\r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355186696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355189033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9294#issuecomment-355189033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9294","id":355189033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTE4OTAzMw==","user":{"login":"gamenn","id":35082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgyNzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn","html_url":"https://github.com/gamenn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gamenn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-04T03:13:53Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T19:13:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhreshold What exactly are the path variable names MXNet looks for?

I searched online to set MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE to 0 to disable and updated my mxnet to 1.0.0., since some say this version will resolve the MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE issue. However, after updating, my R is still crashing when using ResNet or VGG. Meanwhile, transfer learning using Inception does not crash. I am wondering if there is an internal bug in mxnet R to cause this issue.

No problem with ResNet34 or 50, but it got problematic with 101. Have you looked at the GPU usage immediatly after launching the training (nvidia-smi) to confirm you have same issue? \r\n\r\nI also noticed apparent memory leak when running large embeddings. A quick turnaround is to add a gc() within the training loop after each couple of batch (not necessary to add a gc() within the eval data loop). You can do it either in `mx.model.FeedForward.create` or `mx.model.buckets` (I only used the later but should work for the usual training function). Good news is that it doesn't slow down noticeably the training and finetune ResNet101 wasn't crashing anymore and GPU memory remained below 4Go on 8 samples. \r\n\r\n@thirdwing Any idea whether this memory issue could better be handled than with gc()? If performance isn't affected, I wonder if a quick PR with the gc() would be worth. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355477039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355477273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4817#issuecomment-355477273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4817","id":355477273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTQ3NzI3Mw==","user":{"login":"jeremiedb","id":18605903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjA1OTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18605903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremiedb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T05:40:09Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T05:40:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lichen11, please see answer in #7968","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/355477273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
