on last commit: In TVM when we have a CHECK* macro, the program exits when a condition is not satisfied. When we call tensorize on a given loop, if that loop is not tensorizable with the given intrinsic one of these CHECK calls fail and we exit TVM. However, in autotensorization, we need to check all iteration variables, and when one of the checks fail for a given iteration variable, we need to go on to the next iteration variable (and not exit TVM). That's why I needed a new type of CHECK* macros (called COND_CHECK*) that can either quit, return false, or do anything else when their condition is false.\r\nI'm not picky about the name of the new macros, or the name of the new variables, or anything else, as long as I get the functionality I need.

I have tried rfactor and it works. With modification in schedule:\r\n```\r\nko, ki = s[B].split(k, 4)\r\nB_rfactor = s.rfactor(B, ki)    \r\ns[B_rfactor].compute_at(s[B], s[B].op.axis[0])\r\n```\r\nThe output result is what I expect. Now the lower IR turns into this:\r\n```\r\nrealize B([0, 12]) {\r\n  produce B {\r\n    for (ax0, 0, 12) {\r\n      // attr [compute(B.rf, 0x1204368)] realize_scope = \"\"\r\n      realize B.rf([0, 4], [ax0, 1]) {\r\n        produce B.rf {\r\n          for (k.inner, 0, 4) {\r\n            B.rf(k.inner, (0 + ax0)) =0.000000f\r\n            for (k.outer, 0, 16) {\r\n              B.rf(k.inner, (0 + ax0)) =(B.rf(k.inner, (0 + ax0)) + A((0 + ax0), (k.inner + (k.outer*4))))\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        B(ax0) =0.000000f\r\n        for (k.inner.v, 0, 4) {\r\n          B(ax0) =(B(ax0) + B.rf(k.inner.v, ax0))\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI tried to tensorize the k.inner and the k.outer.v, it failed. \r\nThe reason is that rfactor move the rfactor_axis to first dimension, and the shape of new tensor B.rf is [rfactor, axo]. Tensorize with intrinsic shape [rfactor] would not success.\r\nThe shape of B.rf cause similar problem for the tensorize of k.outer.v\r\nI think there are two solution:\r\n1. allow using rfactor without moving rfactor_axis to first dimension\r\n1. enhance tensorize to match [n, m, 1] -> [n, m]. while currently the tensorize only allow the match [1, n, m]->[n, m] \r\n\r\nDo you have other better suggestions?

I'll keep the macro as is and will find a solution for the lint problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/362847030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/362849916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/869#issuecomment-362849916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/869","id":362849916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mjg0OTkxNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-03T20:03:17Z","updated_at":"2018-02-03T20:03:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let us add regression tests so these problem can be detected in the topi test ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/362849916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/362883405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/856#issuecomment-362883405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/856","id":362883405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mjg4MzQwNQ==","user":{"login":"yajiedesign","id":771744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTc0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign","html_url":"https://github.com/yajiedesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-04T06:01:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T06:02:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/EXPORT:`__tvm_main__`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/362883405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/362911663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/870#issuecomment-362911663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/870","id":362911663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjkxMTY2Mw==","user":{"login":"alex-weaver","id":11133789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMzNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11133789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-weaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-04T14:44:42Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T14:44:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not sure why the test is failing -

have encountered a problem that is essentially blocking OpenGL codegen.\r\n\r\nIf we write this program:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nm = 2\r\nn = 2\r\np = 2\r\nA = tvm.placeholder((m, n, p), name='A', dtype=\"int32\")\r\nB = tvm.compute((m, n, p), lambda *i: A[i], name=\"B\")\r\n\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))\r\ns[B].opengl()\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis program lowers to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nB[(((((threadIdx.x/4)*2) + ((threadIdx.x/2) % 2))*2) + (threadIdx.x % 2))] = A[(((((threadIdx.x/4)*2) + ((threadIdx.x/2) % 2))*2) + (threadIdx.x % 2))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it actually should be simplified to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nB[threadIdx.x] = A[threadIdx.x]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the following 2 programs can be properly simplified:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 2D tensor\r\nm = 2\r\nn = 2\r\nA = tvm.placeholder((m, n), name='A', dtype=\"int32\")\r\nB = tvm.compute((m, n), lambda *i: A[i], name=\"B\")\r\n\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))\r\ns[B].opengl()\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 3D tensor but with variable shape\r\nm = tvm.var(\"m\")\r\nn = tvm.var(\"n\")\r\np = tvm.var(\"p\")\r\nA = tvm.placeholder((m, n, p), name='A', dtype=\"int32\")\r\nB = tvm.compute((m, n, p), lambda *i: A[i], name=\"B\")\r\n\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))\r\ns[B].opengl()\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI figured out that the reason is that `StorageFlatten` is not smart enough to simplify the index expression.\r\n\r\nI think currently I can work around this by adding some kind of attribute which says \"threadIdx.x maps to the corresponding element in the output tensor\", and then directly putting `B[threadIdx.x]` in `StorageFlatten`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/363214236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/363226099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/836#issuecomment-363226099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/836","id":363226099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzIyNjA5OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T21:24:31Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T21:24:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We
