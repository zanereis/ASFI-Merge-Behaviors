Currently, some tools do not accept this format so you may not always be able to use this technique. For example, `jar -xf` may silently fail to extract a jar or war that has been made fully-executable. It is recommended that you only make your jar or war fully executable if you intend to execute it directly, rather than running it with `java -jar` or deploying it to a servlet container.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I thought the Cloud Foundry Java buildpack did not support these because it tries to unpack the JAR before running it, but it appears that with the latest version of the Java buildpack, it has no problem running these.

I thought this'd be a quick Google search, adopting things a bit for the specifics of our case, open PR, all good. Nope, changing HTML is apparently not simple.\r\n\r\nMy first approach was extending the `config.json` we generate, and injecting the `<base>` tag from JS. The server side is clean, adding a new config value is trivial. BUT: of course the JS that'd load `config.json` won't know where to load the file from, because the `<base>` tag is not set. 🐔 and 🥚 , you see.\r\n\r\nMy second approach was to do exactly what was originally described: rewrite the HTML content. Apparently \"the way\" to do that is with ServletFilters, which... I tried to do, got something that _might_ work, but I don't see how I'd inject the new filter from the context of the autoconfigure module. Sounds like a horrible idea anyway.\r\n\r\nIs the \"right\" way to just ... change https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-autoconfigure/ui/src/main/java/zipkin/autoconfigure/ui/ZipkinUiAutoConfiguration.java#L118 into a method returning `ResponseEntity<String>`, read the HTML file _like a peasant_, and do the HTML parsing / mutation, then pass a string to the `ResponseEntity`?
