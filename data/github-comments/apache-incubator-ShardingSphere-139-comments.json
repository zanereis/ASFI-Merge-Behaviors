There are 2 possible solutions for now:\r\n\r\n1, Get resultSetMetaData from queryResponse.queryResults, use PostgreSQL's implementation PgResultSetMetaData, get field of column index via java reflection, then get type oid. The disadvantage is: a) direct dependency of postgresql jdbc driver, b) once the internal implementation of PostgreSQL jdbc driver changed, then it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n2, Get resultSetMetaData from queryResponse.queryResults, use getColumnTypeName(column) method to get database specific type name (e.g. integer array is _int4), then translate it to type oid (e.g. 1007), PostgreSQL has the mapping definition.\r\n\r\nI prefer solution 2, though it need more
