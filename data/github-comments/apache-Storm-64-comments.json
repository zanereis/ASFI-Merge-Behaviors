chintalapani</a> I wanted to check with you guys if the following approach makes sense to support this feature I tried to do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Added an API in StormSubmitter , <b>submitTopologyAs</b> which takes all the usual params + String doAsUser.</li>\n\t<li>Authenticate using the keytab in the jaas.conf.</li>\n\t<li>Create a new subject using the doAsUser as the principal, make the server side call as a privileged action with this subject.\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">Nimbus.Client client = NimbusClient.getConfiguredClient(conf).getClient();\nUser proxyUser = <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> User(doAsUser);\nSubject subject = <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> Subject();\nsubject.getPrincipals().add(proxyUser);\nSubject.doAs(subject, <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> PrivilegedAction<<span class=\"code-object\">Object</span>>() {\n    @Override\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"code-object\">Object</span> run() {\nclient.submitTopology(args);\n    }\n})\n</pre>\n</div></div></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I originally thought sasl would forward the principal from the current thread context's subject to the server but on the server side <b>String authId = saslServer.getAuthorizationID();</b> still returns the original authenticated Id that was sent as part of connection establishment. </p>\n\n<p>I dont want to modify all the APIs to include a UserGroupInfomration look-a-like param but looking at the hadoop implementation it seems hadoop also passes the UGI as part of the RPC call that they make. Do you guys have any other alternative ideas that does not involve changing all the thrift APIS?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612483360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612483367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4288#issuecomment-2612483367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4288","id":2612483367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0ODMzNjc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-24T01:30:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:02:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sriharsha\">sriharsha</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=parth.brahmbhatt\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"parth.brahmbhatt\">Parth Brahmbhatt</a>   As you said saslServer.getAuthorizationID() will get the initial authID and  don't think there is a way to submit other user credentials once the initial sasl connection setup. </p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to add a single thriftApi that takes in UGI and a operation i.e uploadTopology ,rebalance etc and on the server side does this as the UGI?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612483367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612528184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4528#issuecomment-2612528184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4528","id":2612528184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MjgxODQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-24T02:23:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:26:14Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user harshach opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/440\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/440</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-687\" title=\"Storm UI does not display up to date information despite refreshes in IE.\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-687\"><del>STORM-687</del></a>.

We already have a list of admin users , so as part of impersonation I can check that the user trying to impersonate is in the admin user list. Alternatively I can follow hadoop/hbase config and add following 2 configs:<br/>\nstorm.impersonation.userX.groups: <span class=\"error\">&#91;list of groups userX is allowed to impersonate&#93;</span><br/>\nstorm.impersonation.userX.hosts<span class=\"error\">&#91;list of hosts from which userX is allowed to impersonate&#93;</span></p>\n\n<p>I like the second option as due to finer granularity it provides more security however it also requires extra configuration. Let me know what you guys think.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612483390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/75878755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/429#issuecomment-75878755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/429","id":75878755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODc4NzU1","user":{"login":"danielschonfeld","id":522598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/danielschonfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielschonfeld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-25T00:05:36Z","updated_at":"2015-02-25T00:05:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptgoetz

class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"revans2\">Robert Joseph Evans</a> Ok I will go ahead with the second approach but I am running into another SASL API detail. I only get the authenticatedId and authorizationId when the AuthrizationCallBack occurs, once the callback returns the server seem to only record authrizedId which is what it returns when we call <b>saslServer.getAuthorizationID()</b> and there is no <b>saslServer.getAuthenticationID()</b> API.</p>\n\n<p>I also considered doing the impersonation authorization as part of AuthorizationCallback itself, but there is no way to access client ip/hostName as the callback only gets authenticationId and authorizationId and no socket information and this information is not known at the time of Callback initialization. </p>\n\n<p>If you know the workaround on top of your head let me know.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612483401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612528306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4529#issuecomment-2612528306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4529","id":2612528306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MjgzMDY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-25T21:13:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:26:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
