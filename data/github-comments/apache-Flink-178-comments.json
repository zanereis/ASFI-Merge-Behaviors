I agree that the (2) approach is probably less brittle. Additionally we would get rid of the timeout identifier generation.\r\n\r\n- I think it is fair to assume that the number of slots don't change over the lifetime of a `TaskManager`.

Just the question with how well this works for the general use case, because then implementations of the new `partition` method need to handle different topics (which probably makes sense because we want to generally treat topics as dynamic anyways ..; we should probably have a final confirmation from @gyfora how well this works, since he proposed this change in the first place). The new way can also allow us to handle upscaled target topics in the future.\r\n\r\nFor migration, for the dummy wrapper delegation, I think we should just mimc the wrong, old behaviour.

Originally, I thought it would be possible to register state (i.e., the `MapState` for the distinct values) in an `AggregateFunction` (which is used for the grouped window aggregates). However, that's unfortunately not possible as I learned today. All state of an `AggregateFunction` must be contained in the accumulator.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? We cannot use the current approach of registering `MapState` in the code-gen'd function for group windowed aggregates.

For example, this is the new `*From12` tests rebased on the master branch: https://github.com/aljoscha/flink/tree/jira-5969-backwards-compat-12-13.

Second, I pushed a branch with the state in the process function using the code generated process function. Then, third I moved the state within the code generated function. \r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me why the state cannot be within the code generated function. Could you please clarify so that we can understand whether it is worth working around it. This feature is quite important for us.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you could have a look at the branch that uses the state in the process function and uses the code generated aggregation functions. Basically, rather than generate one code generated function for all the aggregations, I create one class for each, and then I call the corresponding accumulate/retract using the distinct logic when marked in the process function.

However, this does not work because we cannot register state for an AggregateFunction. The benefit of the approach of #3771 would have been that it does not need to deserialize the Map every time a record is accumulated (or retracted). Instead the distinct values are kept in a MapState that can be accessed (and deserialized) per look up key. But this approach does not work with the AggregateFunction that we use for early aggregation. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm a bit concerned about the performance of the approach of this PR because the  state of the DistinctAccumulator accumulator (i.e., the complete map) will be de/serialized every time we access it. \r\n\r\nI think we can use this approach for now, but should look out, whether we can use an approach similar to the batch side where distinct aggregations (on different keys) are translated into multiple aggregations which are later joined together (the join would be rather cheap because its a 1-to-1 join).\r\n\r\nI'll have a look at this PR later today.\r\nThanks, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/297932526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/297933658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3560#issuecomment-297933658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3560","id":297933658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzkzMzY1OA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T07:56:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T07:56:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you close this PR as well @sunjincheng121?\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/297933658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/297938610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3790#issuecomment-297938610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3790","id":297938610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzkzODYxMA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T08:22:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T08:22:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not sure whether marking classes without abstract methods abstract makes sense.

Communicated with DD engineers, they fixed the issue, and now, as advised by them,  I'm making 'host' a separate field in metric serialization. Tested the new approach successfully, and we are able to filter metrics by 'host' consistently correctly on DD dashboard.\r\n2) Added more unit tests for the above change. Unit tests cover both cases when 'host' is present in MetricGroup and when it isn't\r\n3) Found Maven can only recognize and run unit tests when file name ends with 'Test' rather than 'Tests'. So I renamed my test file to 'DatadogHttpClientTest' from 'DatadogHttpClientTests'\r\n4) Upgraded okhttp and okio to newer versions\r\n5) Found mocking system millisec will impact the new okhttp. So I separated unit tests to two enclosed test sets in 'DatadogHttpClientTest' \r\n\r\nHaving successfully tested this across my company in the past couple days, I'm now pretty confident this is production ready. \r\n\r\nI agree on @zentol 's proposal if you guys are currently busy with other things, as long as we make sure this ends up in 1.3 :)  Thanks, guys!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298093000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/298117255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3799#issuecomment-298117255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3799","id":298117255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODExNzI1NQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-28T22:04:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T22:04:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @twalthr for taking care of this!\r\nMost of the files have been copied from the Calcite master, so I won't review those.

You mentioned and it looks like that incremental snapshots cannot be rescaled as it checkpoints the files directly for multiple keygroups together. How is this constraint enforced?

How do you plan for users to trigger the incremental snapshot operation? I guess the question goes both for checkpoints and savepoints. For example every n-th checkpoint is a full snapshot.
