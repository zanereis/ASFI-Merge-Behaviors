I thought it may caused by my codes, so I tried to use official PySpark examples, the bugs still occurred. This is the code I used. https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/blob/master/examples/src/main/python/pi_app.py\r\n**Note:** I comment the last line # client.stop(True), cause I won't want to close the session after submitting just one job. The details about this bug are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. When I use default yarn mode, that is \"yarn\", official PySpark examples and programmatic API work well. Using Livy interpreter in Zeppelin will throw  exception:` NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.spark.ui.SparkUI.appUIAddress()` for the spark master.\r\n\r\n2. ThenI change the yarn mode into \"yarn-cluster\" as SivaKaviyappa suggested, Zeppelin works well. But the logs of this statement will hav a warning: `\"Warning: Master yarn-cluster is deprecated since 2.0. Please use master \\\"yarn\\\" with specified deploy mode instead.`\r\nHowever, Using programmatic API will have such bug:  \r\n\r\n  2.1  I delete all Livy sessions, and run pi_app.py. It throw such exception:  \r\n```\r\nReadTimeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='172.31.5.251', port=8998): Read timed out. (read timeout=10)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ec2-user/wandongwu/livy_test_9/pi_app.py\", line 35, in <module>\r\n    pi = client.submit(pi_job).result()\r\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/concurrent/futures/_base.py\", line 462, in result\r\n    return self.__get_result()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/concurrent/futures/_base.py\", line 414, in __get_result\r\n    raise exception_type, self._exception, self._traceback\r\nTypeError: raise: arg 3 must be a traceback or None\r\n```\r\nBut I find It has started a new Livy session.
