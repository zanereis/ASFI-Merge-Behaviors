Once used to bootstrap, the node information is all replaced with the current metadata, and then refreshed periodically. \n\nThe benefit of the fix is that it allows the client to start if any one of the bootstrap servers are resolvable. We might have a connectivity problem to a single node when we actually start to send messages, but this can be fixed through the usual refresh cycle of the metadata as and when the system as a whole becomes aware of the issue. \n\nIt reduces the impact of a single bad DNS record from preventing the client to start, to bad connectivity to a single broker, until the DNS problem is resolved - or the metadata is updated to include a new broker with a better DNS entry.\n\nPreventing the startup of the client because of one bad dns entry when there are others which are usable seems overly restrictive.  If there are no servers resolvable the client should be prevented from starting and throwing the relevant exception.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/173982008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/173986975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/792#issuecomment-173986975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/792","id":173986975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mzk4Njk3NQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T17:33:56Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T17:33:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bondj There is a discussion about using the bootstrap servers after initialisation under some failure scenarios in KAFKA-3068.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/173986975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/173994676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/800#issuecomment-173994676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/800","id":173994676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mzk5NDY3Ng==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T18:03:39Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T18:03:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap The last commit has left some unused imports causing Jenkins to fail.

A few high level comments.\n1. In OfflinePartitionLeaderSelector, if we can't find a new live leader (whether due to unclean leader election being disabled or not), it seems it's better to set the new leader to -1, instead of throwing an exception and leave the old leader in ZK. We need to make sure that the rest of the logic continues to work with a -1 leader. For example, if a follower receives a -1 leader, it probably should stop fetching from the current leader, but not start fetching again. Currently, in ReplicaManager.makeFollowers(), it seems that if the new leader is -1, we don't complete the follower transition and therefore don't stop the fetching from the current leader.\n2. This is related to the issue in KAFKA-3143. Currently, if a follower goes down, the logic to remove this replica from ISR is handled by transitioning the replica to OfflineReplica in ReplicaStateMachine. However, this logic is not called during controller failover. Suppose that broker 1 is a follower for a partition and is also the controller. If we hard kill broker 1 (therefore doesn't trigger the controlled shutdown logic), the new controller won't remove replica 1 from ISR. Instead, it relies on the leader to take replica 1 out of ISR after replica.lag.time.max.ms. Ideally, the new controller should shrink the ISR during initialization since this can be faster than waiting for the leader timeout. It seems that during the controller failover, we should also transition failed replicas to OfflineReplica too.

And as @apovzner mentioned by just setting the wrapper message as the max value of all inner message timestamps and letting consumer check if wrapper timestamp is the max value does not perfectly work since 1) it requires the consumers to always decompress the whole message before returning any to the user, hence restricting buffer memory management we wanted to add in the future, 2) there is a corner case that if LogAppendTime is used and broker overrides the wrapper timestamp, it happens to be the same as the max of inner timestamps.\n\nI think we can add this information into the attribute field of the message, which currently only used 2 bits for four different compression types; instead we can make it a mask manner where the first 3 (or if we want to be safer, use 4) bits are preserved for indicating compression codec, leaves us a total of 8 (or 16) supported compression types, and use the forth (fifth) bit for indicating if the wrapper timestamp (for LogAppendTime, hence it is overridden) or the inner timestamp (for LogCreationTime) should be used to set the consumer record's timestamp.\n\nAnd with this neither producer nor consumer needs to learn about this per-topic config from metadata responses, which makes the client change simpler, and other languages' adoption easier.\n- I am curious if the ducktape integration tests will be added in another PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/174748282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/174759962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/764#issuecomment-174759962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/764","id":174759962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDc1OTk2Mg==","user":{"login":"becketqin","id":5778611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5778611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin","html_url":"https://github.com/becketqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T01:32:12Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T01:38:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang Using attribute field is a good approach. It also lets consumers know the timestamp type. To make sure I understand your suggestion correctly:\n1. The producer simply send message assuming the broker is using CreateTime. i.e. both attributes and timestamp will be using CreateTime.\n2. If log append time is used, the broker only overrides the outer message's Attribute field and Timestmap field to use LogAppendTime\n3. When consumer sees the message, it checks both magic as well as attribute field to see which timestamp is used (if magic > 0), and then decide whether it will override the inner message's timestamp or not.\n\nAnother thing is that we still need to decompress the entire compressed message, because of the reason I mentioned in one of the comments. Given the stream compression used by producer, we will not have a actual \"relative offset compared with last message\" until we close the batch. Instead, we only have the \"relative offset compared with the first message\" when we write a message into a batch.
