It cannot be interrupted when the transition is received,and the only option is to wait it out.\r\nJackie's change in #4338 is being evaluated in production, and yes, if it works, this change is not needed for performance. But it *is* needed for freshness. Otherwise, for a use case that takes order of  mins to build a segment we will be serving stale data in the meantime.\r\nThis change has already been tried out in production, and the results are promising.\r\n\r\nYes, it will create additional load on the controllers (actually, on the storage). That is why this is a table configuration, to be turned on in tables on a need-basis that satisfy multiple conditions. In our produciton scenarios. we have not felt the need for any table other than one, for this feature. The one table has 10 replicas, a very high qps and low latency requirement (< 100ms in 99th percentile), low memory foot-print, and takes minutes to build segments. We have tried out other things like building segments sooner, etc. didn't work.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to let the controller decide whether a server should be downoading the segment or building one. In the initial version it will be a brute-force \"DISCARD\" return from the controller, which causes the server to just download the segment. In the medium term (or even in the first PR) we can have the controller return KEEP for 50% of the hosts, and DISCARD for the other 50%. In future, we can make more intelligent decisions.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504108545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504112450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4346#issuecomment-504112450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4346","id":504112450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDExMjQ1MA==","user":{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T17:25:11Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T17:25:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for implementing this, will review it today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504112450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504121705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4317#issuecomment-504121705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4317","id":504121705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDEyMTcwNQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T17:53:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T17:53:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kishoreg once you get the feature in, if you move to use the existing Buffer class, won't it be incompatbile?

I need a ship-it from one of you\r\n\r\nI have not addressed most of the comments by @mayankshriv which will be in the implementation of VarLengthBytesValueReaderWriter.   Basically, my proposal is to build mutable and immutable versions of OffHeapByteArrayStore. Either we can derive two classes out of this and use them, or we can play around with the ctor of OffHeapByteArraystore to make it independent of memory manager etc. (caller allocates) and provide only a pnot-databuffer that is mutable (vs the immutable, which could then becoime an empty constructor with an init call). We can work around these things. All I want is one way to encode strings in a compact fashion. thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504479121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504490358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/2798#issuecomment-504490358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/2798","id":504490358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDQ5MDM1OA==","user":{"login":"israbbani","id":7349323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDkzMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7349323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani","html_url":"https://github.com/israbbani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/israbbani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T16:36:58Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T16:36:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504490358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/504507871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4345#issuecomment-504507871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4345","id":504507871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDUwNzg3MQ==","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T17:32:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T17:32:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, agree with adding a parameter in the SegmentCompletionProtocol.Response (instead of new type of status).

My understanding was that there was no reduction happening until data from each processing node was sent to the broker. I mistakenly thought that Combine operator doesn't come into picture up until broker. Thanks for clarifying that. \r\n\r\nSo the broker (1 reducer) will do the final aggregation processing by combining the data across nodes. Right?\r\n\r\nAnother reason behind thinking of two-phase was that for low cardinality but high volume data set, if we can reduce everything at the segment server level (with a shuffle), then less data will be sent to broker. All of the execution specific operator logic can be kept in the segment server and broker need not worry about running out of memory and crashing while doing the final processing -- it can still while doing the union but there we can just use limit. Similarly, the segment servers can support spilling etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/506191736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/506207899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4219#issuecomment-506207899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4219","id":506207899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjIwNzg5OQ==","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-27T06:17:53Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T06:17:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe using Calcite can prove to be useful in the long run as we converge closer to standard SQL support and achieving parity with general OLAP systems.

This test was generating its own test data and I tweaked it to account for generating time column values within acceptable range. Similarly, the unit test I added to test the newly added code in SegmentGenerationWithTimeColumnTest  also piggy-backed on the random data generation in the test code. These tests first put the dummy data in a list of GenericRow and create a record reader with the schema and generic row set. Later SegmentIndexCreationDriver is initialized with the record reader for dummy data\r\n\r\nHowever, many others like IntArraysTest, ColumnMetadataTest, SegmentMetadataImplTest, SegmentPrepropcessorTest seem to be reading the test data from avro file and thus there is no control in the test code over the data. SegmentIndexCreationDriver is initialized just with the generation config that internally has details of path to avro test dataset.\r\n\r\nI am wondering how to fix these kinds of tests now that segment generation code does the time column validity check and the input data is in avro file?\r\n\r\nI am still going through rest of the test failures but wanted an opinion w.r.t fixing tests that
