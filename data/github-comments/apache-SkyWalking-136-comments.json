I want to know the aop system performance limit for all samples,\r\n> I want to know the consumption of aop cluster resources and the qps it bears,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, aop should be `OAP`. You have this typo in all your questions.\r\nI think this is nearly impossible to provide official test. These cost a lot of resources, as we don't have that in the Apache foundation. There are some blogs on official website, http://skywalking.apache.org/blog/, posted by some PMC members.

If you learn more about the SkyWalking tracing module and analysis logic, you will know what I am talking about.

But you still have span ref, right? You could propagate it to any thread, and operate it. The core will wait for you to do real async finish.\r\n\r\nAnd the issue you posted is true, I didn't realize it before. I think all similar methods in `#EntrySpan` and `#ExitSpan` should add `setxxxInAsync`(work in `isInAsyncMode==true`) to ignore the `currentMaxDepth` and `stackDepth`. At the same time, `setxxx` should not work in `isInAsyncMode==true`. Make sense?\r\n\r\nIf YES, please submit a new pull request to adjust that. We should add them separately.
