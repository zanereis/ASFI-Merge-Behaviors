Sean.\n\nMulti-class classification and feature importances are important features that will be added soon. We implemented a minimal feature set since we wanted to focus on functional accuracy and (weak and strong) scaling. Now that we are satisfied on that front, I am sure these features will be added soon. It's a fairly big PR in terms of code size so I prefer to avoid adding any more features to the basic implementation.\n\nAlso, we have plans to add ensemble trees (random decision forests, boosting, etc.) soon to mllib.\n\nFinally, even though mllib lacks this functionality just yet, one could always implement a bank of one-versus-all classifiers as a workaround to handle the multi-class classification problem. At the same time, I agree its important to add this functionality to the classification algorithm itself and will be added soon.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36755664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36760892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/83#issuecomment-36760892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/83","id":36760892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzYwODky","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-05T16:24:33Z","updated_at":"2014-03-05T16:24:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged

The way it is now if someone explicitly sets conf values in SparkConf they will be ignored here, which isn't ideal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36762162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36762448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33#issuecomment-36762448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33","id":36762448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzYyNDQ4","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-05T16:35:09Z","updated_at":"2014-03-05T16:35:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah I see from your earlier comment that's still a \"TODO\" perhaps.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36762448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36764964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33#issuecomment-36764964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33","id":36764964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzY0OTY0","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-05T16:54:32Z","updated_at":"2014-03-05T16:54:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes I haven't made that change yet.

In particular, we build a .tar.gz using the maven-assembly-plugin and it contains all the spark jars and dependencies:\nhttps://github.com/apache/bigtop/blob/master/bigtop-packages/src/common/spark/do-component-build#L35\n\nWe then take this tarball distribution and use it in building our rpm/deb packages:\nhttps://github.com/apache/bigtop/blob/master/bigtop-packages/src/common/spark/install_spark.sh#L134\n\nThe goal of that target is to not include any hadoop jars though since those are provided by Bigtop. The bug this PR fixes is that the distribution wasn't including the right assembly jar, so it makes it include the correct assembly uber jar (which in itself contains hadoop jars but that's what SPARK-1064 will fix).\n\nI know of make-distribution.sh but haven't looked much into it since it uses sbt. I can't speak for the whole Bigtop project here but I think most of us integrators are more experienced with maven and therefore prefer it due to the knowledge base and community.

PR is the result of several iterations on the idea of wanting to build fast decision trees for Spark. \n\nTo offer a little more color on the design here, the key ideas are:\n1. Histograms to compute best split statistics. We quantize input attributes and compute best splits via relatively cheap operations on histograms. This is a precision/speed tradeoff in that we give up the ability to find \"perfect\" split points (by the C4.5 algorithm), but still find very close ones.\n2. Minimize total passes over the data by training models \"level-wise\". At each level of the tree, we evaluate which node a point belongs in, and allow the point to contribute to the statistics (histogram bins) for that node only. While the number of histograms is thus exponential with tree depth, these data structures are relatively small and we expect that very deep trees are relatively uncommon (especially in the ensemble case). This also means that we need only cache the working set once, instead of partitioning the data and caching the partitions.\n3. Want to support arbitrary split statistics (e.g. Gini, Entropy, Variance), and both categorical and continuous input and response values - I believe that the current design allows for this efficiently.\n\nI tested the code in this PR for scalability on clusters with 2 slaves (m2.xlarge nodes) to a cluster with 16 slaves of the same variety. Master was also an m2.xlarge. Data that was thrown at this PR was generated from the LinearDataGenerator class. Ranging in size from 10m points to 50m points, and dimensions d=10 to d=50 - this equates to 700mb of training data up to 18gb of training data, all models were trained to a maximum depth of 10. Total runtime on 16 machines ranged from under 5 minutes for the 10m_10 experiment to 36 minutes for the 50m_50 experiment.\n\nScalability results are shown here:\n![screen shot 2014-03-05 at 5 49 07 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1326181/2341114/92d71ce6-a4d1-11e3-8efd-82d57dc68c27.png)\n\nOn the x-axis we have number of machines (2..16) and the y-axis is speedup. Each box in the grid represents a different dataset. Ideal scaling would be 8x. \n\nThere are several things worth pointing out on this chart:\n1. There are some cases where the 2-machine experiments didn't finish (the last 2 30m experiments and all of the 40m and 50m experiments), and in those cases ideal speedup is 4x. \n2. There are also a couple of cases where we appear to be doing better than ideal, but those are cases where GC overhead was substantial in the 2 machine case, so I don't consider those apples-to-apples.\n3. Overall, through this strategy of parallelization, we see an average of a 6.6x speedup for 16 nodes vs. 2 (17% deterioration from ideal) with a standard deviation in speedup of 0.7 across these experiments for those observations that I'm calling \"fair\".

If we shade like this for the `package` target of core, then as far as I understand this will embed a shaded version of `asm` inside of our spark packaged jars, similar to what parquet does with thrift [1] and it will rename all references to asm inside of Spark to use that new name.\n\nHowever, in Spark's case the reason we bumped asm to 4.0 is because a Spark dependency, Kryo, depends on asm 4.0. So if someone is, say building an application against spark that they run locally they will still pull in the kryo dependency and transitively asm 4.0 and they still have the problem. Right?\n\nI think probably what we want here is to do the shading inside of the assembly pom.xml so that at least for assembly Spark builds with Maven it will work correctly. \n\nUnfortunately I think the only way to have it work correctly in the transitive sense would be to build our own version of Kryo which depends on a shaded asm and then depend on that. Ala what we did with akka/protobuf.\n\nIs there a better way?\n\n[1] see contents: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.twitter/parquet-format/2.0.0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36827214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/36827278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/90#issuecomment-36827278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/90","id":36827278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODI3Mjc4","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-06T05:51:25Z","updated_at":"2014-03-06T05:51:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sryza or maybe if we shade _both_ kryo and asm in the package jar, the shader plug-in is good enough to figure out that one is a dependency of the other and embed both asm and kryo-with-shaded-asm.
