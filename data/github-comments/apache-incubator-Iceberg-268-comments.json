with @szehon-ho offline. Looks like this patch aimed to filter manifest entries will cause some problem when both column projection on `.partitions` column only and partition filter are used together when query metadata tables. It will throw nullPointerException when recordCount was missing when using MetricsEvaluator.\r\n\r\nBehind the scene, when we trying to push down partition filter on [ManifestReader](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/ManifestReader.java#L301), it filter partition as rows and thus require column stats to evaluate but at minimal the record count is required in such metrics evaluator. We tried to go through a few options such as add virtual column (`record_count`) on projection and removed later when returned, similar to how ReadableMetrics was handled in #7364. But this adds a lot complexity in the code without noticeable gain, as in-memory filtering of manifestEntry in iceberg is not siginpificantly faster as filtering in

filter pushdown on deletes since (from my first pass reading of the code) it might throw an exception.\r\n\r\nI mentioned a little in the descriptions.\r\n```\r\nThis is the first part code. It changes filters to V2 filters and adds support to convert system functions wrapped in Spark UserDefinedScalarFunc to Iceberg expressions. In the following PR will add a rule to convert the system function call to\r\nApplyFunctionExpression which could be pushed down to the data source.\r\n```\r\nActually, I have submitted some of the code for the rule and SQL UTs. However, they are split out to keep the PR small for review.
