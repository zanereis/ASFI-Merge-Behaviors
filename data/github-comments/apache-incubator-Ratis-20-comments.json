This PR add a if-clause to create directory only when the directory does not exists.\r\n\r\nThe actual cause is, one large snapshot file may require **multiple installSnapshot RPCs** to transfer. The first RPC will create `tmpSnapshotFile`, and the subsequent RPCs will append chunk data to this existed `tmpSnapshotFile`.  These subsequent RPCs will fail when calling `createDirectories` as the `tmpSnapshotFile` already exists.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think we shall call `createDirectories` once when `tmpSnapshotFile` does not exist.

It's also a feature very wanted by Apache IoTDB. \r\nA small question. Current transferLeadership implementation will abort if it doesn't succeed for a random election timeout. Can we add a param to let the caller decide the excepted timeout for transferLeadership? We can control the stop-write duration through this param, whether to wait definitely or indefinitely, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1385418816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1385430203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/807#issuecomment-1385430203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/807","id":1385430203,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5Sk_y7","user":{"login":"kaijchen","id":5821159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjExNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5821159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-17T13:32:40Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T13:32:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> A small question.

The old priority based TransferLeadership allows a user specified timeout.\r\nI will preserve this behavior. If the timeout is not set, it will default to a random election timeout. Otherwise, the user specified timeout will be used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1385430203/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1385562211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/807#issuecomment-1385562211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/807","id":1385562211,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5SlgBj","user":{"login":"kaijchen","id":5821159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjExNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5821159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-17T15:01:59Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T15:01:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the current change is a good first step. @szetszwo @SzyWilliam PTAL, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1385562211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1386434153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/808#issuecomment-1386434153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/808","id":1386434153,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5So05p","user":{"login":"kaijchen","id":5821159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjExNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5821159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-18T03:31:10Z","updated_at":"2023-01-18T03:31:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Sadly this will break backward compatibility.
