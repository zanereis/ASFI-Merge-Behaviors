it took me a bit to get to this:\r\n\r\n> This feature (Kerberos for gremlin-python) turned out to have a pretty large footprint because of the need to make the KDC server available in both gremlin-test and the gremlin-server-test docker container. \r\n\r\nyep - that spun out of control quickly :)\r\n\r\n> I am not entirely sure whether the gremlin-test jar-with-dependencies is the cleanest way to make the KDC available in the Docker container.\r\n\r\nThat struck me as well in review. My initial reaction was that I'd like to keep `gremlin-test` isolated to Gremlin provider testing and to move re-usable test components somewhere else. I think we have other odds and ends like this KDC fixture. I'll need to think about that a bit more.\r\n\r\n> Because of the sheer complexity of Kerberos configs and error messages I thought it useful to document the transcripts of the manual connections made against the gremlin-server-test docker container. If reviewers feel the same, please state what is the best location for it (possibly not the current location docker/gremlin-server/docker-entrypoint.sh).\r\n\r\nI liked that bit of documentation actually. I was content with where you put it for now, but I will think so more on it.\r\n\r\n> Does anyone with knowledge of gremlin-dotnet see what is the matter? All earlier travis builds (red crosses above) only failed on gremlin-python, so if gremlin-dotnet builds are consistent, the current failure suggests the addition of the gcc and python3.6-dev packages would somehow interfere with dotnet.\r\n> If no ideas pop up, I will revert and reapply the gcc and python3.6-dev changes later this week and see what happens.\r\n> What is there to do to stop travis whining?\r\n\r\nTravis is flakey and I don't think it's our tests that cause the trouble. The environment fails for all sorts of reasons (e.g. internet connections die, VMs randomly timeout for no reason, etc). I've yet to see a pattern of failure that involves anything we can fix on our end unfortunately. I pretty much just look for clear test failures in Travis as things to worry about and just re-run tests as needed that failed to get a green run. I also mostly rely on my own local build. If i get a clean build with `mvn` and a good docker build locally it should be pretty solid.\r\n\r\nTravis seems happier now so whatever was the matter seems resolved. There was a failure with spark as of your last commit but I assume that's nothing. I restarted it and seems happy now\r\n\r\nI'll start thinking about the items I mentioned above to see what changes I might suggest.

Assume authentication is enabled with `WsAndHttpChannelizerHandler` and and `SaslAndHttpBasicAuthenticationHandler`，and keep http connection alive.\r\n2. Login user1 with username1+password1(in http basic auth), and gremlin-server can get user information from http header \"Authorization\"(through `HttpBasicAuthenticationHandler`).\r\n3. Login user2 with username2+password2 in the same way, the user information cannot be obtained, and this problem occurs when we keep using the same TCP connection.\r\n\r\nDetailed analysis:\r\n\r\n1. Login user1, the pipeline status is: http-response-encoder -> WebSocketServerProtocolHandshakeHandler -> ... -> request-close-decoder  -> authenticator\r\n2.

Until now this is correct.\r\n5. Login user2, if the TCP connection is the same, netty will use the original channel, so the original pipline is also be used, the pipeline status is: http-response-encoder -> authenticator -> **http-authentication** -> request-handler.\r\n6.

We are on the same page here. While writing my explanation, I missed that step#7 is not adding the http-authenticator back. Your change will definitely fix this issue. \r\n\r\nBefore we push this change, can you please add a couple of more associated changes that will ensure we catch such bugs proactively in future.\r\n1. Add logic to validate that the pipeline has been setup as expected. You might want to leverage the [finalize method in AbstractChannelizer](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/cc3c5cb83e253b9949076628a7cfaade7f86f40e/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/AbstractChannelizer.java#L124). Note that this wouldn't catch pipeline setup issues where it is modified dynamically based on message information while processing the message. For that, we will do #2\r\n2. Add tests to validate the pipeline through which a message is executed. If we had this test, this bug would have been caught earlier. \r\n\r\nAfter you have made the above changes, we can push this change out while separately working on the larger issue as described below.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I called this change as a workaround is because, while it solves this particular problem of missing http-authenticator, it doesn't address the underlying issue which is dynamic modification of pipeline when more than one request is expected. \r\n\r\nEach request is expected to be processed by a deterministic set of handlers. In some cases such as WS and HTTP being served on same connection, this handler chain is created dynamically based on the request headers or content. However, when we execute two requests on the same pipeline (case of keepAlive), both the requests would try to modify the same pipeline at the same time which might lead to a case when the pipeline is misconfigured. e.g. while one message [has removed the PIPELINE_AUTHENTICATOR handler](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/cc3c5cb83e253b9949076628a7cfaade7f86f40e/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/handler/WsAndHttpChannelizerHandler.java#L68) (and has not added it back yet in the next line), in a separate thread, another message would reach a [check for PIPELINE_AUTHENTICATOR presence in the same pipeline](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/cc3c5cb83e253b9949076628a7cfaade7f86f40e/gremlin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/handler/WsAndHttpChannelizerHandler.java#L65) and finds that it isn't present, hence, not taking the actions to configure the pipeline correctly.\r\n\r\nDo you agree that this is still a problem even after the fix you proposed and can lead to a similar misconfigured pipeline?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/636244153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/636298634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1285#issuecomment-636298634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1285","id":636298634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjI5ODYzNA==","user":{"login":"vtslab","id":6702316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDIzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6702316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab","html_url":"https://github.com/vtslab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-30T08:26:40Z","updated_at":"2020-05-30T08:26:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good point to also update the dev docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/636298634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/636308564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1290#issuecomment-636308564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1290","id":636308564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjMwODU2NA==","user":{"login":"vtslab","id":6702316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDIzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6702316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab","html_url":"https://github.com/vtslab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-30T10:03:13Z","updated_at":"2020-05-30T10:03:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with this comment on the original PR:\r\n\"I do think the hardcoded \"3.5.0-SNAPSHOT\" in docker-entrypoint.sh needs to be dynamically referenced.\"\r\nFrom the docker/gremlin-server/Dockerfile.template a GREMLIN_SERVER_VERSION variable is available from the environment.

am not sure I agree that \"most\" Python Gremlin apps are single threaded. Just because Python has the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) does not mean that the threading library is not effective in I/O bound scenarios. I regularly write Python Gremlin apps that have anywhere from 8 to 96 threads. Because requests to a Gremlin Server tend to be I/O bound the Python threading library actually works well as threads will naturally block while waiting for I/O. Rather than change these defaults I think a better solution might actually be to add as needed to the documentation giving specific examples of where different configurations make sense and include code examples of how to set those configurations up. I am aware of many good use cases for each. Here are just two cases\r\n\r\n1. A client doing a lot of writes across multiple threads from a container/API server etc. (multiple threads definitely help here).\r\n\r\n2. An AWS Lambda function where it makes sense to have just 1 connection as you can think of a Lambda as being a thread in that context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/644132867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/645536476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1290#issuecomment-645536476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1290","id":645536476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTUzNjQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T18:11:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T18:11:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vtslab sorry this one is still not merged - i'd like to get #1299 in first then look to merging this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/645536476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/645979055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1299#issuecomment-645979055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1299","id":645979055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTk3OTA1NQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T12:13:42Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T12:13:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Are we dropping support for jdk 8 altogether?\r\n\r\nI think we are dropping support for buliding on jdk8, at least insofar as our maven configuration. You need jdk11 to build going forward. However, we support running on jdk8. \r\n\r\nI'm glad you brought this up because I still had an old configuration in there from some early testing I was doing that had the release version at 11. It needed to be set at 8. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1299/commits/23fe7dea89f5d65f6e11b828e5fa5d4d62a68767\r\n\r\nThe cross-compilation option is described here:\r\n\r\nhttp://openjdk.java.net/jeps/247\r\n\r\n> I think we should add a job below using openjdk8, that way we know that we are not breaking java 8 support.\r\n\r\nMy understanding here is that this setting would catch those situations where we used something incompatible with jdk8 at compile time. In this way we would not need to explicitly build on jdk8. I suppose there could be some argument to somehow test the jdk11 built artifacts on jdk8 but I guess that would take some extra work here.\r\n\r\nThe guidance on this stuff has been scattered and unclear in some ways. What I've outline here has been gathered from a wide variety of blog posts, stackoverflow comments, etc. If I'm misunderstanding something, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/645979055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/648741616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1298#issuecomment-648741616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1298","id":648741616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODc0MTYxNg==","user":{"login":"humbleengineer","id":39339400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzM5NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39339400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer","html_url":"https://github.com/humbleengineer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humbleengineer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T10:37:39Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T10:37:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback, @krlawrence.

In that way getting a \"mapper\" becomes generalized to the `MessageSerializer` interface. The `MessageSerializer` would have:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMapper getMapper();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then you could just construct your own from that:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMapper<ObjectMapper> mapperObjectMapper = graphsonMessagerSerializer.getMapper();\r\nObjectMapper objectMapper = mapperObjectMapper.createMapper()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI imagine there are some generics to sort out in all this and I'm not sure if it can be done without breaking changes (so perhaps only a suitable change to 3.5.0). It would also require GraphBinary to have a `Mapper` implementation. There could be other problems too. \r\n\r\nI just thought I'd mention this approach as it is a bit more robust than just adding getters for specific class types.

No. There weren't any server tests to test this scenario. The way how those tests are set up do not allow things like closing a connection. That is why I added the concept of `SimpleWebSocketServer` and associated tests. With these we can configure the behaviour of the server wrt Netty connection as needed for client testing.\r\n7. Yes, I was hoping to do that on merge. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/677784939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/678554629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1309#issuecomment-678554629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1309","id":678554629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODU1NDYyOQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T23:24:19Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T23:24:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/678554629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/678859337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1313#issuecomment-678859337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1313","id":678859337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODg1OTMzNw==","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T01:31:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T01:31:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"VOTE +1 LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/678859337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/679300195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1308#issuecomment-679300195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1308","id":679300195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTMwMDE5NQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T18:45:26Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T18:45:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i'm finally getting to this - sorry for the delay. the general direction here seems ok. i like that it doesn't particularly impose anything on providers who implement Gremlin Server protocol - it just introduces a companion to authentication interfaces. \r\n\r\nI think `Authorizer` would be better as an interface with just the:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic AuthorizedUser authorize(final AuthenticatedUser user, final RequestMessage msg) throws AuthorizationException\r\n```\r\n\r\nand some kind of `AbstractAuthorizer` that has your \"preprocessing\" as a base for folks to implement from. \r\n\r\nI might have more to say about `AuthorizationHandler`, `AuthorizedUser` and the default `Authorization` implementation but for the most part it seems simple and straightforward enough.
