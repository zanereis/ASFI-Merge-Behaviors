because I'd like to help you avoid running into painful whitespace related merge issues due to #688 which I'm currently working on and would like to wrap up today, here's what I'm going to do about this PR:\r\n\r\nI'll local pull this, and make the changes which @Sanyam96 suggests, and merge it ASAP. (This will allow me to then rebase #688 and do the overall whitespace clean up, which will unblock #689 which I'd like to get in rather sooner than later.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/576003452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/576004399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/694#issuecomment-576004399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/694","id":576004399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjAwNDM5OQ==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-19T13:25:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T13:25:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This build will most likely fail, because it's Sunday, due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-820 (what a PITA, is anyone ever going to fix that?).

I got no response and saw that Nazeer assigned to himself some days after that and guessed that he would fix this issue. As you can see on Jiira comments I just did this pull request just to show that what I pointed Iniitially was the problem and that we shouldn't gave up so easily on this issue.
