reason of this issue is that MySQL and Java are different in the ordering for strings.\r\n\r\nWhen SQL `select code from t group by code` execute, ShardingSphere will route and rewrite to following SQL\r\n```\r\nselect code from t_0 group by code order by code\r\n\r\n// result \r\n110358011282D4\r\n110358011282E9\r\n110358011282h8\r\n110358011282I0\r\n110358011282l1\r\n110358011282O7\r\n110358011282P0\r\n110358011282T4\r\n110358011282w6\r\n\r\nselect code from t_1 group by code order by code\r\n\r\n// result\r\n11035801128253\r\n110358011282f5\r\n110358011282G1\r\n110358011282H5\r\n110358011282T4\r\n110358011282U5\r\n110358011282z1\r\n```\r\nAs the result show, in MySQL, because you **set the COLLATE='utf8mb4_unicode_ci'**, so the lowercase is same as uppercase while sorting.\r\nBut in Java, all lowercase are larger than uppercase, for example, `110358011282f5` is large than `110358011282G1`.\r\nAnd in ShardingSphere, there is one PriorityQueue to get ResultSet according to the smallest value, which caused SS can't aggregate the same value.\r\n\r\nFor SQL `select max(code) from t group by upper(code)`, the order item is `upper(code)`\r\nthe order of PriorityQueue is correct, so the result is correct.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/510349673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/510367725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2672#issuecomment-510367725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2672","id":510367725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDM2NzcyNQ==","user":{"login":"liweiboy","id":37232258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjMyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37232258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy","html_url":"https://github.com/liweiboy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liweiboy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T07:36:04Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T07:36:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Because

I use Navicat to execute sql, I get a right result, but **I get a NPE** too.\r\nThis is my multiple dataSources configuration.\r\n```yml\r\ndataSources:\r\n  ds_0:\r\n    url: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/test?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false\r\n    username: sunbufu\r\n    password: 123456\r\n    connectionTimeoutMilliseconds: 30000\r\n    idleTimeoutMilliseconds: 60000\r\n    maxLifetimeMilliseconds: 1800000\r\n    maxPoolSize: 50\r\n  ds_1:\r\n    url: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/test1?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false\r\n    username: sunbufu\r\n    password: 123456\r\n    connectionTimeoutMilliseconds: 30000\r\n    idleTimeoutMilliseconds: 60000\r\n    maxLifetimeMilliseconds: 1800000\r\n    maxPoolSize: 50\r\n\r\nshardingRule:\r\n  tables:\r\n    book:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds_${0..1}.book_${0..1}\r\n      tableStrategy:\r\n        inline:\r\n          shardingColumn: book_id\r\n          algorithmExpression: book_${book_id % 2}\r\n      keyGenerator:\r\n        type: SNOWFLAKE\r\n        column: book_id\r\n  bindingTables:\r\n    - book\r\n  defaultDatabaseStrategy:\r\n    inline:\r\n      shardingColumn: book_id\r\n      algorithmExpression: ds_${book_id % 2}\r\n  defaultTableStrategy:\r\n    none:\r\n```\r\nThis is my NPE.\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] 08:47:53.220 [ShardingSphere-Command-7] o.a.s.s.f.c.CommandExecutorTask - Exception occur: \r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: null\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.datasource.JDBCBackendDataSource.createConnection(JDBCBackendDataSource.java:150)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.datasource.JDBCBackendDataSource.getConnections(JDBCBackendDataSource.java:123)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.connection.BackendConnection.getConnectionFromUnderlying(BackendConnection.java:189)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.connection.BackendConnection.getConnectionsWithoutTransaction(BackendConnection.java:172)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.connection.BackendConnection.getConnections(BackendConnection.java:141)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.execute.callback.ProxyJDBCExecutePrepareCallback.getConnections(ProxyJDBCExecutePrepareCallback.java:56)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.core.execute.sql.prepare.SQLExecutePrepareTemplate.getSQLExecuteGroups(SQLExecutePrepareTemplate.java:90)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.core.execute.sql.prepare.SQLExecutePrepareTemplate.getSynchronizedExecuteUnitGroups(SQLExecutePrepareTemplate.java:68)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.core.execute.sql.prepare.SQLExecutePrepareTemplate.getExecuteUnitGroups(SQLExecutePrepareTemplate.java:59)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.execute.JDBCExecuteEngine.execute(JDBCExecuteEngine.java:78)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.execute(JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.java:91)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.communication.jdbc.JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.execute(JDBCDatabaseCommunicationEngine.java:77)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.backend.text.query.QueryBackendHandler.execute(QueryBackendHandler.java:54)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.frontend.mysql.command.query.text.query.MySQLComQueryPacketExecutor.execute(MySQLComQueryPacketExecutor.java:72)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.frontend.command.CommandExecutorTask.executeCommand(CommandExecutorTask.java:86)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.shardingproxy.frontend.command.CommandExecutorTask.run(CommandExecutorTask.java:66)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\nI try to track it, and I find Navicat will execute some extra sql around my actual sql for performance analysis like this.\r\n```sql\r\nSET PROFILING = 1;\r\n-- my actual sql\r\nSELECT QUERY_ID, SUM(DURATION) AS SUM_DURATION FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROFILING GROUP BY QUERY_ID;\r\n```\r\n`RoutingEngineFactory.newInstance()` will return a `DefaultDatabaseRoutingEngine` when execute `SELECT QUERY_ID, SUM(DURATION) AS SUM_DURATION FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROFILING GROUP BY QUERY_ID;`, but I have not set `defaultDataSourceName` in my configuration, so I get a NPE for this.\r\nSo, I think it is complex for user who just want use sharding-proxy. We must add some check for this.\r\nWhat do you think ? Should sharding-proxy set a default value for `defaultDataSourceName`,  or tell user that `defaultDataSourceName` is required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/511165646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/511252804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2702#issuecomment-511252804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2702","id":511252804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTI1MjgwNA==","user":{"login":"zcqshine","id":3348571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine","html_url":"https://github.com/zcqshine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcqshine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T01:30:28Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T01:30:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK,

I have been thinking for a long time about the readonly parameter, and I cloud't found any scenario. \r\n1. If we use readonly for sharding, we will get many problems, such as which datasource should we use for DML or DQL, but It won't bring us any benefits.\r\n2. If we use readonly for master-slave, I think readonly is redundant, because master must be writeable and slave must be readable.\r\n3. If we use readonly for encrypt, I think it's redundant too.\r\n\r\nSo, I think maybe we don't need readonly parameter in sharding-sphere.
