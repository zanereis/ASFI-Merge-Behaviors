for you reply.\r\nfor example, before we use proxy, we open web page , it may cost 0.5 sec , and we use proxy ,same web page maybe cost 3 sec , after we see the log , find query cost most time,  so I use navicat to connect Mysql directly and use navicat to connect Mysql by proxy to compare query cost time. specifically , \r\nwe find if our sql contains left join which we sharding table , it will cost much more time to query ,cloud you give me some advice to deal with this ? \r\n\r\n### Which version of ShardingSphere did you use?\r\nApache ShardingSphere - Version: 4.1.1\r\n### Which project

The capacity of the query thread pool is too small.  when I restart proxy , it seems more quickly than which The proxy longer the running time is.\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL
