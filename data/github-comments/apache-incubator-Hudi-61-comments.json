While I agree that abstracting RDD into a WriteInput, like to understand how the existing code is going to evolve further. May I ask that we do a draft or first that replaces the entire code in hudi-client with these abstractions ( no need to even have the code compile.

Building staging docs\r\n\r\nWhen you submit a pull request for any changes on websites or docs, we recommend you generate staging site for review.\r\n\r\nYou can refer to the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. You need to create a github repo called `hudi-staging-site` under your github account. You can fork this [staging repo](https://github.com/ApacheHudi/hudi-staging-site) as well.\r\n2. In your `hudi-staging-site` repo, go to `Settings > GitHub Pages`. Enable `GitHub Pages` on `master branch`.\r\n3. Make changes to the website, follow the steps above to verify the changes locally.\r\n4. Once the changes are verified locally, you can run following command, It will generate the files under `docs/_site`.\r\n   `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.staging.yml`. \r\n5. Push the generated website to your `hudi-staging-site`.\r\n6.
