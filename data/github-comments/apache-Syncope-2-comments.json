have examined the PR content, and fixed several things (related to the build process) in the [attached commit](https://github.com/apache/syncope/files/695609/0001-Several-pom-fixes-proper-LICENSE-and-NOTICE-package-.zip): please unzip and apply it to your own branch via `git am`.\r\n\r\nOnce done that, I have actually tried the plugin with my own Netbeans.\r\n\r\nRight after plugin installation, I went to `Window > Apache Syncope` (no icon and in first place inside the menu, room to improve) and a new window appeared on the left side containing the `Apache Syncope` label with two more labels underneath (again, no icons): `Mail Template` (not 'templates'?) and `Report XSLTs` (why not 'templates'?).\r\n\r\nI could not find a place where to insert the actual Syncope deployment coordinates (base REST URL, username and password), so I went to the code and found that such info is stored inside a `UserData.txt` file - evidently supposed to be found in my home directory.\r\nIn fact, I tried to click on \"Reset Connection\" and an exception was reported by Netbeans about such missing file.\r\n\r\nSo, I created such file with the expected content and got new exception (see below).\r\n\r\nI do believe the whole server coordinates management must be properly handled, I would expect that Netbeans offers some mechanism to store a given plugin's preferences; hence URL, username and password could simply go there.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnnotation: Offending classloader:

As I understand in SAML SP logic always replaced. So even when we logged, as usual, the access token may changed by SAML SP. So I can understand the importance of what replaceExisitng flag does. After imposing the UNIQUE constraint as in my implementation replaceExisting == true works as expected(always).But sometimes even if the flag is false the token may be replaced (scenario discussed in mail thread). But this is only when the same user tries to log in at the same time & thread not safe problem aise. Anyway this approach is far better than using locks which causes performance drop and this is a rare case as well.

When editing an existing ODIC provider, make all the second step's fields as read-only, and show them all despite the Discovery Document was used during create\r\n\r\nSide note: I see there is no yet
