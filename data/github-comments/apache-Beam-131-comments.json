general approach.\r\n\r\nI see two improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Providing a simple, uniform way to name shaded artifacts by establishing a central rewritten `artifactId`. This is succeeding where #744 failed!\r\n2. Providing a centralized way to ensure that Guava is not on the public API surface of any module.\r\n\r\nI see two downsides:\r\n\r\n1. Extra executions for modules that don't depend on Guava. This will slow the build.\r\n2. Modules that need to shade more than just Guava will have to override the shading config. They may actually get it wrong after that, so Guava might still be exposed. -- Thus, while this reduces the amount of config necessary in common cases, does guarantee solution.\r\n\r\nI would probably:\r\n* move the shading config back into individual modules. build perf + accuracy. But use the new `artifactId` trick to make the config more uniform.\r\n* find a better way to actually verify that the final output artifacts don't expose Guava. (out of scope for this PR.) This is in-line with prior PR comments.\r\n\r\nIn otherwords, I would probably take improvement 1, but not 2. 1 is a clear win, but 2 has some drawbacks and doesn't quite guarantee success to justify those drawbacks

@davorbonaci\r\n\r\nThe meat of this PR is the new implementation of `ParDo.Bound.expand()` as an application of `ParDo.BoundMulti` rather than a primitive output. The remaining work deletes all special handling performed by runners on the `ParDo.Bound` transform, as it's now merely a convenience for users rather than a primitive transform.\r\n\r\nThis brings the Java SDK definition of ParDo in line with the runner API definition.\r\n\r\n@amitsela @tweise @aljoscha \r\n\r\nIt is possible that specialized translations for a `ParDo.Bound` should still exist, and instead be applied to all `ParDos` with a single output, if there is a performance-sensitive choice made between the translation of the two 'types' of ParDo.\r\n\r\n@kennknowles","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/283810873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/283811590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2145#issuecomment-283811590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2145","id":283811590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzgxMTU5MA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T23:04:23Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T23:04:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/8060/<h2>Build result: FAILURE</span></h2>[...truncated 665.85 KB...]\tat hudson.remoting.UserRequest.perform(UserRequest.java:153)\tat hudson.remoting.UserRequest.perform(UserRequest.java:50)\tat hudson.remoting.Request$2.run(Request.java:336)\tat hudson.remoting.InterceptingExecutorService$1.call(InterceptingExecutorService.java:68)\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)Caused by: org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoFailureException: You have 1 Checkstyle violation.\tat org.apache.maven.plugin.checkstyle.CheckstyleViolationCheckMojo.execute(CheckstyleViolationCheckMojo.java:588)\tat org.apache.maven.plugin.DefaultBuildPluginManager.executeMojo(DefaultBuildPluginManager.java:134)\tat org.apache.maven.lifecycle.internal.MojoExecutor.execute(MojoExecutor.java:208)\t... 31 more2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] 2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] 2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoFailureException2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] 2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command2017-03-02T23:04:16.114 [ERROR]   mvn <goals> -rf :beam-runners-google-cloud-dataflow-javachannel stoppedSetting status of 3b37e4caf7f9dff3dcc790df9fe9e2ab1cd9e8dd to FAILURE with url https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/8060/ and message: 'Build finished.
