Hi, recently i am fixing this problem, and this issue occurrs to me. ShardingSphere needs a copy of metadata info to help parsing your SQLs, and checks the metadata consistancy of all the sharding tables. But there is a switch named `check.table.metadata.enabled` to decide to check it or not. If you don't want to cost too much time when startup, you can config this property. More details, please refer to our document. Thanks.
