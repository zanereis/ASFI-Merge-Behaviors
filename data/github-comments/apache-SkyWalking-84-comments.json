How to query metadata. Service is an atomic object but based on instance register. So how do you plan to make tag exists in service level. And how do you make sure it is reasonable.\r\n1. Query topology based on each service, and merged them on UI. If the performance is acceptable. The master branch UI topology is just changed. It supports query topology(one depth level) when you choose one at the left.
