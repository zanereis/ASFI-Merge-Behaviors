I had tried implementing this awhile back allowing the user to tab into the table and then navigate from there. I wasn't thrilled with the solution as it required the user to tab twice to get focus into the first visible row. I believe the double tab was required due to the 'focusSink' that `SlickGrid` adds to the DOM [1]. This functionality is already in master. In conjunction with your PR, I like the capability much better. Now the user can navigate from the filter field and from the table if they get focus into the table via tab (albeit double tab) or clicking on a row.\r\n\r\nJust a couple minor comments on the PR. \r\n\r\n- I believe these `nfFilteredDialogCommon` needs to be included in nf-settings for the Add Reporting Task dialog.\r\n- Also, I was wondering if it would be possible for pageDown/pageUp to select the first/last visible row after navigating. The behavior seems a little inconsistent currently. If the table has/had focus from clicking on a row, then the pageDown/pageUp behavior seems right. If it hasn't, the pageDown/pageUp just navigates the view but does not change the selected row. It would be nice if the selected row changed with the view regardless if the navigation is being triggered through `nfFilteredDialogCommon` or through the existing capabilities. Let me know if you need to me to explain what I'm seeing further.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/blob/bf4705a96c40fea088216034def4d0256a335e65/slick.grid.js#L237","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/331540402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/331567367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2024#issuecomment-331567367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2024","id":331567367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTU2NzM2Nw==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T21:42:05Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T21:42:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Excuse me, but please review this if anyone could.

here are my thoughts on this PR:\r\n\r\n* I got test failures on `TestListenUDP` when running the full build. I am assuming nothing here changed that so it's unrelated and I won't count it against this PR, but making a note here because I had not seen it on `master`. \r\n* There are checkstyle issues I [noted above](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2177#issuecomment-332344883). \r\n* I validated the following use cases:\r\n  * Normal positive flow\r\n  * Bad username/password fails\r\n  * The Knox user authenticates but has no access policies on the canvas\r\n  * The Knox user JWT has no audiences and NiFi does not require any\r\n  * The Knox user JWT has no audiences and NiFi requires one\r\n  * The Knox user JWT has the wrong audience (i.e. not one required by NiFi)\r\n  * The Knox user JWT has the correct audience as required by NiFi\r\n  * The Knox user is logged in with one browser and another user is logged in via client certificate in another\r\n* Issues found:\r\n  * No way to logout of the Knox user through the NiFi UI (treated same as client certificate)\r\n    * Workaround: Use browser to delete `hadoop-jwt` cookie\r\n  * If Knox SSO is configured to provide the wrong/insufficient audiences, the login UX simply immediately redirects to the Knox login UI with no error message\r\n    * Workaround: the NiFi User Log (`logs/nifi-user.log`) contains a helpful error message\r\n\r\nTo me, neither issue is a blocker for this PR but I do think they should be resolved in a future release. +1, LGTM (with the checkstyle violation resolutions pending).

If we treated receiving the `hadoop-jwt` token from Knox the same way we did the credential check for LDAP or Kerberos, and issued our own JWT, deleting the local JWT would trigger re-validating the `hadoop-jwt` cookie. If we update the local key store to indicate that that specific JWT is no longer valid, I believe we could trigger a redirect to the Knox service. However, my understanding is that we cannot simply delete the `hadoop-jwt` cookie because other services rely on it for SSO, and I do not know what the Knox API is like to trigger a logout remotely. At this time, I do not have a good suggestion for this scenario (other than to clearly note it for administrators and users because it may be confusing).

I had observed the same behavior where the user is redirected back to the login page when the token could not be validated. I think a good path forward here may be to support multiple login mechanisms concurrently (ldap, oidc, and knox for instance). When this is the case, the NiFi login page would likely offer buttons for the user to initiate the desired SSO login sequence. The reason this is awkward currently is because the redirection happens automatically. This could also give us an opportunity to provide some sort of error message to the end user. Let's consider this option and the logout concern is separate follow on JIRAs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/332582595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/332587131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2177#issuecomment-332587131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2177","id":332587131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjU4NzEzMQ==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-27T16:57:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T16:57:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Matt.

I made it follow the pattern from the 'Columns' property in GetHBase.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about these changes.
