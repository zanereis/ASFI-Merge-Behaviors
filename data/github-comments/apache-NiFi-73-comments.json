Also rebased with the latest master just in case.\r\n\r\nI considered to implement the use of BlockingQueue for further optimization, too. However, I think it may be dangerous to reuse the same byte[] object because different FlowFiles may have different size of content. For example, the 1st FlowFile content is 'foo bar', then the 2nd FlowFile's is 'baz', then the 2nd message would be 'baz bar'. In addition to that, the `ProducerRecord` provided by Kafka client library does not take `size` and `offset` those are usually used to specify a part of a larger byte array. So, I think we need to create new byte[] object for each message. I hope my understanding is correct. But if there's more optimization can be done, please file a separate JIRA as I think it's out of scope for this ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/355443080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/355520858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2376#issuecomment-355520858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2376","id":355520858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTUyMDg1OA==","user":{"login":"kevdoran","id":5102332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIzMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5102332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran","html_url":"https://github.com/kevdoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T10:21:39Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T10:21:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI @alopresto and @bbende - This is ready to be reviewed for merge to master.\r\n\r\nThere are still a few test cases I would like to add, time permitting, for xml files, but that could be addressed in a follow up PR, along with additional refinement and a refactoring that @alopresto and I have discussed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/355520858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/355564348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2195#issuecomment-355564348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2195","id":355564348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTU2NDM0OA==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T14:15:21Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T14:15:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yup.

The PR is closed without being reviewed and I can't find other PRs created for NIFI-4745. Do you have a PR ready for being reviewed somewhere?\r\n\r\nAbout your concern to add another argument to the completeFlowFile method which has already lots of arguments, I think that should be fine, since it's just a private method and the method is a good place to add new attribute values.\r\n\r\nBTW, ValidateRecord can validate multiple Records within a single incoming FlowFile. Is it going to be sufficient to write validation result to a FlowFile attribute? Isn't it be more useful if we can write validation failure detail to the outgoing Records, so that each record can have its failure detail?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/357836855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/357838881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2213#issuecomment-357838881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2213","id":357838881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzgzODg4MQ==","user":{"login":"Senthilannaswamy","id":9284726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9284726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/Senthilannaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Senthilannaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T02:48:54Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T02:48:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mcgilman\r\nNo I've not created any Jira for this issue.
