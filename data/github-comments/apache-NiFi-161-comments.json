What do you think about something along the lines of `minimal`, `truncated`, or `summarized`?  It is a minor thing when it comes to implementation, but some more descriptive of the function, versus the implied consumer, seems like it would be helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/946284268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/946313877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5457#issuecomment-946313877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5457","id":946313877,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM44Z5qV","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-19T02:27:59Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T02:27:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Here, we do not want to guarantee any sort of backward compatibility between versions.\r\n\r\nThanks for the background @markap14, that is helpful.

It might even be better to introduce a separate REST API method to help indicate the unstable nature of this representation, but since others approve the changes as implemented, no need to make further adjustments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/949722494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/949794182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5444#issuecomment-949794182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5444","id":949794182,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM44nLWG","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T16:39:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T16:39:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any way to unit test this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/949794182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/949887021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5398#issuecomment-949887021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5398","id":949887021,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM44niAt","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-22T18:54:34Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T18:54:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe @greyp9's feedback has been addressed.

Shouldn't those be unencoded? My thinking is that the file names should be the same as if you used GetFile to get it.\r\n> \r\n> Hey @ottobackwards! Thank you for your review! URL encoding is a good point, I'll try to find something to handle them. I've tried to answer your other remarks, please see them above.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about unending the URL. For most characters it wouldn't be a problem, but what happens when you encode a \"/\" as %2F? In this case the filename would contain a \"/\" which is not valid in files and would also mean that you could construct a path in the filename. Since other processors expect a filename in that property, not a path, I think this wouldn't be backwards compatible. Having encoded characters in the filename is not nice, but at least they are valid. All in all, I'd leave filename as it is. If you agree, I can add a note to the documentation, that the filename could contain url encoded characters and I can also extend the test with a case which ensures that encoded characters in the url remain encoded in the filename too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/952019241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/952028630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5475#issuecomment-952028630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5475","id":952028630,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM44vs3W","user":{"login":"kevdoran","id":5102332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIzMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5102332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran","html_url":"https://github.com/kevdoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T15:00:03Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T15:00:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree for backwards compatibility with existing flows that use InvokeHTTP to GET a file and then save it to another destination (filesystem, remote server, C3 bucket, etc), it would be best to leave the filename value url encoded to protect those flows that are currently running but not designed to handle special characters. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/952028630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/952052544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5484#issuecomment-952052544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5484","id":952052544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM44vytA","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T15:25:37Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T15:25:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fix @omkadmi ! +1 Will merge.

Consider the AttributesToJSON processor ... it can render all flowfile attributes into a JSON format and output the result into ... yet another attribute!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/953305404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/953313273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5488#issuecomment-953313273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5488","id":953313273,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM440mf5","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-27T21:08:31Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T21:08:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the fix!
