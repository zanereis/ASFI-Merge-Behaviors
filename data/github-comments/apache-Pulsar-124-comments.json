But then, it invokes the method ProducerImpl::failPendingMessages(...) for dealing the message failure stuff. Definitely, it works, but not only on the message it already checked as we hoped, but just all the messages inside ProducerImpl::pendingMessagesQueue_.\r\n\r\nThe reason for erroring out all the messages in the queue after the 1st message times out is to give chance to the application to preserve ordering. \r\n\r\nIf you're publishing m1, m2 and m3. If m2 times out, a consumer might see m1 followed by m3. By clearing the queue, application can decides to resend m2 & m3 in same order (or just failed both upstream operations). \r\n\r\nAnother consideration, is that typically the timeout is set to a value which is order of magnitudes bigger than the normal publish latency (eg: 30sec vs 5millis). This means that when one message times out, it will be very likely that some bigger issue is involved and that most of the messages will anyway hit the timeout threshold.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/507815638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/507888656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4621#issuecomment-507888656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4621","id":507888656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzg4ODY1Ng==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T00:09:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T00:09:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run java8 tests\r\nrun Integration Tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/507888656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/507897493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4623#issuecomment-507897493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4623","id":507897493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzg5NzQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T01:00:22Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T01:00:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I just double checked on version 2.2.1 and the pulsar-admin client correctly uses 80 and 443 for http and https ports.\r\n\r\nOK.
