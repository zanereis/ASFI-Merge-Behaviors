At the very least, I'd add some documentation on usage.\r\n\r\nYou can of course just uncomment the `run_tests` section if you dont want it to run before each commit. I personally like it. The whole pipeline lasts like 3 min. I can understand you if you say you want to have a commit quickly done. But for me its the feeling that I am almost certain that the code I commit passes Travis and I dont need to check it every time.\r\nI have two docker containers one for python 3 and one for python 2 that I use to run tests, but if you like I can add some lines to run the tests in the python venv as well or instead.\r\n\r\n> In my experience, pre-commit hooks with long running processes is something that annoys people, rather than helping, so I don't think many people would use it in the this way. But feel free to clarify if your experience is different :)\r\n\r\nWhen I implement a new feature at first I edit the pre-commit hook change it once to the name of the new test class I am going to create along with the feature class. I am doing a kinda test-driven approach splitting the screen into one half containing the test class and one containing the feature. I can focus completly on writing logic for the feature and its tests instead of having to think about whether it works for python 2 or 3 or having some kinda linting issues I forget to check, etc. - I am done when the commit comes through. I can checkout to a commit that has a working progress of a feature. It does not need to be finished but it works until this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**\r\nI think you can use this script even if you don't use it as git pre-commit. In PyCharm I have a Run Config running this script - I only need to click a button. But in case I forget to click it right before I commit changes there might be an issue in Travis that could probably have been avoided when I had used it as git pre-commit hook.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/481443743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/481456266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5071#issuecomment-481456266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5071","id":481456266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ1NjI2Ng==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T22:00:29Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T22:00:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5071?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5071](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5071?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/ec7c67ff95e012d5609a56d358fc6c29d01d9ff6?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5071/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5071?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #5071   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   77.01%   77.01%           \n=======================================\n  Files         463      463           \n  Lines       29753    29753           \n=======================================\n  Hits        22914    22914           \n  Misses       6839     6839\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5071?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/5071?src=pr&el=footer).

@newtonle curious to know why you'd need to nest this context manager?\r\n\r\nWe've built some constructs that can build DAGs, often using the DAG context manager. The problem is that user can use these constructs within their own DAG definition files, often inside another context manager. The problem with having only the last context manager saved is that entering a second one will lose history of the first.
