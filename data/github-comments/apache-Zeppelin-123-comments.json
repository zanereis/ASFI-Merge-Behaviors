So RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java ignores return code 1 (signaled from interpreter.sh as exit code that interpreter hasn't started). Will need somebody's help to add this logic too.\r\n\r\nAnother possible improvement is that RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess could also catch root cause from logger, as you can see it does show up in the log: \r\n\r\n> DEBUG [2017-01-20 15:31:06,685] ({Exec Stream Pumper} RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java[processLine]:189) - Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkException: Keytab

I didn't know about ClassLoaderInterpreter\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our tests don't use InterpreterFactory and will use unwrapped Interpreter instance. So It won't fix flaky test.\r\n\r\nBesides, code inside interpreter itself will use incorrect classloader. Currently it isn't an issue but someday...\r\n\r\nMaybe It's better to wrap IMain or create \"scala utils\" to share common code between several scala-speaking interpreters?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/274443279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/274450661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1833#issuecomment-274450661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1833","id":274450661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQ1MDY2MQ==","user":{"login":"soralee","id":8110458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8110458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee","html_url":"https://github.com/soralee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T10:26:20Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T10:26:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested and it works very well!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/274450661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/274451256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1833#issuecomment-274451256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1833","id":274451256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQ1MTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T10:28:54Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T10:28:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Tested.
