I will incorporate your feedback and attach the patch.\n\n> When security is enabled, encryption should also be turned on by default. Otherwise we will transmit plain-text passwords over the wire.\n\nYes it makes sense. I will make a conditional check and throw an error if encryption is not enabled when security is enabled?\n\n> Should there be too modes for network transmission, 1) with cookie, one without? Do we need 32 bits for the cookie length? We should be precise about the maximum length. I saw it is set to 1024 in other places.\n\nThe buffer length will be allocated based on the cookie length that is passed in the message. I will remove the buffer size validation that we are doing now.\n\n> Should we really always send the cookie for every message? The security document mentions in T2-3 that we only want to authorize upon the first connection.\n\nYes, we took the approach to pass secure cookie for every message to keep minimal changes to the current design\n\n> Why do we transmit the cookie to the client? This seems like a major security concern. The client should always provide the cookie.\n>     edit: I see this has been specified in the document in T2-4. Still, I wonder if it would make sense to simply add this now because the workaround to fetch the cookie from the JobManager doesn't look appealing.\n\nGood catch. I forgot to revert the code after the merge and it is not required. Will fix it. \n\n> You added a Yarn specific cookie option which should be part of the general options instead.\n\nIt is added since secure cookie can be supplied when using both Yarn session CLI as well as Flink CLI. I have provided detailed explanation in one of the comments.\n\n> You've introduce a new config file to persist the app state. We already have the Yarn properties file for that.\n\nI have provided explanation on why we need new config file in one of the comments.

Having a custom exception for missing arguments to a user program is a good approach. However, it requires the author of the program to use the custom exception. At least, we would have to adapt all the included examples. Additionally, it would be nice to throw another custom exception when no Flink job was generated during execution of the jar (which might be because of missing arguments). Currently, we simply throw a `ProgramInvocationException` which could look like a serious error to the user when merely arguments are missing. \n\nSo +1 but we might do some follow-ups to fully solve the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255051701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255058600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2636#issuecomment-255058600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2636","id":255058600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTA1ODYwMA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T09:40:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T09:40:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"should be fixed now\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255058600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255070424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2570#issuecomment-255070424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2570","id":255070424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTA3MDQyNA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T10:34:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T10:34:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your comments @StefanRRichter and @kl0u.

In addition, N filters should be stored as well for comparison.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/255347269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
