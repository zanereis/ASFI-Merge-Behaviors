\r\nHi, I am sorry that I have no experience in using `ShardingSphere Agent`. As far as I know, `skywalking` automatic probe, `OpenTracing` protocol and `OpenTelemetry` protocol are three unrelated APM implementations, and before `5.0.0-beta`There is no issue that cannot use the APM function.\r\nBecause the documentation of the `master` branch is different from the documentation of the `5.0.0` branch, if you are a Chinese developer, I think you can go to https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/5.0.0/cn/features/governance/observability/ Go find the answer.\r\nMention issues unrelated to the subject under unrelated issues, I think it is inconvenient for later searchers to retrieve. I think you can create an issue with `question` with `type`, attach the steps to reproduce the issue, and use The `markdown` syntax covers code blocks. I believe friends in the community who are familiar with `shardingsphere agent` will help you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/968543673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/968552517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13606#issuecomment-968552517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13606","id":968552517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M45uvBF","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T05:29:23Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T05:29:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"**For
