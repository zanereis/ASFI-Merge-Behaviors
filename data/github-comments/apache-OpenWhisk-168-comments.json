This is an area where the semantics and implementation could be improved.\r\n> \r\n> The design partly stems from the at most once activation model, and only recording the activation metadata once after completion. The active ack is the fast pass and is sent ahead of log collection. The activation metadata waits for the logs to be drained (which can delay the write back noticeably).\r\n\r\nThanks for the answer, I figured this was probably the case. Our use case for openwhisk is entirely non-blocking activations so we rely on getting the result from the activation store. Well we hit the quark controller http endpoint for the activation with the activationId which gets it from couchdb (assuming it's not cached). When you say request/response, do you mean it's results are guaranteed externally observable for blocking activations? In the event that the activation record is lost and all of the controllers are restarted, there's never a way to get information on that activation again right?\r\n\r\nAlso yes, I did see the elasticsearch pull request for activations. We are actually interested in moving activations off couchdb, but not necessarily to elasticsearch. It's great to know that swapping out activation stores is now going to be supported though. What is your opinion on us implementing an object store (i.e. s3) `ActivationStore` for activations? The other db we would be considering moving activations to is mongo.

I'm fine with either a markdown table or an image.  \r\n\r\nI agree with you that a markdown table will probably be easier to maintain.  You might be able to seed that markdown table by grabbing the rows for the \"active\" projects from the modules.md file, copying them into the main readme, and adjusting.   I was initially hoping to be able to generate this new table using the same machinery we are using to generate modules.md, but since markdown doesn't support including files its probably not worth the effort.  Module structure doesn't change that rapidly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/611265529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/611522563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4556#issuecomment-611522563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4556","id":611522563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTUyMjU2Mw==","user":{"login":"zhuangh7","id":16149477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16149477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuangh7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangh7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-09T13:17:25Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T13:17:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > Have not tried the flow with current `ignite` version so may be it does not work with current impl and need to be adapted. `--no-trunc` was used to get full `ps` output.

The external Prometheus as a service does not expose any scraping time relabel configuration so we have added this feature to avoid such conflict.
