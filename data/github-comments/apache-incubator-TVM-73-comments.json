Please share your thoughts with the community.\r\n\r\nI think the key is ecosystem. For building more mature and larger ecosystem, the key is to attract more developers into our community. Without them, we can not be successful. No doubt is that TVM is become better and more powerful, however, to attract more developers, it is not enough. We should do more PRs to let more developers know us and be more friendly to new developers. \r\n\r\nTVM is powerful, but many people complain the code is difficult to read and even don't know how to integrate TVM into their projects. I think both of them are pointing to the same reason: we lack of enough and good documentation. As one project is developed rapidly, I fully understand we have fast pace, but we also should care new users / developers. How to make them follow our way and thoughts and contribute their power? no doubt, it is documentation, step by step documentation. Compared with LLVM, we must admit that LLVM's documentation is so nice and abundant.

For example, 1. why Auto Tunning is always 0.00 GFLPS.  / ValueError: Direct host side access to device memory is detected... / can not open shared object... and so on. This will be very useful for practice usage of TVM. Many users want to try TVM, but when they see this kind of error, they will probably give up because they don't know how to solve these strange error messages at the first glance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455858176/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455882013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2466#issuecomment-455882013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2466","id":455882013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTg4MjAxMw==","user":{"login":"Ravenwater","id":466641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjY0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/466641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater","html_url":"https://github.com/Ravenwater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ravenwater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-20T16:45:19Z","updated_at":"2019-01-20T16:45:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"IMHO, excellent documentation is essential for the knowledge transfer demanded for an Apache top level project. Documentation that is 'use case oriented' in my mind is the most productive. With general technology stacks like TVM, it is difficult to 'capture' the intent of the source code when you are coming to it from a very specific use case such as having to integrate inference in an Android app. Personally, I am most interested in custom hardware accelerators for AI workloads, and thus all the know-how in scheduling optimization for ARM and GPUs is totally uninteresting, but I am likely in a minority.\r\n\r\nI am still missing a solid software architecture articulation in any of the TVM documentation, which makes it very difficult to marry any of TVM in other application software. If that software architecture discussion would be organized again in terms of the use cases, then the reader would be able to focus on their particular problem instead of having to try to filter out all the extraneous information that has no bearing on their particular task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455882013/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455888190","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2355#issuecomment-455888190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2355","id":455888190,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTg4ODE5MA==","user":{"login":"headupinclouds","id":554720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDcyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/554720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/headupinclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headupinclouds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-20T18:02:32Z","updated_at":"2019-01-20T18:33:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I made a smaller test project [tvm_intro_topi](https://github.com/headupinclouds/tvm_intro_topi/blob/69a709e48ddb53ad7856c4c18bb99ea9f20d58c5/intro_topi.py#L101-L104) containing just the conv2d + relu chain along with a C++ test executable.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = tvm.placeholder((1, 3, 224, 224))\r\nkernel = tvm.placeholder((10, 3, 5, 5))\r\n\r\nwith tvm.target.create(\"cuda\"):\r\n    conv = topi.nn.conv2d(data, kernel, strides=1, padding=2, dilation=1)\r\n    out = topi.nn.relu(conv)\r\n    sconv = topi.generic.nn.schedule_conv2d_nchw(out)\r\n    print(tvm.lower(sconv, [data, kernel], simple_mode=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is based on the original TVM TOPI tutorial [intro_topi.py](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/45456b1495048883fa3b3f2095c6747b8188db85/tutorials/topi/intro_topi.py#L116-L123) we discussed above.\r\n\r\nBoth the C++ and Vulkan versions run correctly on the same Android test device.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: I'm seeing minor floating point differences between the two examples, but they are a very close.]\r\n\r\n> we would manually schedule the fused convolution (as minimally as possible)\r\n\r\nWhat modifications do you recommend to the `topi_intro.py` script to achieve this?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455888190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455890346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2466#issuecomment-455890346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2466","id":455890346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTg5MDM0Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-20T18:29:08Z","updated_at":"2019-01-20T18:46:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I totally agree that documentation is key to our future's success.

me express some thoughts about documentation suggestions from my mind, with the hope that my crude remarks may draw forth by abler people.\r\n\r\n> What do you think are the important categories of docs?\r\n> * In particular, how can be better (re)organize our docs hierarchy\r\n\r\nI think `Use TVM` should be first and important, not TVM internal development. i.e. Teach users how to integrate TVM into their projects smoothly and quickly should be the first place. \r\n\r\nIn this part, we should write the tutorial very detail, from `Installation` to `deployment` end to end. If have code, we should explain it line by line patiently and list the output (current execution status).  So, our `installation` ,`Compile Deep learning models`, `Auto Tuning`, `Deployment` part should be integrated into `Use TVM` and make one good example. \r\n\r\nMoreover, we should supply FAQ / Notes of some common error messages. For example, ValueError: Direct host side access to device memory is detected... / can not open shared object...  and tell users possible reasons and solutions. \r\n\r\n> Would it be helpful to introduce a global architecture diagram? what should that looks like\r\n\r\nYes. it is very helpful.  I think this diagram is good enough.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7287321/51450990-080a1f80-1d6e-11e9-8b1a-bb3f1c03be33.png)\r\n\r\n> Propose titles of docs that you would like to say, and a small abstract\r\n> * This gives us a sense of what specifically the docs we need\r\n\r\n`TVM Design and Overview`, For users want to know TVM architecture.\r\n`Use TVM`, for users who want to integrate with TVM into their projects.\r\n`Develop TVM`, for developers who want to hack TVM.\r\n `API`, For developers who look up TVM API.\r\n`Resources`  TVM educational courses, join the discussion with other TVM developers.\r\n\r\n> How do they fit into the docs hierarchy?\r\n\r\nIn `TVM Design and Overview`, we could have the architecture diagram said before and Relay / NNVM IR reference and so on.\r\n\r\nIn `Use TVM`, we could integrate with our  `installation` ,`Compile Deep learning models`, `Auto Tuning`, `Deployment` and like so on. More importantly, we should construct one good end-to-end example to show.\r\n\r\nIn `Develop TVM`, we could integrate with our `Optimize Tensor Operators` `Tensor Expression and Schedules` and like so on.\r\n\r\nIn `API`, we could integrate with our `Python API` `NNVM Core Tensor Operators` and like so on.\r\n\r\nIn `Resources`, we could list useful tutorials (including external), courses and our discussion forums.\r\n\r\n>  How can we cross-reference docs, should there be a global index into the docs?\r\n\r\nCurrent [index](https://docs.tvm.ai/genindex.html) is good enough.\r\n\r\n> When we are doing a particular doc, how can we give the reader a big picture on which part of the system we are talking about?\r\n\r\nGood title should have a help. However, we should list the information on the header of doc, includes the technical area (like frontend, topi and so on), hardware (ARM CPU, GPU, FPGA and so on).

The point is, once everything default to hidden, all needed exports must now be explicitly specified as visibility \"default\". Where the specifiers were previously missing it was OK, but not any more. I end up having to modify 18 files but most are trivial.\r\n    A few things worth noting:\r\n        in include/tvm/ir_operator.h I removed two definitions which were duplicated in the file\r\n        in nnvm/include/nnvm/node.h I moved some inline functions into places where they are declared, instead of keep the declarations and definitions separate. This is needed to resolve some compiler warnings.\r\n        Same for nnvm/include/nnvm.op.h Any inline function should be directly defined at the places of declaration. This resolved compiler warnings and is a good coding style.\r\n\r\n    Please review again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455961481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/456002407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2253#issuecomment-456002407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2253","id":456002407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjAwMjQwNw==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T09:21:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T18:15:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just curious, have you guys decided to do opt based on anf or cps?
