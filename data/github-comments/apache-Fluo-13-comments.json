Running Fluo requires Hadoop, Accumulo, and Zookeeper be running and setting these up takes a lot of time.  We wrote [Uno](https://github.com/astralway/uno) to automate setting these up for local development.  Uno can be used to test these script changes.   The instructions below show how to use Uno to test the script changes.  \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/astralway/uno.git\r\ncd uno/\r\n# Uncomment export FLUO_REPO and set it to your fluo source directory.  This \r\n# will cause uno fetch to build a snapshot version of fluo.  This soruce dir should \r\n# have your modifications to fluo script.\r\nvim conf/uno.conf\r\n# This will build Fluo and download Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Accumulo\r\n./bin/uno fetch fluo\r\n# This will configure Fluo, Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Accumulo and start them\r\n./bin/uno setup fluo\r\n# This will add Fluo, Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Accumulo to path in current shell\r\n eval \"$(./bin/uno env)\"\r\ncp install/fluo-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/fluo-app.properties ./my-app.properties\r\n# Uncomment fluo.observer.init.dir and set it to dir containing \r\n# fluo-tour-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.  Instructions later in this comment about\r\n# how to get this jar.\r\nvim my-app.properties\r\nfluo init -a myapp -p ./my-app.properties\r\n# run oracle process in background needed to exec transactions\r\nfluo oracle -a myapp > oracle.log &\r\n# This will download app jar from HDFS to tmp dir and execute it\r\nfluo exec myapp ft.Increment id000\r\n# Edit fluo script if not working as expected.  Changes will need to be copied\r\n# back to fluo source dir once you get it working as expected.\r\nvim install/fluo-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/fluo\r\nfluo exec myapp ft.Increment id000\r\nfluo exec myapp ft.Increment id002\r\nfluo scan -a myapp\r\n# Should see oracle running as first background job\r\njobs\r\n# Kill oracle if its first background job\r\nkill %1\r\n# Kill Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Accumulo\r\n./bin/uno kill\r\n```\r\nMake sure to take a look at the Uno requirements section.  Uno requires password less ssh and JAVA_HOME to be set.  Make sure that `ssh localhost env | grep JAVA_HOME` works and does not ask for a password.\r\n\r\nThe instructions above require a simple Fluo app for the exec command to execute.   I created [fluo-tour.zip](https://github.com/apache/fluo/files/1422443/fluo-tour.zip) containing a simple app and attached it.  To build this yourself, take the following java code.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage ft;\r\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\r\n\r\npublic class Increment {\r\n  \r\n  @Inject\r\n  private static FluoConfiguration fluoConfig;\r\n  \r\n  private static Column SUM_COL = new Column(\"stat\",\"sum\");\r\n  \r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    try(FluoClient client = FluoFactory.newClient(fluoConfig)) {\r\n      try(Transaction tx = client.newTransaction()) {\r\n        int currSum = Integer.parseInt(tx.gets(args[0], SUM_COL,\"0\"));\r\n        int newSum = currSum+1;\r\n        tx.set(args[0], SUM_COL, newSum+\"\");\r\n        tx.commit();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Set sum to \"+newSum);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd do the following to quickly build a jar.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone -b fluo-tour https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/fluo-website fluo-tour\r\ncd fluo-tour/\r\n# copy Increment.java to src/main/java/ft\r\nmvn package\r\n# jar will be in target dir\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/339999039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/340029271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/956#issuecomment-340029271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/956","id":340029271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDAyOTI3MQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-27T17:07:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T17:07:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kpm1985 I squashed and merged.

Test this by requesting loc groups using Accumulo public API.\r\n * That iterators were properly setup after init.  Test this by getting tablets iters using public API.  \r\n\r\nThese test could possibly be done in FluoAdminImplIT.\r\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to test manually is because I had angst about the copied code from Accumulo.  If iterators were not properly set, then other ITs would probably catch that.  However if loc groups were not properly set, nothing would catch that (it would just cause performance problems).  So I think checking loc gorups after init is a good test even w/o these changes.

Both approaches would have the following.\r\n\r\n  * An internal class called AsyncGet that contains a RowColumn and CompletableFuture\r\n  * A per transaction queue of AyncGet objects\r\n  * Whenever getAsycn is called on a transaction it creates an AsyncGet object and adds it to the queue\r\n  * Something eventually processes the queue by taking all AsyncGet objects and calling the existing `get(Collection<RowColumn>)` method and uses the results to complete all of the futures.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two approaches is how the queue is processed.  Below are two ways I have been thinking of processing the queue.\r\n\r\n   * There is a single threaded executor service per transaction (created 1st time getAsync is called).  Each time something is added to the queue a task is also added to the executor service.  What the task does is take everything that is present on the queue processes it as described above.  When a transaction is closed, this service is stopped.\r\n   * The first time anything tries to use the result of any completable future returned by getAsync, then everything in the queue is processed.  Ideally this would be done by the thread executing the transaction and trying to use the future.  However I am not sure this approach is even possible.  I have not had enough time to explore CompeltableFuture in depth, but from what I have seen so far this approach does not seem possible.  I am writing it up because I think its the ideal approach, but may not be possible with CompletableFuture.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/343345665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/343484099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/960#issuecomment-343484099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/960","id":343484099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzQ4NDA5OQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-10T14:14:59Z","updated_at":"2017-11-10T14:14:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Rebase'd and squashed commits, in prep for merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/343484099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/343697432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/530#issuecomment-343697432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/530","id":343697432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzY5NzQzMg==","user":{"login":"srikailash","id":6986624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODY2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6986624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash","html_url":"https://github.com/srikailash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srikailash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-11T22:07:38Z","updated_at":"2017-11-11T22:07:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey mikewalch , i am interested to work on this issue .

Each node in ZK can have an auth set.  Accumulo sets auths in ZK and Fluo does optionally with the changes in #899. The paths in the error messages `/fluo/impl-test4` lead me to believe its executing Fluo code when this happens.

I am still puzzling out the async story for Fluo.  Currently there are a few areas I have identified and opened issue about.\r\n\r\n * To really get good throughput from async Fluo operations, I feel Accumulo itself needs to be modified to offer async APIs for reading a writing data.  #651 #675\r\n * For Fluo workers, the number of concurrent transaction could be limited by what will fit into memory instead of the number of threads.  Offering async observers allows Fluo to process as many notifications as will fit into memory instead of limiting it to an arbitrary number of threads as it currently does #968.  This could lead to much higher throughput in conjunction with #651 and #675.\r\n * For loading data, Fluo should offer async operations #795.  Need to test this by implementing use cases of loading data using Kafka. This could lead to much higher throughput in conjunction with #651 and #675.\r\n * Internally Fluo uses a quasi asynchronous commit process.  This was written using Guava's Listenable futures.  Now that Fluo is using Java 8 this needs to be converted to CompletableFuture. #722","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/347307505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/347378967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/722#issuecomment-347378967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/722","id":347378967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzM3ODk2Nw==","user":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T00:58:57Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T00:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since I just got some experience using CompletableFutures I'd like to give this a shot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/347378967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/347401335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/971#issuecomment-347401335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/971","id":347401335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzQwMTMzNQ==","user":{"login":"cjmctague","id":20524292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI0Mjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20524292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague","html_url":"https://github.com/cjmctague","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T03:18:02Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T03:18:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My environment currently is on a mid 2012 macOS laptop with the latest version that the issues are occurring on.
