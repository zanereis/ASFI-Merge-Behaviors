There are `isOffline` checks throughout the resolvers, that should prevent the connection attempt complete (and fail with a different exception), but they not trigger for some reason.\r\n\r\nI am still not clear on why this thing even happens.

As it is now, it's almost random. You can define proxy environment variables but end up using mostly direct connections. It's a race, but instead of the first one winning, the last one to get to the instruction `conn[0] = test` before being terminated wins!\r\n\r\n> If we end up deciding to change this to an sequential approach, I believe we should use one task which does all sequentially.

For example, the values of the proxy variables are not going to change during the build, so the code should get them just once from the environment instead of 565 times. Furthermore, I think the build should fail when the `http_proxy` doesn't work, for example, instead of moving on to try the value of `https_proxy` and then even a direct connection.\r\n\r\nI thought we could follow-up with a bigger design change once we have some experience with this small change.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1149285133/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1149739890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4205#issuecomment-1149739890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4205","id":1149739890,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Eh6Ny","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T10:27:09Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T10:27:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Generally looks good.

That's a minor concern nowadays.\r\n\r\nI thought about that too and came to same conclusion. Because in theory selecting cpu arch in a filter could be done by the IDE (default choice is already picked by the IDE). But i added the filter anyway for three reasons:\r\n\r\n - there might not always be a 1:1 mapping between JDK build and user hardware (see old 32bit builds etc)\r\n - its difficult to figure out what the system can actually run. For example my workstation here (64 bit linux kernel) can also run aarch64 (and more) since i have qemu configured that way. I can run aarch64 containers before deploying them to raspis or server grade arm systems. Mac + rossetta would be another example.\r\n - even without installing anything, the tool might be useful as simple JDK browser. (\"which JDKs still run on X\").

Thus this can be seen as an emergency correction when the autodetection fails or is not present because of an unknown language.\r\nAs this is something the user should not need to change, I'd shade it by default and prepend a check-box that would make it active. In any case, it's preferred to correct the class detection mechanism when such an issue appears.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1151137323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1151258449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2622#issuecomment-1151258449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2622","id":1151258449,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Ens9R","user":{"login":"Rahul-khandelwal","id":22575469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTc1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22575469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal","html_url":"https://github.com/Rahul-khandelwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rahul-khandelwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T15:18:00Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T15:18:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pitching here.
