It's been bumpy for upgrades these last few months.\r\n\r\nWe have a upstream dependency for Jackson for jsonld-java. I don't think any of Jena code directly uses the Jackson code. Now, Jena and jsonld-java don't actually use the part of databind that has been under attack, but it is easy to upgrade so if jena uses use jackson directly, they get the fixes.\r\n\r\njsonld-java is currently depending on 2.9.9 (core) and 2.9.9.2 (databind). Jena takes control of the exact version because of the releases for CVE's, giving us fine grained control (2.9.9.x) without needing to wait for jsonld-java to release, assuming x.x.x.+1 is fix-only.\r\n\r\nIn my $job, some customers scan jars and match against the CVE database. I'm sure they aren't the only ones. It is easier to upgrade that explain why the CVE does not affect the code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/533829343/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/533867036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/605#issuecomment-533867036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/605","id":533867036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzg2NzAzNg==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-22T10:01:42Z","updated_at":"2019-09-22T10:01:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Claudenw -

- thank you very much for working on this and the discussion. The more eyes on concurrency and transaction issues the better.\r\n\r\nThis approach looks like a good one.\r\nI think it can be simplified and remove some lock use. \r\n\r\n1/\r\nThe principle that when there is a writer, only the writer can update the not-present cache is good. When there isn't a writer, any reader can update the not-present cache and there is no need to track the data version that I can see. This is because, when there is no writer, the readers can see the whole node table. If they find a node/nodeid but it isn't in the RDF data, all that happens is that use in a triple pattern fails. The not-present cache just speeds that up; that cache don't have to be very large either.\r\n\r\nSo the rule is either its the active writer, or any reader and no writer active.\r\n\r\n```\r\n private boolean inTopLevelTxn() {\r\n        Transaction t = txn.get();\r\n        if ( t == null )\r\n            return false;\r\n        // Either t is the write transaction or is a reader and no W txn is active. \r\n        if ( t.isWriteTxn() ) \r\n            return true;\r\n        return !hasActiveWriteTransaction.get(); \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2/\r\n\r\nThat means `hasActiveWriteTransaction` can be a `AtomicBoolean`, is managed in `updateStart`/`updateCommit`/`updateAbort`. This removes the need for synchronized because only one value is needed.\r\n\r\nI've made these changes for discussion on a scratch branch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/jena/compare/master...afs:jena1785_tdb2_misscache\r\n\r\nTwo commits - the first is PR646, the second is the suggestions above - commit message \"AFS-PR646\" and currently commit https://github.com/apache/jena/commit/d7063a3ad5aa2751a57b8e3356b2fee122f45595\r\n\r\n3/\r\nThere are changes in the test suite to build a test dataset with smaller cache sizes. Then the caches can be fully cycled in a reasonable time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/562860832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/562942701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/646#issuecomment-562942701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/646","id":562942701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjk0MjcwMQ==","user":{"login":"strangepleasures","id":14973789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTczNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14973789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures","html_url":"https://github.com/strangepleasures","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-08T12:26:02Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T12:26:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for your warm words.\r\n\r\nI totally agree with your suggestions. \r\nThere's no need to check dataVersion indeed. In principle, we don't even need to store a whole transaction or have a separate field for hasActiveWriteTransaction, it could be just one `AtomicReference<Thread> writingThread`.\r\n\r\nI introduced explicit synchronization because I was afraid of a potential race condition. Without synchronization in `notifyTxnStart` a new write transaction can be started immediately after you check hasActiveWriteTransaction:\r\n```\r\n // in a read transaction\r\n if ( notPresent != null && inTopLevelTxn()) // inTopLevelTxn() == true\r\n // a new write transaction is started in another thread, making the read transaction not top level anymore\r\n                notPresent.put(node, Boolean.TRUE);\r\n```\r\nHowever, it seems to be no problem. Even if a new write transaction is started, it will not be able to allocate a new node while the lock is being held by the read transaction. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/562942701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/562954480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/646#issuecomment-562954480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/646","id":562954480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjk1NDQ4MA==","user":{"login":"strangepleasures","id":14973789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTczNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14973789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures","html_url":"https://github.com/strangepleasures","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strangepleasures/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-08T14:31:54Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T14:31:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A version based on your branch but with only one volatile field \r\n```\r\n/*\r\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n * or more contributor license agreements.

The name was also changed to reflect the actual hashing method being implemented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/576153847/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/576452376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/674#issuecomment-576452376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/674","id":576452376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQ1MjM3Ng==","user":{"login":"galbiston","id":4662258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjIyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4662258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston","html_url":"https://github.com/galbiston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galbiston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T22:47:31Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T22:47:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Andy, \r\n\r\nSince this changes the pom.xml for the GeoSPARQL module I thought you might want to check over and test.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGreg","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/576452376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/577198581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/667#issuecomment-577198581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/667","id":577198581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzE5ODU4MQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T14:10:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T14:10:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed in favour of #673 (use murmur3 128 bit because it is the same length as MD5).\r\n\r\n@NSeydoux -

The conversion was pretty straight-forward, and everything seems to work nicely. I have three suggestions for additions to this PR.\r\n\r\n1. The `JenaCommonsRDF` class has a `o.a.c.rdf.api.Dataset fromJena(o.a.j.sparql.core.Dataset)` converter but no converter in the other direction. I would suggest adding something like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static org.apache.jena.sparql.core.DatasetGraph toJena(Dataset dataset) {\r\n    if ( dataset instanceof JenaDataset )\r\n        return ((JenaDataset)dataset).getDataset();\r\n    org.apache.jena.sparql.core.DatasetGraph d = DatasetGraphFactory.createGeneral();\r\n    dataset.stream().forEach(q->d.add(toJena(q)));\r\n    return d;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `JenaRDF` class in `commons-rdf-jena` also has converters to/from `o.a.c.rdf.api.Syntax`/`o.a.j.riot.Lang`. Those would be great to add to the `JenaCommonsRDF` class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static Optional<Lang> toJena(final RDFSyntax syntax) {\r\n    return Optional.ofNullable(RDFLanguages.contentTypeToLang(syntax.mediaType()));\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static Optional<RDFSyntax> fromJena(final Lang lang) {\r\n    return RDFSyntax.byMediaType(lang.getContentType().getContentType());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.
