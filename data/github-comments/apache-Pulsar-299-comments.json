the first need is to qualify the current behavior if is it correct or must be reviewed.\r\n\r\nWhen the consumer is subscribed to a pattern it is behavior is correct since is does not recreate the topics and when topics are created or deleted it changes its subscriptions automatically (discovery)\r\n\r\nthe \"odd\" behavior is noticed when it is subscribed to a partitioned topic:\r\n\r\n- When the topic is deleted forcefully with auto-creation, it recreates regular topics with the same names as the deleted partitions and not as partitioned topic. Also it does not subscribe to these topics. Is it correct doing so ? Naively, I would suggest that it must recreate a partitioned topic as it was.\r\n- When the topic is deleted forcefully with auto-creation disabled, \r\n      - it detects that and ignores it with error message (See MultiTopicsConsumerImpl.subscribeIncreasedTopicPartitions). It treats only the case of increasing partitions as the method name suggests.\r\n      - And when the topic is recreated manually:\r\n          -  with the same partitions number ==> it does nothing since it compares the number registered in the consumer with the current number of the topics partitions.\r\n          - With a bigger partition number ==> it subscribes to the new partitions but does not resubscribe to the old ones.\r\n              ==> is this correct as behavior? Naively, I would suggest that the consumer must resubscribe to the new topic automatically or exits, if there is no active subscription, to allow an auto-relaunch for example.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781881135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781883953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9343#issuecomment-781883953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9343","id":781883953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTg4Mzk1Mw==","user":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T07:17:12Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T07:17:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing

The README could be updated at that time to also cover the feature of this current PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781985894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781987292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9621#issuecomment-781987292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9621","id":781987292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTk4NzI5Mg==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T10:31:17Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T10:31:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781987292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781991274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9627#issuecomment-781991274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9627","id":781991274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTk5MTI3NA==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T10:38:29Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T10:44:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I wonder how to share the docker image between different jobs?\r\n\r\n@zymap The high level idea is described in the [draft PIP Changes to GitHub Actions based Pulsar CI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNEWD3COdnNGMiryO9qBUW_83qtzAhqjDI5wwmPD-YE/edit?usp=sharing). It's possible by using the GitHub Actions Cache. There's [an action that adds a local HTTP proxy](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/http-cache-proxy) to the cache where you can POST and GET any key from the cache. I've been experimenting with it and it's really great and efficient. I'll share the results on the mailing list asap (next week).\r\n\r\ndocker comes with `docker save` and `docker load` commands which allow to export an image to a stream of bytes. I've been experimenting with a solution where I pipe this to zstd compressor and with curl over http-cache-proxy to GitHub Actions Cache. It's pretty stable, however sometimes the upload or download fails. I'll add retries to address that issue.\r\n\r\nbtw. The challenge with `docker save` is that it saves all layers. It also saves the `openjdk:8-jdk-slim` layers which could be pulled directly, however that's not a big concern since the size of `openjdk:8-jdk-slim` is 288MB uncompressed. This is a small portion of the total image size of `pulsar-test-latest-version` image. There are solutions to hack around the limitation, but they are fairly complex.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781991274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782000823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9614#issuecomment-782000823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9614","id":782000823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjAwMDgyMw==","user":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T10:57:26Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T10:57:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

It makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nI agree with this, in addition, this setting should be configureable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782099580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782108397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9624#issuecomment-782108397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9624","id":782108397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjEwODM5Nw==","user":{"login":"Renkai","id":3381789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODE3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3381789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai","html_url":"https://github.com/Renkai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T14:27:07Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T14:27:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782108397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782133879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9626#issuecomment-782133879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9626","id":782133879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjEzMzg3OQ==","user":{"login":"bsideup","id":1050762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup","html_url":"https://github.com/bsideup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsideup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T15:09:23Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:09:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lhotari TBH I would advice against this approach.

In this case, the changes in this PR aren't meant to be used in CI at all. The reason to leave the container running is to debug an issue locally.

At least, that's how I've been using it in the past. \r\n\r\nWould you also recommend using the reusable container mode for also for the debugging use case that I have described? I guess that would require also enabling `testcontainers.reuse.enable` in `~/.testcontainers.properties`?  \r\n\r\nI have one concern. The problem with reusable container mode is that it impacts the execution when a container gets reused. I'd simply like to leave the containers after the test and the test JVM completes so that I could open a shell to the container and inspect the state. Perhaps this would be a feature request for Testcontainers? \r\nIs there a workaround with reusable containers by adding a random label to the container etc so that the container would never get

When the topic is deleted forcefully with auto-creation, it recreates regular topics with the same names as the deleted partitions and not as partitioned topic. Also it does not subscribe to these topics. Is it correct doing so ? Naively, I would suggest that it must recreate a partitioned topic as it was.\r\n\r\nYes, the current behavior is recreating \"partitions\" since the consumer already subscribed to each partition. For the partitioned topic, the consumer fetches the partitioned metadata first then subscribes to each partition. Do you mean the partitions are created but the consumer does not subscribe to them? This is not expected behavior. If you want to recreate a partitioned topic you can change the topic auto-create mode to 'partitioned' in the broker.conf `allowAutoTopicCreationType`.\r\n\r\n>  it detects that and ignores it with error message (See MultiTopicsConsumerImpl.subscribeIncreasedTopicPartitions). It treats only the case of increasing partitions as the method name suggests.\r\n\r\nThis handles the partitions scaling. This will not affect the reconnect behavior. Essentially, the re-subscribe is processed in each consumer(under multi-topic consumer).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782479524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/782548881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9388#issuecomment-782548881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9388","id":782548881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjU0ODg4MQ==","user":{"login":"congbobo184","id":39078850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDc4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39078850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184","html_url":"https://github.com/congbobo184","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-20T03:20:38Z","updated_at":"2021-02-20T03:20:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot
