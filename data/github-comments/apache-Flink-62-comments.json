The tests here run, because the operator is executed in isolation, with no other memory consuming operators in the test program.\n\nMemory consumers need to be known to the Optimizer (in the program generation) to compute what maximal fraction of memory a certain consumer may request. That value is part of the Task's configuration and used by the memory consumer to obtain the right maximum amount.\n\nIntegrating operators into the optimizer's planning is a bit tedious and not as easy as it could be (we did not get around to refactoring this so far, unfortunately). Maybe we can add some tooling that would mark a UDF as MemoryConsuming and would in that case expose a Memory Allocator that returns the right amount of memory.\n\nWhat we could do is the following: I will try to get to refactoring some of the Managed Memory Allocation abstractions (we need this anyways for more components) and then expose a MemoryAllocator in the runtime context, which is accessible if a user-defined function has been annotated as a memory consumer.\n\nThis may take me two weeks (I am currently in the mids of working on the streaming windows), but if you don't mind letting this rest for some days, I think that is the cleanest approach.\n\nThe other parts of the code look good, so after I finish my part, it should be a simple rebase of the TopKMapPartition function and the TopKReducer, and then this is good to merge.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/142672766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/142676424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1174#issuecomment-142676424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1174","id":142676424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjY3NjQyNA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T17:44:58Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T17:44:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I will merge this then.

Going for a `GenericeTypeInfo` would work in many cases but unfortunately not in all. For example `union` operates in Flink on serialization level and requires that all data sets which are unioned use the same serializer. By transparently using a `GenericTypeInfo` users might be surprised why `DataSet<Tuple2<String,Long>.union(DataSet<Tuple2<String,Long>)` does not work. If we only support OuterJoins with an explicit JoinFunction, the user has full control how to deal with null values and can even use a custom Tuple type or Tuple serializer (via `Operator.returns()`) that supports null values. In my opinion, the best approach is to only support OuterJoins with JoinFunctions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/142723198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/142753142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1174#issuecomment-142753142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1174","id":142753142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjc1MzE0Mg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-23T22:49:06Z","updated_at":"2015-09-23T22:49:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hsaputra I think the wiki page is not correct any more.

Here the generic parameters have the same naming convention as class names.\n\nI think we have to standardize a bit here. :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/142940983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/142941895","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1175#issuecomment-142941895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1175","id":142941895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Mjk0MTg5NQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-24T14:11:10Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T14:11:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not super attached.

the reason why I introduced the `CommonCSVInputFormat` instead of unifying it with the `GenericCsvInputFormat` was that we still have the Record API `CsvInputFormat` in the code base. It doesn't need the pojo type information and, thus, I thought that it does not make sense to let it inherit from a class which has these fields. Actually, I would be in favour of removing the Record API's `CsvInputFormat` if possible. Moreover, I would like to more cleanly separate the tuple type `CsvInputFormat` and the pojo type `CsvInputFormat`, because the pojo support was kind of hacked into the original `CsvInputFormat`.

Just to clarify: I did not apply any changes \"just for fun\". But I agree that this PR contains more changes as are actually related to this PR. For example, I wrote some tests according to the given \"test pattern\" of a package and was told that this test pattern should be changed. This also covers catching exceptions... So if this changes are \"wrong\" I was instructed not correctly. In order to \"clean up\" I changed the test pattern not just for my own new tests, but for the whole package (this might have been over eagerly...) Anyway, I agree, that this PR should be split and the changes to the tests should go into an own PR -- we can discuss what changes for the tests makes sense or not there.\n\nHow STOP works:\n- `stop` signal is only sent to streaming source tasks\n- thus, batch jobs and streaming jobs are distinguished now (for batch jobs, no stop signal can be triggered at all)\n- only streaming sources implement `Stoppable` interface and receive stop signal\n- there is no explicit state change necessary -- after streaming tasks return from \"run\", the sources automatically go to \"finishing\" and close there output channels which propagates through the whole ExecutionGraph and all tasks finish automatically. Thus the overall job is marked as SUCCESS and not FAILED\n- for the JobManager UI, sources set a flag that they received the stop signal (which is displayed with a checkmark). This might be helpful, if it take some time before a source actually returns from `run()` and switches from RUNNING into FINISHING (otherwise, the user has no feedback if STOP was issued or not)\n\nAbout `stop()` vs `cancel()`: we need a dedicated stop signal because the stop signal only goes to streaming sources (and no other tasks) and does no trigger an explicit state change. For the user function, I used `cancel()` in the beginning, and was told the you agreed an the introduction of `stop()` method. So I just introduced it at the very last. I think there are some differences (see the JavaDoc I added for stop and cancel) so `UDF.stop()` might be useful (I think on exactly-once guartentee). If a job is canceled, it is a hard stop and exactly-once must not be preserved (tuples emitted by source are not processed as all tasks of the job get canceled at the same time). Not so for stop which gives exactly-once; the job is shut-down cleanly from the sources to the sinks and all data emitted by sources gets processed.\n\nAbout whitespace formatting: there might be a few, but a lot of changes look like WS formatting but are not. This happens, if a whole block is removed (I did remove some try-catch-blocks) and if there are empty line (with to WS indention) within the block. The diff does not display the changes nicely and consecutive line look like WS formatting even if there are not (there was a tap remove due to the removed block). I enable auto-formatting in eclipse only for lines I changed...\n\nI will split and update this PR and we can than take if from there.

One way to do this would be to return a special `OuterJoinOperatorSetsPredicate` object when `.where()` is called. This `OuterJoinOperatorSetsPredicate` does not return a `JoinOperator` when `equalTo()` is called but an unfinished outer join that only allows to call `with()`. That way, the regular join API would remain stable.

We are trying to make our Scala code more consistent. Mostly, I didn't comment everything, just one particular pattern of code that could be changed.\n\nNow, for the technical part, you are not actually removing the predicates that are pushed down from an expression, correct? This should be alright, since the result will still be correct. It might just be some future optimization, but I also think that the cost of evaluating the predicate is negligible. The real improvement comes from early filtering in the sources, as you implemented. \n\nThen, why do you have the `supports*` methods in `AdaptiveTableSource`. Couldn't these methods just do nothing in case the source does not support the feature. Or maybe return false if the pushdown was not successful. (I also wonder why you have the differentiation between AdaptiveSources that support pushdown and those that don't in `JavaBatchTranslator.createTable`. (I think you do it so that stuff does not get pushed to sources that don't support it, but this distinction might not be necessary, as mentioned above.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143703367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143705252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1156#issuecomment-143705252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1156","id":143705252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzcwNTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"MoeweX","id":5738978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzg5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5738978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX","html_url":"https://github.com/MoeweX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoeweX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T10:42:34Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T10:42:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI: styling issues fixed, I will now extend my documentation and have a look at the <code>mapWithBcSet</code> method.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143705252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143713277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1185#issuecomment-143713277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1185","id":143713277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzcxMzI3Nw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T11:02:43Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T11:02:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, looks good.\n\nI think the ports / URLs were in there, because originally we had two backend servers running (the old one and the new one) while gradually transitioning requests and adding more REST requests.

Sorry for the bad Scala style. This was my first really large Scala code project I wrote (not just small scripts), I'm still learning by doing ;) I will correct the issues you mentioned.\n\nFor the technical part: Yes, I don't modify the expression tree, I'm just giving the sources the possibility to adapt to the need of the program. Regarding the `supports*` methods, yes you are right, actually they are not necessary, but I thought it makes sense for possible future table sources to check that in advance. In some cases it also reduces the amout of some method calls, but I can also remove the `supports*` methods for reason of simplicity, no problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143718074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/143718845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1184#issuecomment-143718845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1184","id":143718845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzcxODg0NQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T11:35:41Z","updated_at":"2015-09-28T11:35:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Very nice.
