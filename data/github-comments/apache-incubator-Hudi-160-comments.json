Let's forget about temporal storage, database backups etc. for a minute. Can we use Hudi to store all database events without significant write amplification and without making assumptions about nature of the data itself?\r\n\r\nI mean imagine raw stream of data change events from CDC or something else - transaction log - long append-only table. Can we have this with Hudi effectively? Because what I've seen now while experimenting Hudi would create a complete copy of entire partition (gigabytes to terabytes depending how we partitioned) every time few new rows are added or modified. It does not matter COW or MOR - former would create a copy instantly, while the latter would do this every few minutes on compaction step. And what I need is the ability to append records to the table indefinitely, without write amplification, partition data by creation date and shedule compaction only after all the data for current day has been ingested.  Hystorical querying is not needed here as the data is append-only. Can we shedule MOR compactions to run once a day instead every few minutes as it is now to reduce write amplification? Once we have tables storing complete transaction log we may think about derived tables.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/940832604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/940888966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3787#issuecomment-940888966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3787","id":940888966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44FNOG","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-12T10:43:06Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T14:07:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"d80bc60e3943da3aa0c9309e8bb63d38edf0cd04\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2594\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"d80bc60e3943da3aa0c9309e8bb63d38edf0cd04\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"2e13ee5b2758d0c37ea731219ff453196afa5868\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2596\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"2e13ee5b2758d0c37ea731219ff453196afa5868\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"d1f847d4bc54f9ee4d2d4ae075dba3279bbf53f0\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2597\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"d1f847d4bc54f9ee4d2d4ae075dba3279bbf53f0\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"d1f847d4bc54f9ee4d2d4ae075dba3279bbf53f0\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2605\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"941915874\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"MANUAL\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"ae591eb1a5f41f5f6ffa659b9c96019377a9644b\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2606\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"ae591eb1a5f41f5f6ffa659b9c96019377a9644b\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"b1469e98b5cb216a33bb57d16ac8723664794655\",\n    \"status\" : \"DELETED\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2610\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"b1469e98b5cb216a33bb57d16ac8723664794655\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"c2977e46620d25814c598b04ab90adfe2dd23a23\",\n    \"status\" : \"FAILURE\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2620\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"c2977e46620d25814c598b04ab90adfe2dd23a23\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* c2977e46620d25814c598b04ab90adfe2dd23a23 Azure: [FAILURE](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2620) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

So, as you have figured out, commit times in hudi are generated when actual write happens and hence may not be able to leverage the point in time query. \r\nBut atleast you should be able to do a regular sql query with some filtering (select * from hudi_tbl where timestamp_col >= x and timestamp_col <= y).\r\nI understand this may not be as performant as you would want to. But atleast it is doable. On this end, we are actively working on adding [column range/stats index](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC-27+Data+skipping+index+to+improve+query+performance) which could assist in skipping lot of data while reading. so, this should be more performant once we have this stats index available for your column of interest. In the mean time, lets see if anyone else in the community has more options around this. \r\n\r\nwrt your question on MOR compaction:\r\nCompaction is totally configurable. You can configure to run once per day as you requested ([link1](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/compact/strategy/DayBasedCompactionStrategy.java), [link2](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#Compaction-Configs)\r\n\r\nbut I am bit confused on your use-case. At the beginning you mentioned, it's append only, but in one of the later statements you had mentioned \"few new rows are added or **modified**\". Can you please clarify whether its append only (just inserts) or modifications too? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/943647509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/943647799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3756#issuecomment-943647799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3756","id":943647799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44Puw3","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T19:12:39Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T19:12:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhasudha : just incase you have any ideas.

All database change events are written in append-only MOR Hudi table. To do this I set 'hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field' to the combination of timestamp (generated on the fly from database) and all table primary keys to guarantee uniqueness.  It seems like overkill as we don't really need unique keys for append-only table and I will experiment if 'hoodie.datasource.write.operation': 'insert' can be used to guarantee the records are appended to the Hudi table even if there are duplicates of Hudi keys. We need to preserve all database events for future analytics.\r\n2. Then we create a derived Hudi table with keys equal to DB table's primary keys and use incremental query to upsert new records from the upstream table into this derived table. This table represents a database snapshot (with some historical query functionality). This derived table is 'append & update', so the storage organization is what concerns me but I think I'll work it out soon.\r\n\r\nOne comment:\r\nIt really took me quite some time today to find out that Spark DataFrame column of type timestamp (TimestampType) needs parsing to be used as a timestamp column for partitioning by setting:\r\n```\r\n                'hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timestamp.type': 'SCALAR',\r\n                'hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.output.dateformat': 'yyyy-MM-dd',\r\n                'hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timestamp.scalar.time.unit': 'microseconds',\r\n                'hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timezone': 'GMT',\r\n```\r\nGuys, it's a timestamp, it's already typed and does not need parsing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the great work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/943970605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/944052622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3203#issuecomment-944052622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3203","id":944052622,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44RRmO","user":{"login":"xiarixiaoyao","id":13514703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE0NzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13514703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao","html_url":"https://github.com/xiarixiaoyao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T07:06:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T07:06:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danny0405
