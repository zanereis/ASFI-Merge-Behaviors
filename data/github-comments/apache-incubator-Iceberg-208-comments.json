The problem is that with `ManifestWriter writer` you could technically end up in a situation where the `writer` gets a `DeleteFile` or any other type at runtime, which would break at **runtime**. Providing the generic type the `ManifestWriter` is writing will cause a **compile-time** issue, simply because a `ManifestWriter<DataFile> writer` can't  be supplied a `DeleteFile`.\r\nThat being said, it is always a good practice to specify the generic type in `<>` order to avoid such issues and the application breaking at runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1300110052/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1300269495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5376#issuecomment-1300269495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5376","id":1300269495,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85NgIm3","user":{"login":"chenjunjiedada","id":3960228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjAyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3960228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada","html_url":"https://github.com/chenjunjiedada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-02T12:20:46Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T12:20:46Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Really nice PR, thanks @szehon-ho and @aokolnychyi for the effort!
