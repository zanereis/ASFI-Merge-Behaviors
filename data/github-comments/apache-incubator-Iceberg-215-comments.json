I think I addressed most of them.\r\n\r\nThe changes since the last patch:\r\n- Made the MultiDimensionCounter non-generic.\r\n- The MultiDimensionCounter receives a name in the constructor.\r\n- The key for the internal counters is created from the MultiDimensionCounter name plus the name of the dimension.\r\n- Made a MultiDimensionCounter interface plus a DefaultMultiDimensionCounter implementation for it.\r\n- There is a NOOP implementation as well.\r\n- The DefaultMultiDimensionCounter lives in ScanMetrics but is created through MetricsContext. I believe this is in line with how the other Counters and Timers are handled.\r\n- The counters for the dimensions still live within the DefaultMultiDimensionCounter internally, but they are also created through MetricsContext. I figured this is the most natural way to represent the multi-dimensions.\r\n- The MultiDimensionCounterResult has a function to aggregate the results for all dimensions.\r\n- Updated the existing tests to cover the new counters, also to/from Json conversions are taken care. All tests should pass now.\r\n- Wrote some new tests as well to have more coverage on the new code.\r\n\r\nWhat is remaining:\r\nCurrently there is only support for one dimension. I still have to figure out how this would look like having more than one dimensions. I think it has to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- The number of dimensions should be decided during instantiation of the multi-counter. Maybe constructor param?\r\n- The increase() and value() functions should make sure that they receive as many \"dimension key\"s as many dimensions were decided in the constructor.\r\n- The key for the internal counters could be constructed from the name of the multi-counter plus appending the name of the dimensions. I think this should be enough to have unique keys when creating through MetricsContext.\r\n- The order of the dimensions matters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1335193062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1335228779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5376#issuecomment-1335228779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5376","id":1335228779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Plflr","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-02T13:19:58Z","updated_at":"2022-12-02T13:19:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@RussellSpitzer

I personally like `SELECT * FROM prod.db.table.history` too, but unfortunately, flink does not support this syntax, and it always discards `.history`.
