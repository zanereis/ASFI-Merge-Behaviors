a bit reluctant to merge this. Quite frankly, it neither no license, nor the create commons license sound like a good idea for a document, that is used as a basis for parsers. For our use case I'd try to stay away from this as far as possible. I propose a different approach:\r\n\r\nThe only really interesting think that is part of the DTD are the entity definitions, that are needed to correctly parse the XML stream. The rest is plain XML and the document structure is already manually handled and the stream is also not validated.\r\n\r\nFrom the RSS DTD:\r\n\r\n> Copied from HTML 3.2 DTD, with modifications (removed CDATA)\r\n\r\nNow the entities covered by HTML 3.2 are identical with Character entity set of XHTML 1.0 (this is important, as the HTML 3.2 entity definitions are SGML and the XML parser can't read them).\r\n\r\nThat entity definition was already merged into the apache netbeans codebase with #240.\r\n\r\nSo this assumes, that `xhtml-lat1.ent` is copied from `html.editor` to `welcome` module and placed in the `org.netbeans.modules.welcome.resources` package.\r\n\r\nThere are two places where XMLReader are instantiated (one in `RSSFeed.java` and one in `CombinationRSSFeed.java`). My hack does this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        reader.setEntityResolver( org.openide.xml.EntityCatalog.getDefault() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nis replaced by:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        reader.setEntityResolver( new EntityResolver() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public InputSource resolveEntity(String publicId, String systemId) throws SAXException, IOException {\r\n                if(\"http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-0.91.dtd\".equals(systemId)\r\n                        || \"-//Netscape Communications//DTD RSS 0.91//EN\".equals(publicId)) {\r\n                    return new InputSource(RSSFeed.class.getResourceAsStream(\"/org/netbeans/modules/welcome/resources/xhtml-lat1.ent\"));\r\n                } else {\r\n                    return org.openide.xml.EntityCatalog.getDefault().resolveEntity(publicId, systemId);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        } );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I pretend to handle the XML parser the correct DTD, but that DTD only contains entity definitions and misses the structure information. The structural aspects are handled in `FeedHandler` inside `RSSFeed` which does not depend on the information from the DTD.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/341937684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/341955624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/225#issuecomment-341955624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/225","id":341955624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTk1NTYyNA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-05T07:59:48Z","updated_at":"2017-11-05T07:59:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/341955624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/341962086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/161#issuecomment-341962086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/161","id":341962086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTk2MjA4Ng==","user":{"login":"lbruun","id":32431476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDMxNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32431476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun","html_url":"https://github.com/lbruun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbruun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-05T10:12:29Z","updated_at":"2017-11-05T10:12:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Matthias, your comments are a pleasure to work with. !! \r\nAmazing.

The test case was obviously wrong to begin with and has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n- The `dnsResolveEx()` test failed because it made assumptions about IPv6 being available on the test host and was in any case incorrect to begin with. All tests that use name lookup have now been changed to use the `FakeDns` class, so that tests become independent of the environment of test host. There was quite a few other tests that made such stupid assumptions.\r\n\r\n- Also, if the engine detects an attempt to break out of the sandbox it will now no longer print a stack trace. The stack trace gave the impression that the unit test using `pac-test-sandbox-breakout.js` failed but it really didn't. The stack trace provides no extra information so better to leave it out, I think. Not all log messages benefit from a stack trace.
