Thought of doing this also. It ran in more code changes with two exposed function in PinotClientTransportFactory.java  and its implementation in concrete classes. Following the same type of separation for class JsonAsyncHttpPinotClientTransport, it also needs to have two constructors. \r\n\r\n With this in mind, I felt the current approach of having a single function and passing headers as null if not present makes a better fit here. \r\n\r\n  At class ConnectionFactory entry point level, there is extra function two pass headers. Older ones are kept as it is for backward compatibility.  Any thoughts are welcomed

If user doesn't specify a defaultNullValue, we use \"default\" values (as mentioned in the description of this issue as well as confirmed by @mcvsubbu in one of the comments). The problem with the \"default\" defaultNullValues is that they can result in **incorrect** behavior for metrics or dimensions. I think it is important that this be corrected as we attempt to build presence vectors. Here is the behavior I would like considered going forward:\r\n1. Do not use default defaultNullValues. Use presence vectors to guide decisions in the rest of the exeuction phases as needed.\r\n2. If users specify defaultNullValue, that is used when the data for column is missing; the presence vector in this case does not indicate that the value is \"missing\".\r\n3. To maintain backward compatibility, existing schemas are updated to explicitly add the \"default\" defaultNullValues in the schema. (We may need some versioning info in schema config to direct this correctly).\r\n\r\nIf the above is not acceptable, it would be good to clarify the reasons we think its OK to continue with the existing default defaultNullValues in the face of incorrectness. And we should update the user facing documentation so its clear to users what they can expect.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/497375571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/497411782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/4230#issuecomment-497411782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4230","id":497411782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzQxMTc4Mg==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T17:24:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T17:24:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We should avoid asking users to upgrade schema to maintain backward compatibility. It will be challenging operationally.\r\n\r\nIf I understand you correctly, what you are suggesting is basically the same as my original proposal - adding isNullable field. Instead of adding isNullable explicitly in the fieldSpec you are proposing deriving that based on the presence/absence of defaultNullValue. I prefer having isNullable explicitly instead of deriving it based on defaultNullValue. \r\n\r\nIt might be easier if we break this into two parts and look at the options on the table. Segment Generation and query execution.\r\n\r\nSegment Generation (Creating Presence Vector): Options\r\n1.  Create the presence vector by default for all columns. If the column is present and not null in the row, set the presence bit.\r\n2. Create the presence vector only when isNullable = true  or createPresenceVector = true. By default createPresenceVector = false \r\n3. Same as 2 but derive it based on presence/absence of defaultNullValue\r\n\r\nQuery Execution: Options\r\n1. Let users use x != NULL explicitly in the query to filter out rows with NULL values\r\n2. Pinot automatically uses the presence vector in the query execution as needed.\r\n\r\nNote: We are not going to change what's stored in the forward index. We will always use defaultNullValue (it can be default defaultNullValue based on dataType or something user specifies in the schema).\r\n\r\nI prefer starting with option 2 for Segment Generation and option 1 for Query Execution. This will be backward compatible with current behavior and provide the flexibility to the user to achieve the behavior they want by changing the fieldSpec and query as needed.\r\n\r\nWe can always move to 1 in Segment Generation by changing the default value of createPresenceVector=true in phase 2.  We can also start to move to option 2 for Query Execution over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/497411782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/497413455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/4252#issuecomment-497413455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/4252","id":497413455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzQxMzQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T17:29:40Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T17:29:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am fine with this. @ananthdurai , @kishoreg  anyone have any opinions? @ananthdurai  are you good  in terms of implementing a new adapter for newer versions of kafka?

I agree with him and prefer 0.9.x and I think Kafka guarantees that API's won't change in minor versions.

See Flink naming convention for example https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/flink-connectors.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is to create a subfolder for all implementations if possible.

See Flink naming convention for example https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/master/flink-connectors.\r\n> \r\n> Another suggestion is to create a subfolder for all implementations if possible.
