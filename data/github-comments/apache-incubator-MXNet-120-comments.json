Adding it to module should be pretty straightforward.\n\nI think PandasLogger & LiveBokehChart belong separate for a couple reasons:\n1) I think it'll be useful to attach multiple live charts onto the same training run -- e.g. one showing speed, another showing loss, another showing validation metrics.  Or in some cases we track lots of different validation metrics.  This is easy to do through composition the way the classes are structured -- you instantiate multiple BokehChart objects and connect them to the same PandasLogger.  I imagine there should be other LiveBokehChart sub-classes that make these patterns easy.\n2) The PandasLogger is likely to be useful by itself without any charts.  You can run this without a notebook, and it's trivial (one line of code) to save the dataframe as a .csv for offline analysis of the run.\n\nThat said, I think we can simplify the common case by having the BokehChart instantiate its own PandasLogger if one isn't passed in during construction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255245609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255267950","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3556#issuecomment-255267950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3556","id":255267950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTI2Nzk1MA==","user":{"login":"xlvector","id":100203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector","html_url":"https://github.com/xlvector","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlvector/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-21T01:01:58Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T01:01:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sbodenstein Thanks very much!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255267950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255270768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3581#issuecomment-255270768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3581","id":255270768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTI3MDc2OA==","user":{"login":"zhenlinluo","id":21969145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTY5MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21969145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlinluo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlinluo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-21T01:25:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T01:25:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for suggestion.

Pls refer to https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/anaconda-25-release-now-mkl-optimizations \n\nSince I believe anaconda will integrate the new MKL2017 soon, this issue will disappear automatically. I will put this into README as known issue. Also I will continue to look at this to see if have better w/a. \n\nBut I think this should not block the PR merge, right?

@xlvector: its actually a larger project than I thought at first to write an efficient pad layer for n-dimensional tensors (and won't have time to do it).\n\nThe cases of interest are almost always for images (in which case only two of the four dimensions are padded), so I propose a layer `mx.image_pad`. This takes a tensor `(n, c, h, w)`, and parameters:\n- `mode`: padding mode, can be \"constant\" (pad with 0), \"reflect\", \"replicate\" (same as Torch)\n- `padding`: a matrix `[[pad_top, pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right]]`\n\nIn the future, a layer `mx.pad` could be written that deals with the general case (and will require a more verbose syntax for the common image case). This layer still replicates the [three torch layers](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/convolution.md) `SpatialZeroPadding`, `SpatialReflectionPadding` and `SpatialReplicationPadding`.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255556999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255565156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3594#issuecomment-255565156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3594","id":255565156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTU2NTE1Ng==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-23T02:06:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T02:06:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"you can't access gpu memory from cpu. write a kernel instead\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255565156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255565193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3556#issuecomment-255565193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3556","id":255565193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTU2NTE5Mw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-23T02:08:24Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T02:08:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's stick with mx.pad and make the interface support general padding.

Although the structure of my customized networks is different, I also encountered the same error, i.e. \"Shape of labels does not match shape of predictions\".\n\nI agree with @Godricly  that this is kind of a bug of the metric. Even we have reshaped the label to 1D vector, the metric will use the shape provided by the data batch, i.e. (1, 500,) in your case. Hence, to address this issue, the straight way is to modify your customized DataIter code to make sure the labels provided are a 1D vector.\n\nHowever, if you have labels for each time step, the solution above doesn't work. Here is another ugly trick for both cases. Just modify the codes in the metric.py (of course, you need root/sudo permission) to squeeze the labels. The squeeze function will remove the single dimension. If I remember correctly, there is one line like \"label = labels[i].asnumpy().astype(\"int32\")\". Below it, you could add a new line \"label = label.squeeze()\". I know this sounds crazy, but it works anyway.\n\nHope my reply would help you guys.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/255602047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
