That would allow someone to use shutdown as a way to do an early stop without waiting for taskDuration to elapse - i.e. they spin up a supervisor, pump 1000 messages into it, and then shutdown the supervisor to publish those segments regardless of what taskDuration was set to.\n\nAlthough maybe your point is more that if some tasks are in a bad state and they don't **all** publish their segments (therefore triggering the shutdown timeout), then having incomplete output is the same or worse than having no output at all and it doesn't matter if we kill the publishing tasks in this case -
