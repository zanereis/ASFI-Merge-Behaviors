Below are the results of my tests using the [Non-Modular Maven](https://github.com/openjfx/samples/tree/master/IDE/NetBeans/Non-Modular/Maven) project of the [JavaFX samples](https://github.com/openjfx/samples) repository. Once we resolve the issues with this first project, I can test the other sample projects described in [NETBEANS-3296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-3296).\r\n\r\nI ran the tests with OpenJDK 13.0.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS. I did not install the *nb-javac* plug-in so as to avoid the exceptions it encounters. For the Java Platform Javadoc, I left the default entry created by NetBeans, which lists only the *docs* directory of the JDK.\r\n\r\n![platform-javadoc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421808-cd823f80-0153-11ea-84dd-e438032bd4d6.png)\r\n\r\nBefore downloading the JavaFX Javadoc and Sources, neither were available to NetBeans, as expected.\r\n\r\nI right-clicked the Dependencies node in the Project window and selected *Download Javadoc*. The Javadoc artifacts were downloaded to the local Maven cache under the directory *~/.m2/repository/org/openjfx*.\r\n\r\n```\r\njavafx-base/13.0.1/javafx-base-13.0.1-javadoc.jar\r\njavafx-base/13.0.1/javafx-base-13.0.1-javadoc.jar.sha1\r\njavafx-controls/13.0.1/javafx-controls-13.0.1-javadoc.jar\r\njavafx-controls/13.0.1/javafx-controls-13.0.1-javadoc.jar.sha1\r\njavafx-fxml/13.0.1/javafx-fxml-13.0.1-javadoc.jar\r\njavafx-fxml/13.0.1/javafx-fxml-13.0.1-javadoc.jar.sha1\r\njavafx-graphics/13.0.1/javafx-graphics-13.0.1-javadoc.jar\r\njavafx-graphics/13.0.1/javafx-graphics-13.0.1-javadoc.jar.sha1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Javadoc badges appeared on those dependencies without the *-linux.jar* platform classifier.\r\n\r\n![dependencies-javadoc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421797-cc511280-0153-11ea-9c1d-4c6de8f33044.png)\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the Javadoc then displayed perfectly even before attaching the Sources! I had previously thought that NetBeans always got the Javadoc from the comments in the source code.\r\n\r\nThe Javadoc window showed the full description when selecting the `setScene` method.\r\n\r\n![javadoc-setScene](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421801-cce9a900-0153-11ea-8647-ccafe55520f7.png)\r\n\r\nThe full description was displayed when selecting the `show` method.\r\n\r\n![javadoc-show](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421803-cd823f80-0153-11ea-8741-fa448f451a6a.png)\r\n\r\nClicking the toolbar button to show the documentation in an external Web browser opened my browser to the correct location.\r\n\r\n![browser-setScene](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421794-cc511280-0153-11ea-8523-1572daf7e980.png)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Javadoc for the Java Platform was found with the default entry created by NetBeans. Previously, you had to edit the Platform Javadoc and add the specific Java module directories for the information to display correctly.\r\n\r\n![javadoc-getClass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421800-cce9a900-0153-11ea-88a8-2d87a85659f1.png)\r\n\r\nClicking through to the Sources showed only the Compiled Code, as expected.\r\n\r\n![compiled-code-setScene](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421796-cc511280-0153-11ea-9bfb-abbe3221553c.png)\r\n\r\nNext, I right-clicked the Dependencies node in the Project window and selected *Download Sources*. The Sources artifacts were downloaded to the local Maven cache under the directory *~/.m2/repository/org/openjfx*.\r\n\r\n```\r\njavafx-base/13.0.1/javafx-base-13.0.1-sources.jar\r\njavafx-base/13.0.1/javafx-base-13.0.1-sources.jar.sha1\r\njavafx-controls/13.0.1/javafx-controls-13.0.1-sources.jar\r\njavafx-controls/13.0.1/javafx-controls-13.0.1-sources.jar.sha1\r\njavafx-fxml/13.0.1/javafx-fxml-13.0.1-sources.jar\r\njavafx-fxml/13.0.1/javafx-fxml-13.0.1-sources.jar.sha1\r\njavafx-graphics/13.0.1/javafx-graphics-13.0.1-sources.jar\r\njavafx-graphics/13.0.1/javafx-graphics-13.0.1-sources.jar.sha1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Sources badges appeared on those dependencies without the *-linux.jar* platform qualifier.\r\n\r\n![dependencies-javadoc-sources](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421798-cce9a900-0153-11ea-8a87-31b932717724.png)\r\n\r\nHere I started to see some unexpected behavior. Selecting the `show()` method in the *App.java* file no longer shows the method description as it did before.\r\n\r\n![javadoc-show-no-description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421806-cd823f80-0153-11ea-98c6-3fc0d232364c.png)\r\n\r\nSelecting the `setScene` method still shows the full description in the Javadoc window, but *Ctrl-clicking* the method does not navigate to its location in the source file. It opens the source file with the cursor on the first line, even though it navigated to the correct location in the Compiled Code view previously.\r\n\r\n![source-setScene](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421809-cd823f80-0153-11ea-803d-8bc083ec886e.png)\r\n\r\nTo see what's happening, I deleted the Javadoc from the Maven cache and left just the Sources. I closed and reopened the project.\r\n\r\n![dependencies-sources](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421799-cce9a900-0153-11ea-9b08-693219ec2b55.png)\r\n\r\nNow we see the same problems. The `show` method has no description.\r\n\r\n![javadoc-show-sources-only](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421807-cd823f80-0153-11ea-98d0-492b2a017009.png)\r\n\r\nThe Ant projects in NetBeans 11.2, though, are able to show the Javadoc for this method using only the comments in the source code, as shown in the screenshot below. I expected the Maven project to provide the same information. Note that you can tell whether the Javadoc and Sources are available by looking at whether the corresponding toolbar buttons are enabled. In the images above and below, only the Sources button is enabled. No Javadoc is attached.\r\n\r\n![ant-javadoc-show](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421770-bb080600-0153-11ea-9aa3-0b835b402d9b.png)\r\n\r\nThe `setScene` method displays no Javadoc at all, even though Javadoc comments are available in the source code.\r\n\r\n![javadoc-setScene-sources-only](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1413266/68421802-cce9a900-0153-11ea-90b8-07a21dfeb4b7.png)\r\n\r\nNavigating to the `show` method's source works, but for `setScene` the file still just opens to the first line. The two methods in the source code are defined as follows.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Specify the scene to be used on this stage.\r\n     */\r\n    @Override final public void setScene(Scene value) {\r\n        Toolkit.getToolkit().checkFxUserThread();\r\n        super.setScene(value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * {@inheritDoc}\r\n     */\r\n    @Override public final void show() {\r\n        super.show();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow should the Javadoc be displayed now? I'm guessing at the following algorithm based on the results of the all tests I've been doing here and for [NETBEANS-3296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-3296).\r\n\r\n* If the Javadoc is attached and an entry exists for the selected item, use the HTML to display the Javadoc.\r\n* Otherwise, if the Sources are attached and there are Javadoc comments for the selected item, use those comments to display the Javadoc.\r\n* Otherwise, prompt the user to attach the Javadoc or Sources. In the Javadoc window and code completion, prompt the user to attach the Javadoc. In the Compiled Code view, prompt the user to attach the Sources.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/551237510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/551284949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1613#issuecomment-551284949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1613","id":551284949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTI4NDk0OQ==","user":{"login":"pepness","id":9832133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzIxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9832133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness","html_url":"https://github.com/pepness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T21:58:26Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T21:58:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

I know, easy for me to say. :smiley: We could, however, fix these in pieces and open new issues for those problems.\r\n\r\nI just ran some more tests to make sure that this pull request doesn't break the technique I use to work on the [JavaFX Graphics](https://github.com/jgneff/javafx-graphics) module in NetBeans. The work-around is to create an Ant-based project and add the individual JAR files to the Module or Compile Classpath, attach the appropriate Javadoc and Sources directories to each JAR file, remove the Javadoc and Sources from the Global Library, and uninstall the *nb-javac* plug-in. That still works as described in the *Ant Non-Modular* and *Ant-Modular* sections of [NETBEANS-3296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-3296).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/551340727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/551343327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1108#issuecomment-551343327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1108","id":551343327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTM0MzMyNw==","user":{"login":"pepness","id":9832133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzIxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9832133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness","html_url":"https://github.com/pepness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepness/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T01:30:06Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T01:30:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This

Maybe that precedence could be swapped, using the Sources only when the Javadoc is not available for a selected item. I have not yet found any documentation on exactly how this is supposed to work.

The algorithm to find the javadoc goes as follows:\r\n\r\n1. If there is source for the code element attached, try to use that first (this happens in [ElementJavadoc::getElementDoc](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.sourceui/src/org/netbeans/api/java/source/ui/ElementJavadoc.java#L742)).\r\n\r\n2. Otherwise, if the source contains no javadoc for the requested element or finding the requested code element in the source fails, try to use the javadoc.\r\n\r\n3. Otherwise, if the code element is a method, recurse upward the type hierarchy.\r\n\r\n4. Otherwise, display the \"Attach Javadoc...\" popup.\r\n\r\nI think the order is sensible, changing it would probably be too disruptive.\r\n\r\nI traced the execution after requesting javadoc for `stage.setScene(scene)` to [ElementHandle::resolveImpl](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.source.base/src/org/netbeans/api/java/source/ElementHandle.java#L177), where the method signature the user clicked on  (`{ \"javafx.stage.Stage\", \"setScene\", \"(Ljavafx/scene/Scene;)V\" }`) does not match the signature parsed from Stage.java (`{ \"javafx.stage.Stage\", \"setScene\", \"(LScene;)V\" }`). The reason the parameter from the JavaFX source is not fully qualified is because javac reports it as `TypeKind.ERROR`, see [ClassFileUtil](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.source.base/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/source/usages/ClassFileUtil.java#L277).\r\nIn fact, javac reports **every** reference type from Stage.java as `TypeKind.ERROR`, even types like `String` that are not part of the JavaFX source. I haven't checked yet, but I assume this is also the reason why source navigation fails (notice that only jumping to methods that take reference types fails, others work fine).\r\n\r\nAbout `stage.show()`: No reference type parameters, so it should work fine. It uses `{@inheritDoc}` though, and javac fails to resolve the superclass `Window` inside [ElementJavadoc::getInherited](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.sourceui/src/org/netbeans/api/java/source/ui/ElementJavadoc.java#L1078) (`type.getSuperclass().getKind()` returns `TypeKind.ERROR`). There is no other content in the javadoc of the method, so only the method signature is displayed.\r\n\r\nThat's where I stopped, the next step would probably be to see what's so special about Stage.java that javac can't parse its type references.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing\r\nThe javac errors are not caused by this PR: Renaming the source artifact in .m2 to `javafx-graphics-13-linux-sources.jar` (so NetBeans finds it) leads to the same failures in stock NetBeans 11.2: source navigation jumps to the top of the file and javadoc is only displayed for methods without reference type parameters. With this PR there is at least a fallback to javadoc jars when javac can't resolve type references.\r\n\r\nI did not check why the Ant project works, but fixing the javac errors has to be done anyway.\r\n\r\nWhile looking through the source I also found two other places that deal with javadoc that need to be adapted to javadoc 9+ output (namely [HTMLJavadocParser::parseClass](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.sourceui/src/org/netbeans/api/java/source/ui/HTMLJavadocParser.java#L281) and [JavadocHelper.TextStream](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.source.base/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/source/JavadocHelper.java#L274)). I'd like to consolidate the logic a bit, I think I have a way that doesn't break any public API. But leaving those places in for now shouldn't have a huge negative impact. I'm for merging this PR and I'll do a follow up PR when time permits.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/552133026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/552154271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1548#issuecomment-552154271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1548","id":552154271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjE1NDI3MQ==","user":{"login":"jgneff","id":1413266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff","html_url":"https://github.com/jgneff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgneff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-10T01:45:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T01:45:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the great research, Thomas.
