It's also possible to optimize for some values of batch sizes, such as power of 2, and then combine them to generate other batches. @yuruofeifei and I can start to look at this problem.

I agree with @FrozenGene and others  that good documentation is indeed important for graduation. Still I think that attracting developers is a different goal because developers will effectively do in-depth architecture review which may be not the case for Apache graduation officials. Good documentation could impress newcomers, but they leave shortly after their few coding attempts if they don't understand or don't like the design.  I agree with @Ravenwater that current documentation doesn't adequately describes architecture questions and I think that it is because some large-to-medium-scale question are still unanswered.\r\n\r\nFor example: it is still unclear to me what to think about tvm's C++ DSL. Should it be considered stable and integration-ready or not? API looks good, but C++ examples were recently removed from tutorials, but git log shows efforts towards rewriting Python in C++, but there are still lots of Python/C++ duplication in code..\r\n\r\nAlso I would name assertions in place of error messages, situation with simplifiers (this problem is not on a surface), situation with top-level reduce limitation which looks artificial, consistency of the politics regarding -1 in shapes and other corner-cases.\r\n\r\nThose problems don't have signs of immediate failure, but may have negative effect on newcomers.

I hope this is a satisfying answer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/457373027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/457379473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2503#issuecomment-457379473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2503","id":457379473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzM3OTQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:18:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T22:18:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some MXNet models use \"reverse\" to reshape tensors.

I have a question regarding the performance of auto diff, specifically about `DiffBuildingBlock`.\r\n\r\nTaking the final loss as a scalar value for example, suppose we have an input tensor of shape `(i1, i2, ..., i_m)`, an output tensor of shape `(j1, j2, ..., j_n)`, the adjoint of the output with shape `(j1, j2, ..., j_n)`, and the Jacobian of the output w.r.t. the input is `(j1, j2, ..., j_n, i1, i2, ..., i_m)`. In `DiffBuildingBlock`, it performs a tensor dot operation on the **head** and **Jacobian** to get the adjoint of the input. While this is a generic way of realizing auto diff, a tensor dot operation can actually be avoided for many operators whose forward algorithms are known and Jacobian is sparse.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have taken the situation like this into the following optimization passes. Just want ask\r\n\r\n1. If you have compared the performance of autodiff with the gradient kernels manually devised in MXNet/Pytorch/TF?\r\n2.

If you have compared the performance of autodiff with the gradient kernels manually devised in MXNet/Pytorch/TF?\r\n\r\nI haven't yet. The main problem of such a comparison is that we need to schedule the generated gradients somehow. So far I've only tried to compare the overall performance of a couple of simple neural networks with Keras/TF on CPU. I used a very naive scheduling method (just fuse axes, and then split the resulting axis to parallelize), so the forward pass was about 1.7x slower on tvm, and the backward pass was about 3x slower. So I would currently estimate the generated gradients to be about 2x \"worse\" than the manually written ones. However, this is very operation-dependent, so I should compare performance for separate operations in the future.\r\n\r\n> 2. Any guideline on when should users provide their own `fdiff` functions to `tvm.autodiff.differentiate`?\r\n\r\nI was thinking of two use cases:\r\n- When the autodiff does a poor job and we have to perform differentiation manually for certain tensors.\r\n- When the user wants to try a custom set or order of optimizations (different from the ones used in `DiffBuildingBlock`).\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no way to find out if the autodiff did a poor job, other than run and measure the performance, or look at the generated code, but I'm thinking about writing a simple analyzer which will issue a warning if the generated code looks bad.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458094555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458096918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2292#issuecomment-458096918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2292","id":458096918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODA5NjkxOA==","user":{"login":"nhynes","id":2353785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes","html_url":"https://github.com/nhynes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T11:36:48Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T11:36:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`common` crate still needs work.

Please review again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458253294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458255680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2510#issuecomment-458255680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2510","id":458255680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI1NTY4MA==","user":{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T18:54:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T18:54:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinx13 Does the conflict happen in argsort_ir?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458255680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458275005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2448#issuecomment-458275005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2448","id":458275005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI3NTAwNQ==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T19:48:02Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T19:48:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yzhliu it should be ready if the last issue with CI build resolves quickly and there's no other requested changes which seems there's none.\r\ncc: @nhynes ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458275005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458279331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2292#issuecomment-458279331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2292","id":458279331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI3OTMzMQ==","user":{"login":"nhynes","id":2353785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes","html_url":"https://github.com/nhynes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T20:00:26Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T20:00:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Yes and I fixed the test and example\r\n\r\nCool. I'm fixing the test, too. The build step is really flaky. I'm going to do that then rebase onto upstream/master. It'll help if you don't make pushes in the meantime :)\r\n\r\n> better to resolve new features later, otherwise it'll be never ending\r\n\r\nThese aren't new features; this is getting the code in a good place before it becomes a permanent part of the codebase. Don't worry, though. I understand your frustration. Please let me finish my pass over the codebase as a user of the library. Minimal work on your part.\r\n\r\nHere's my overall thinking: rewriting parts of TVM in Rust is a great opportunity to clean up accumulated C++ cruft. The Rust code that gets committed now will set the standard of the code that will continue to be written. You'll surely agree that it's worth taking the time to make the scaffolding robust.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458279331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/458279640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2353#issuecomment-458279640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2353","id":458279640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI3OTY0MA==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T20:01:15Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T23:06:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It turns out the issue comes from the way test cases generating numpy results.
