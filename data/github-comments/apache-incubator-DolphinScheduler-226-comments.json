Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nWhen I create a project with the administrator, and then manually set a normal user for the user to which the project belongs. At this time, go to the user management in the security center to check the assignment status. A display error will occur.\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nAfter I create a project, I manually set a common user for the user to which the project belongs, and the Security Center will synchronize the authorization status.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n1. Use admin to create a new project\r\n2. admin changes the user to ordinary user A\r\n3. The administrator goes to Security Center - User Management - Ordinary User A - Authorization Items\r\nAn exception was found for the authorization item. There are multiple identical items and it is not a real permission display.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing

The resource center on DS is currently stored on the same set of HDFS, and is pulled from HDFS when DS is executed.\r\nIf it is a multi-cluster, you need to consider how to design file storage.\r\n2. Currently ds supports kerberbos authentication. If kerberos authentication is enabled for multiple clusters, how does kerberos authenticate?\r\nEnable kerberbos mutual trust or use the same set of kerberbos authentication?\r\n3. The client/configuration files of multiple cluster environments are different, how to manage them. For example, hadoop and spark versions are configured differently.\r\n4. The general requirement to support multiple environments should be to push tasks from the development environment to the production environment. Is there a review and release process for this?\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n支持多环境这是一个好的需求.\r\n\r\n这是我想到的可能涉及的几个问题:\r\n\r\n1.DS上的资源中心目前是存储在同一套HDFS上, DS执行的时候从HDFS上拉取.\r\n如果是多集群的话,需要考虑一下文件存储方面如何设计.\r\n2.目前ds支持kerberbos认证, 如果是多个集群开启kerberos认证的话, kerberos如何认证?\r\n开启kerberbos互信还是使用同一套kerberbos认证?\r\n3.多个集群环境的客户端/配置文件不一样,如何管理. 比如hadoop,spark版本配置不同.\r\n4.支持多个环境的常规诉求应该是是开发环境任务推送到生产环境. 这个是否有审核发布流程?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1104665023/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1104665470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9597#issuecomment-1104665470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9597","id":1104665470,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5B19t-","user":{"login":"Amy0104","id":97265214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBcwmPg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97265214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104","html_url":"https://github.com/Amy0104","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Amy0104/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-21T03:20:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T03:20:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I'm not familiar with front-end, but I'd like to give a try. : )\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems, you can concat me or @songjianet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1104665470/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1104665908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9597#issuecomment-1104665908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/9597","id":1104665908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5B1900","user":{"login":"EricGao888","id":34905992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTA1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34905992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888","html_url":"https://github.com/EricGao888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-21T03:21:42Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T03:21:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > I'm not familiar with front-end, but I'd like to give a try. : )\r\n> \r\n> If you have any problems, you can concat me or @songjianet.\r\n\r\nCooooool!
