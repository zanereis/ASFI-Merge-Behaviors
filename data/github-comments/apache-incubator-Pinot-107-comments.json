The motivation for this draft is the ability to eventually support columns which contain typed entity-attribute-values for handling semi-structured data and the real blocker is that a `DataSource` _must_ have a single `DataType`, rather than determine it on the fly when dealing with semi-structured columns. Obviously, a typed EAV column isn't really in the spirit of Pinot's columnar architecture, and determining types row by row has a cost, but it opens up use cases with semi-structured data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/941097749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/941146912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7545#issuecomment-941146912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7545","id":941146912,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c44GMMg","user":{"login":"SandishKumarHN","id":3078999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN","html_url":"https://github.com/SandishKumarHN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SandishKumarHN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-12T15:57:45Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T15:57:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@elonazoulay looks like it doesn't hang for me. it throws a proper error message.  \r\n```\r\nselect cast(runs as long) as runs from baseballStats limit 10\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pinot.sql.parsers.SqlCompilationException: Alias runs cannot be referred in SELECT Clause\r\n\tat org.apache.pinot.sql.parsers.CalciteSqlParser.matchIdentifierInAliasMap(CalciteSqlParser.java:156)\r\n\tat org.apache.pinot.sql.parsers.CalciteSqlParser.matchIdentifierInAliasMap(CalciteSqlParser.java:148)\r\n\tat org.apache.pinot.sql.parsers.CalciteSqlParser.matchIdentifierInAliasMap(CalciteSqlParser.java:144)\r\n\tat org.apache.pinot.sql.parsers.CalciteSqlParser.validateSelectionClause(CalciteSqlParser.java:135))\r\n```\r\nplease correct me, if I'm missing anything here.

I am ok with pushing the changes but I would like to postpone the decision on query semantics. It's too early to make a call and it might be hard to change/reverse later. I like that you have made it configurable for now. Let's go with that and revisit the query semantics later. I have some thoughts but it's beyond the scope of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/941190546/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/941208184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7565#issuecomment-941208184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7565","id":941208184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c44GbJ4","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-12T17:13:17Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T17:13:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The concerns expressed here fundamentally relate to the way values of different types are combined when results from different segments are merged, and handling this gracefully is a prerequisite for semi-structured data - typed EAVs can't be made to work without it.

When the segment finishes reloading, A' is destroyed. A upsert table metadata manager needs to delete all the references to the old segment  in the upsert metadata table `_primaryKeyToRecordLocationMap`.  This step right now takes too long for finish and should be optimized. One interesting note is that during segment reload, in fact none of the segment location is changed logically and they can be left untouched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent |timestamp\r\n-- | --\r\nClosed
