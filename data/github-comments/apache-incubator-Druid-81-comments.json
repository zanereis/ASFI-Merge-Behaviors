I just tried an overlord update and hit it.  \nI think the race I hit was as follows - \n1) thread 1 and 2 both make a copy of pendingTasks \n2) thread 1 goes ahead and assigns the task, does putIfAbsent in tryAssignTasks, assigns the task and then finally remove the task from tryAssignTasks \n3) now thread 2 tries to assign the same task calls a tryAssignTasks.putIfAbsent which succeeds and it then tries to read the task payload which was earlier removed by thread 1.  \n\nFor the impact, i can confirm that the overlord was able to make progress and the task assignment also worked after this.

there a standard way in jetty to collect metrics ? \nIIRC jetty can also be configured to collect stats about requests and sessions, \nwondering if exploring that would give us more detailed info & metrics about the jetty requests.

OffheapIncrementalIndex is not available for indexing[yet], but only optionally used in GroupBy queries which tries to optimize things by not sorting results in IncrementalIndex when possible (see

results to end user and with sortFacts = FALSE off-heap performance is not that bad.\n\nthis impl of off-heap is different from previous one as it does not serde any strings and keeps dimension dictionary on-heap wherease old impl tried to put everything off-heap.\nnote that on-heap version can not be created without very large heaps but off-heap version (even if 3x slower with sortFacts being true) allows larger groupBy queries with ability to upper bound on off-heap size.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/211417550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/211418889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2842#issuecomment-211418889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2842","id":211418889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTQxODg4OQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-18T15:05:09Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T15:05:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hmmm,
