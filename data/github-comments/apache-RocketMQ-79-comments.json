We had this problem on a 4.6.0 production environment and I also reproduced this problem on 4.8.0. It seems to me this issue applies to code on master branch as well.\r\n\r\nWe lost quite a few data and spent days to recover due to this problem. The failure to start the broker w/ empty files under commit log directory surprised and confused us quite a lot. And we didn't see same problem on brokers in the same cluster and it WORKED previously. Then our admin created an empty commit log directory and made the broker use that. The broker started successfully at last. However, almost all our application topics were lost. It took us a few days to recover messy data caused by this accident. \r\n\r\nRocketMQ is quite reliable and it is definitely unlikely to corrupt the commit log by itself. \r\nAnd commit log file names are 20-digit w/ zero padding. There is no reason to make big fuss about irrelevant files, the 'the-bad-empty-file-fails-rocketmq-startup' in this case, and fails the startup. It makes perfect sense to igore files does not match the commit log name pattern and only fail on real commit log corruption.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/898884407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
