Thanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are:\r\n1) We tend to prefer method calls that don't use `get` in the name (or `set`). Either some other verb is used to be more informative (examples like `find`, etc) or we just don't use `get` since it likely provides little meaning if there isn't a more specific verb to use. That's probably why we have the two methods. So if we do remove one, it would be more in line with the project style to keep `.conf()` and remove `.getConf()`.\r\n2) This is a rather old API. My opinion is we can't necessarily be sure if people are depending on this API or not. I'm interested in hearing other people's opinions on this, but I think it might be safer to keep both and mark `getConf` (or at least one of them) as deprecated.\r\n\r\nPlease don't spend the time updating the PR to use `conf()` instead of `getConf()` unless somebody else chimes in though so you don't make unnecessary updates 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1011872346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1011878742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3879#issuecomment-1011878742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3879","id":1011878742,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX848UAtW","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T07:45:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T07:45:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kbendick  thanks for your comment, already got your gist.Let's wait for others' suggestions and then consider whether to make this change. 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1011878742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1011892072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3879#issuecomment-1011892072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3879","id":1011892072,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX848UD9o","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T08:07:18Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T08:07:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since it is `Hadoop`FileIo, I think it is \"natural\" to expect it to implement `org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configurable`.
