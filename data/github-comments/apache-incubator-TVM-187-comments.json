The original `MergeComposite` pass will recover bind parameters so the composite functions are guaranteed to have the same number of inputs as before. However, composite functions generated by `pattern.partition` still accesses the metadata for constant nodes. That's why the input number doesn't match.

For example, we may have\r\n\r\n```\r\n%0 = nn.conv2d(%data, meta[relay.Constant][0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we treat `nn.conv2d` as a Relay function, we can see that even one if its arguments is a constant, we still maintain its function signature and pass the constant node via the call. Since this concept is applicable to fused and composite functions, I think it would be better for pattern language to have the same behavior.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I would like to ask @tqchen @zhiics @yzhliu for double confirm :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/632996700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/633004751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5663#issuecomment-633004751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5663","id":633004751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzAwNDc1MQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-23T08:07:53Z","updated_at":"2020-05-23T08:07:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seems you've hit a flaky test, feel free to comment it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/633004751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/633012705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5664#issuecomment-633012705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5664","id":633012705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzAxMjcwNQ==","user":{"login":"roastduck","id":6522983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjI5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6522983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck","html_url":"https://github.com/roastduck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roastduck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-23T09:18:12Z","updated_at":"2020-05-23T09:18:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wait.
