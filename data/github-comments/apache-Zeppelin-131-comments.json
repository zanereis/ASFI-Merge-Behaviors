sorry for late answer! Not sure why I didn't get any notifications about your answers :confused: \r\n@zjffdu I haven't looked into who actually sends the signal, but if it is as you say, with the user owning the interpreter process sending the signal, it should be fine. \r\nMy worry was that it was sent by the user running the server, and that if that user isn't root (which would be a terrible idea for other reasons) the OS wouldn't allow sending signals to another users process.\r\nAnd it is tricky to set up impersonation, but as far as I know it is not broken. I only have my production environment with this set up right now. I suggest not using spark to test with. The `sudo` approach clashes with the spark impersonation, so if you really want to try that you have to set `export ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_SPARK_PROXY_USER=false`, and find a way to make sure the user starting the interpreter has a kerberos ticket (if you need that)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/283636372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/283658841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2074#issuecomment-283658841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2074","id":283658841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzY1ODg0MQ==","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T13:53:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T13:53:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@1ambda did you get time to review this ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/283658841/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/283664001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1545#issuecomment-283664001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1545","id":283664001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzY2NDAwMQ==","user":{"login":"Malian","id":553321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzMyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/553321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian","html_url":"https://github.com/Malian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Malian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T14:15:10Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T14:15:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zjffdu What's the status of this pull request ?
