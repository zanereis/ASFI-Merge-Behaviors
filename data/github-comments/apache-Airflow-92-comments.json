You need this kind of logic to guard against tasks that are not able to set themselves to a certain state, e.g. out of memory, sigkill, segfault etc (which are set by the os). Thus here you cannot count on what the state of the TaskInstance is.\r\n\r\nAs we are executing the tasks as subprocesses and cannot just rely on what the task reports as its state, we will need to rely on how the OS passes messages (errors in this case) between the processes it runs. \r\n\r\nIn backfills we are relying on the monitoring (already in 1.7.x) to verify that what the task is reporting as state in congruent with what the executor is thinking the task can report at all. The need for CONCURRENCY_REACHED/EBUSY is to make sure the executor and the task stay in sync. Otherwise the executor would report either success or failed which would not make sense in case of State.NONE (or any other state that does not signal SUCCESS or FAILED). I didn't add CONCURRENCY_REACHED to the task states as that would requiring the Scheduler code to handle that as well. I tried to keep the changes to a minimum.\r\n\r\nObviously I am open to a more simple approach, given the constraints of monitoring. I tried a couple of approaches (removing the TI from the tasks the executor knows when reporting about which was a hack and didn't work), but I ended up with tasks being marked failed incorrectly every single time.\r\n\r\n@aoen on your remark that the executor should reschedule tasks I don't think that is smart: it would need its own scheduling logic (backoffs, not scheduling etc). Seems to me as that would severely increase complexity. The executor is quite dumb right now, it just reports back (it already was!) what the OS reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/307509527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/307515775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2358#issuecomment-307515775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2358","id":307515775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzUxNTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-09T22:38:05Z","updated_at":"2017-06-11T20:41:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2358](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/8e23d28705e1f0d9c4ab76bb2318025bab3aef0a?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.03%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358/graphs/tree.svg?height=150&token=WdLKlKHOAU&src=pr&width=650)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #2358      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   69.47%   69.43%   -0.04%     \n==========================================\n  Files         145      145              \n  Lines       11070    11070              \n==========================================\n- Hits         7691     7687       -4     \n- Misses       3379     3383       +4\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `74.74% <0%> (-0.41%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2358?src=pr&el=footer).
