This would lead into two different approaches.\r\n\r\nA gRPC based proxy means providing a much simpler protocol than the current broker protocol. So it is easy to have different language gRPC clients. But it will has its own limitations and drawbacks, such as another network hop, and some of the features might be hard to support and etc.\r\n\r\nExposing pulsar broker protocol in gPRC can solve the problem in handling wire-level request & response encoding and decoding. However the challenge of implementing a Pulsar client is not about handling wire-level encoding and decoding. It is more about the logic within a Pulsar client, such as flow-control, topic lookup, error handling and etc. So we will still be facing the same challenges that current Pulsar client is facing. It is probably even worse than implementing language client wrapper using Pulsar c/c++ client, because implementing a language client wrapper is much simpler and less error prone than re-implementing flow-control, topic lookup and error handling in different languages.\r\n\r\nI would like to collect more requirements of gRPC to understand what is the right approach for solving the problem here.

I hear your concerns. Just to understand it more, if I understand correctly, Kafka doesn't provide an _official_ dotnet client in the apache repo. The dotnet client was maintained by confluent outside of the ASF. What is your thought about this? Is this model okay to you?\r\n\r\nThe model that Pulsar is using is very similar as Kafka. The Pulsar core repo maintains two core implementations, one is Java implementation and the other one is c++ implementation (with a c library exposed). So the community can develop other language wrappers based on the c/c++ library. In this way, Pulsar core team can focus on the core features and ensure it implemented correctly and reliably, and encourage more people in the community helping with developing different language clients (or wrappers). Although I guess people doesn't like implementing wrappers over a c/c++ library, people want *native* clients, which ends up with implementing the protocols in different languages (go, dotnet, rust and etc). If the requirement is to have a language-native client for every different language, it is really hard for Pulsar team to maintain and it also limits the scalability of the development. Thus we encourage developing language-native clients in the community. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of options we can probably explore on providing _official_ clients.\r\n\r\n1) implementing a dotnet wrapper over c/c++ library if it is a trivial enough to maintain.\r\n2) setting up a *pulsar-ecosystem* repo and move some of the community implementations to be under its umbrella. similar as what https://flink.apache.org/ecosystem.html and https://flink-packages.org/\r\n\r\nlet me know what you think.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559564195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559566128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/271#issuecomment-559566128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/271","id":559566128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTU2NjEyOA==","user":{"login":"cbornet","id":11633333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjMzMzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11633333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet","html_url":"https://github.com/cbornet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbornet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-28T17:19:33Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T17:20:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think moving to gRPC for the Pulsar clients would have some benefits.

thank you for your thorough reply, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nConfluent is an official enough a name when it comes to evaluating Kafka’s pros and cons. \r\n\r\nI can’t honestly comment on which scenario would work best, whether to follow Kafka’s model regarding project ownership.\r\n\r\nWhat I know, given my current understanding of Pulsar’s featureset, it’s that it is closer to my requirements than Kafka’s. However, the project’s site does not even mention .NET Core. This unfortunately can turn potential users away.\r\n\r\nI’m aware offering a proper client is no easy undertaking, especially considering the introduction of “memory friendly” constructs like Span in the latest .NET iterations, but it’s essential to increase adoption. My humble opinion, of course.\r\n\r\nThat being said, a gRPC endpoint + client package could be a viable solution, something to start with.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559612954/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559627897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5758#issuecomment-559627897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5758","id":559627897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTYyNzg5Nw==","user":{"login":"massakam","id":22543882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQzODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22543882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam","html_url":"https://github.com/massakam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massakam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T01:04:51Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T01:04:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559627897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559631006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5762#issuecomment-559631006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5762","id":559631006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTYzMTAwNg==","user":{"login":"Jennifer88huang-zz","id":47805623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODA1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47805623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jennifer88huang-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T01:31:04Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T01:31:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie Got it.

The situation you mentioned is my initial implementation plan. However, when I tested it, I found that different command objects `jcommand` was used in the PulsarAdminTool and CmdBase.\r\n\r\nPulsarAdminTool:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-tools/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/admin/cli/PulsarAdminTool.java#L87\r\nCmdBase:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-tools/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/admin/cli/CmdBase.java#L38\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the child commands were inherited from the class `CmdBase`. In subclasses such as `CmdTopics`, we cannot get the `commandMap` object. Therefore, it may be necessary to pass down the `commandmap` object and the `jcommand` object of `PulsarAdminTool`. therefore, it is necessary to add some logic to the `PulsarAdmintool`. I am not sure if my understanding is correct. I hope to get your reply, but I will try this implementation as much as possible.\r\n\r\n@sijie ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559637809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/559639959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5768#issuecomment-559639959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5768","id":559639959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTYzOTk1OQ==","user":{"login":"tuteng","id":1907867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDc4Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1907867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng","html_url":"https://github.com/tuteng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuteng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T02:35:57Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T02:35:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I saw a `broker-stats` sub-command under the command `pulsar-admin` and a `load-report` sub-command under the command `broker-stats`.
