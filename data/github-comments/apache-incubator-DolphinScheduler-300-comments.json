Add **taskServerInfo** (just contain ip, user, password, name) entity in dolphinscheduler-task-plugin model. And add taskServerInfo field in TaskExecutionContext.\r\n\r\nI think it's better not to use userName/passWord in ssh since there are some security risks. Using pam file or authrized_key in ssh is a more secure way.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have some different thoughts on the implementation method.\r\n\r\nCurrently, DS supports S3 and HDFS as the storage mode of the resource center. In the future, it may also support other object storage, such as alibaba cloud oss, tencent cloud cos, etc.\r\n\r\n1. In common usage scenarios, the masterServer/apiServer's node usually does not contain the permission to use HDFS and S3. These permissions are usually included in the workerServer's node. It requires these permissions on user's masterServer/apiServer's node if using scp command to trasfer the files to the task server. In addition, downloading files from the masterServer/apiServer's node and then scping them to the task node will waste network IO and hard disk IO for some large files or large number of small files.\r\n\r\n2. Using SSH to execute shell commands usually requires escaping a lot of special characters for different task type. And I think this is a huge workload for subsequent maintenance.\r\n\r\n3. Using SSH means that the task running status and running logs need to be monitored by the masterServer. This may lead to high load on masterServer's node when the number of tasks is quite large.\r\n\r\nWhich is not reasonable for users and maintainers.\r\n\r\nBased on all the above issues. I suggest implementing this in the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Create a task level callback in the masterServer to provide a single task with task monitoring information.\r\n\r\n2. Create an executable task for each task, which can be a jar package or an executable file compiled through golang or any other languages, and transfer it to the task node for execution through asynchronous ssh. This executable task contains the actual execution of the task and the monitoring information reported by the task to the master.\r\n\r\n3. After the task is finished, the masterServer deletes the task's executable file through ssh or any other ways for clean up.\r\n\r\nIn this way, all task types can be seamlessly implement with high performance and the task content can be executed without any escape. It also reduces the monitoring load of the master. Which is more reasonable for distributed processing and our maitainers and users.\r\n\r\nThese are my humble opinions. If you have any questions, please let me know. @DarkAssassinator

Define a Workflow and run it , then i got a Workflow Instance\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190185414-1e08269f-0196-46f7-937b-fa9a23d46844.png)\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190185644-e3236ae1-50e3-4bb9-9504-a4cf216b507e.png)\r\n\r\n2. Edit the Workflow Instance then saving it without selecting 'update definition' check-box . \r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190186198-a4ecdc2f-f23b-40f3-a363-3fa0b9b1a020.png)\r\n\r\n3. Return to the Workflow Definition UI , i got a error \r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190186425-94b87f35-2979-4d00-887f-a420d56d3bc6.png)\r\nand i found an NPE in the backend logs\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190187602-2b385326-5453-4e0d-8c13-2014b718215b.png)\r\nThe direct cause is **THE VAR `processDefinitionLog` IS NULL**\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190188133-f0a67785-7e4a-4b56-adb7-701917454b5a.png)\r\n\r\n4. i check records in the meta-database(mysql style) and find that records accidentally lost in table `t_ds_process_definition_log` \r\nThere should be two records, their `version` column values ​​are 1 and 2 respectively\r\n(直接原因是t_ds_process_definition_log表丢失了一条version列值为1的记录)\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190189561-d19c660e-264f-46a4-8077-366107406d0b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nNo exception occurred\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nThe steps are listed in the paragraph **What happened** above\n\n### Anything else\n\nI analysis the codes and i think the root is in method `org.apache.dolphinscheduler.service.process.ProcessServiceImpl#saveProcessDefine`: \r\nit query the `log obj` which according to the `ID` of the `definition obj` , then updating the `log obj` to set a new `version` .\r\nThe `t_ds_process_definition_log` table should keeps all records of definition's changes and the record should not be overwritten or updated, which may be against the design \r\n(根本原因是更新工作流实例时，根据工作流定义的ID查找了 `LOG 对象` 并修改了 `version值` , Log表应该保留所有定义变更的历史记录，不应该把version=1的记录更新掉。况且用定义对象的ID去查询更新LOG对象就不对。)\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49931055/190192100-3af59cb2-9c57-4d8a-9d19-41ee52c10649.png)\r\n\n\n###
