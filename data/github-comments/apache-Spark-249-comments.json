The main points are the following: I'm not sure what it means for an application to have an option of application ID. From the perspective of an application it should always have an ID. If this is an implementation detail (i.e. because certain cluster managers don't provide their own IDs), then it might make sense to use a default (e.g. `mesos-<app-name>-<timestamp>`).\n\nFrom your description I take it that you haven't had the chance to test this on Mesos. Given that I think it makes sense to hold back on adding this behavior there for now and instead file a JIRA for it. Also, now that #1094 is merged, I assume part of your changes in the YARN code needs to be reverted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50385569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50386062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1338#issuecomment-50386062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1338","id":50386062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzg2MDYy","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T19:24:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T19:24:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA

The other two don't really have an order - they just conflict with each other, so once one is in I'll need to fix the other.\n\nRegarding the \"app id\" question, I think the app ID is a cluster-specific concept. I think it's a little sketchy to let the framework create some ID when the cluster manager doesn't do it - and I'm especially wary of using timestamps for that. It's probably better to let the affected parties (e.g. the history server) decide what's the best approach when an application does not have a cluster-provided ID.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50417105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50417376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1498#issuecomment-50417376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1498","id":50417376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDE3Mzc2","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-28T23:42:15Z","updated_at":"2014-07-28T23:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok the tests seem to be running ok now speed wise (after #1604).
