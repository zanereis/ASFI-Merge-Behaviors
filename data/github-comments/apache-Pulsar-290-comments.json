I know, and I mentioned that in the commit message that we may end up leaving garbage behind which can be cleaned up manually later, as it is being logged as error log. \r\n\r\nI can be wrong but my theory is.\r\n\r\nDeletion of table in state store can take long time sometimes(We are trying to address that) but regardless of that deletion is a heavy operation and it may fail at multiple places. In that scenarios should we allow ingestion to fail or block because it could not delete a table? Or we leave the garbage behind and make progress.

If an error occurs, it is logged.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this change:\r\n\r\n1) Currently, all cleanup operations of external resources used by a Pulsar Function is best effort.  There is no guarantee a resource like subscription or table will be cleanup.  We make a best effort but there is no guarantee.  Thus, this change does not really change any guarantees from that perspective.  We will be looking into ways to improve that in the future.\r\n\r\n2) Since our current model is best effort, there is no need to wait for the table deletion operation to complete.  Even though this is not an issue for Pulsar Functions, the state store client has some issues that we are investigating with cause it to block indefinitely. Thus, another reason to not to wait and be blocked forever with making any progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/769960599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/769975337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9159#issuecomment-769975337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9159","id":769975337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTk3NTMzNw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T18:33:29Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T18:33:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I commented as much as I could and provided all the examples and code links from Apache Airflow :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/769975337/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/769976936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9159#issuecomment-769976936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9159","id":769976936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTk3NjkzNg==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T18:36:47Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T18:36:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I commented as much as I could and provided all the examples and code links from Apache Airflow :)\r\n\r\nThank you @potiuk .

Just to make sure I understand, would you want key 1 messages to be able to delivered to many consumers? But block on sending on sending any more messages until the latest key 1 message is processed? If Key 1, has many messages, this likely would be somewhat slow, as we can't pipeline messages and would need to have the broker doing lots of back and forth, but would let all other consumers continue with other keys. Is that what you are trying to solve?\r\n2. For your use case, how many keys do you expect to be dealing with across how many consumers?
