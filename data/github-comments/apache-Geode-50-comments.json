I have a question about the packages and modules of the classes. e.g. `RestoreRedundancyResultsImpl` is in package `org.apache.geode.management.internal.operation`. And it is in `geode-management` module. Its subclass `SerializableRestoreRedundancyResultsImpl` is in a different package `org.apache.geode.internal.cache.control` and a different module `geode-core`. Why these two classes are in different packages and different modules?\r\n> Also some classes have been moved to a different package. e.g. `RegionRedundancyStatus` and `RestoreRedundancyResults`. Is there a reason for that?\r\n\r\nRestoreRedundancyResults is an interface and is external api, RestoreRedundancyResultsImpl is a direct implementation of it. These two are in the geode-management module because cms needs them to convey result data back to the client. \"SerializableRestoreRedundancyResultsImpl\", however, is needed to convey function call results from locator to servers, it needs to support rolling upgrade, so it needs to implement \"FixedDataSerializableID\" interface, that's why we have to have it extends RestoreRedundancyResultsImpl and implement the additional interfaces in geode-core.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/646304378/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/646339798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5139#issuecomment-646339798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5139","id":646339798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjMzOTc5OA==","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T22:38:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T22:38:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jvarenina

Now in this pull request, quite a few classes used to be subclasses of `SingleGfshCommand` now become the subclasses of `GfshCommand`. Does it mean that these classes don't update cluster config any more?\r\n\r\nThey don't update cluster config at all. They don't need to extends SingleGfshCommand in the first place and they didn't even implement the `updateGroupConfig` method at all.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> By default, the subclasses of `GfshCommand` returns `false` for `affectsClusterConfiguration`. But some class, e.g. `AlterRuntimeConfigCommand` that extends `GfshCommand` returns `true` for `affectsClusterConfiguration`. Why is that?\r\n\r\nBecause AlterRuntimConfigComand does affect cluster configuration. It updates the properties part of the cluster configuration.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/649039263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/649068114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5270#issuecomment-649068114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5270","id":649068114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTA2ODExNA==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T20:58:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T20:58:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 9 alerts** and **fixes 2** when merging 9026687ad01521bfaec235b2ad9774ff65c0d568 into 210dc4fe9b1657d8d7cb5c197c6b0153389be3ea -

Should we advise that they upgrade to 1.12.1 to get this fix before attempting to upgrade to 1.13.0?\r\n\r\nThis fix will be ported to `support/1.13` next. So 1.12.x users will be able to upgrade to the soon-to-be-released 1.13.0 version directly.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> What about upgrades from 1.11.0 to 1.12.0 or 1.11.0 to 1.12.1?\r\n\r\nThe bug exists in the 1.12 line before this PR. I think this PR will go into a 1.12.1 or 1.12.2? \r\n\r\nIf that's right, then a 1.11.0 to 1.12.0 upgrade will see the bug, and a 1.11.0 to 1.12.1 (or whatever release this PR goes into) will not see the bug.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I don't really know what versions of 1.12 actually exist after 1.12.0.

On the other hand, I think I have heard that it has been done at least once.\r\n\r\nIf you upgrade from one patch version to another patch version in the same line and `Version.CURRENT` doesn't change then you won't see this bug.\r\n\r\nIf you upgrade from one patch version to another patch version in the same line and `Version.CURRENT` _does_ change then you _will_ see this bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/652678946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/652679430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5334#issuecomment-652679430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5334","id":652679430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MjY3OTQzMA==","user":{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-01T22:35:34Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T22:35:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I don't think InternalDistributedMember should be changed in order to make this new unit test pass.
