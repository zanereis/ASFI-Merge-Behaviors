 Thanks for the patch. Few observations here \n1) you are changing interfaces to pass a codeDir param. I can't find it where codeDir used to fixed this issue. Whenever you are changing apis like this you should introduce a new method definition not change the existing ones as these are storm-core apis.  Please also explain whats the necessity of codeDir.\n2) you added dependency-reduced-pom.xml and any reason to remove org.clojars.runa from pom.xml. Also maven-eclipse.xml shouldn't be part of this commit.\nI am -1 on the current approach, changing apis to solve this is not a good idea. This pretty much breaks current topologies.\nI suggest you to look into ui/core.clj , one approach is to have a search functionality in logviewer  and provide a link next to error message with param to logviewer as the errormessage. When user clicks on that it goes to logviewer and highlight the error in the log file.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/70574408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/70575248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/365#issuecomment-70575248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/365","id":70575248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTc1MjQ4","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-19T22:50:54Z","updated_at":"2015-01-19T22:50:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@harshach @revans2 @ptgoetz \nI'd like to hear your thoughts about this.\nAnything including code reviews, thought about Storm + Redis, and so on is very appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/70575248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/70576802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/359#issuecomment-70576802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/359","id":70576802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTc2ODAy","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-19T23:04:37Z","updated_at":"2015-01-19T23:04:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@d2r looks like this PR already merged into master but somehow PR didn't get closed.

You have a trident state and query function but in the core implementation you just provide an abstract bolt. Any reason why the core functionality can not be extended to support the basic persist and lookup features out of the box? You already have a mapper interface for trident and instead of taking the tridentuple as input you could change the type to ITuple so it will be able to support both trident states and core bolt. It is ok to leave this implementation as is and file a jira to add the core persist and lookup bolts later or document why it is not a good idea to do so.\n\nAlso I think the README should be more detailed. you probably want to document that users trying to use core features needs to extend AbstractRedisBolt and how they should be using methods from the parent class. The trident section should cover the query functions and your probably want to remove ShardedRedis related classes from README as they don't exist.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/70752983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/70753999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/388#issuecomment-70753999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/388","id":70753999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzUzOTk5","user":{"login":"d2r","id":905298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r","html_url":"https://github.com/d2r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-20T23:11:07Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T23:11:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I agree it is definitely a great idea to put the link on the UI, and this is what #150 did when it added `errorWorkerLogLink` to storm.\n\nBut I am not sure it adds anything to create a second link nearby to the same place.

\n\nI don't think we ever explained it in the docs.  I believe it was more of a discussion on the mailing lists when the kafka integration code was brought in.

We just have to be careful about checking if a serialized java class has changed from one release to another.  I personally would rather use Thrift over JSON.  JSON is great in many cases, but this data does not need to be human readable and thrift provides a known set of guidelines to ensure both forwards and backwards compatibility, including default values that JSON does not.  In addition thrift is what Trident uses for storing transactional state already, and would allow us to transition some of the data out of ZK and into a heartbeat server where thrift could handle the RPC as well.   </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/71040715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/122#issuecomment-71040715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/122","id":71040715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMDQwNzE1","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-22T15:45:55Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T15:45:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vkaggalumn  I don't think we tested that part of dev cycle.
