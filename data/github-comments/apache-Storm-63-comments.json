As Bobby suggested, would you mind if we decouple the work on max-retries (tracked at <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-677\" title=\"Maximum retries strategy may cause data loss\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-677\"><del>STORM-677</del></a>) from this pull request / <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329\" title=\"Fix cascading Storm failure by improving reconnection strategy and buffering messages\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-329\"><del>STORM-329</del></a>?  The max-retries issue has been a problem in Storm for a while, since before this pull request.  Decoupling would also help us with backtracking any future issues to either ticket.

The issue here is we are using Hadoop Authentication filter for SPNEGO. This filter has a default value 10hours for the cookie which sets the \"token.validity\" .So if a user authenticated and grabbed the ticket its valid for 10hrs. Changing kinit from command line doesn't affect this. <br/>\nYou can add \"token.validity\" : \"4\"  this sets token validity to 4 seconds and you can see the change in the UI as switch between users as you change login with kinit. In general this is not a regular practice as users log in with one single principal. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the example config<br/>\nui.filter.params:<br/>\n   \"type\": \"kerberos\"<br/>\n

Connections not needed any longer are closed, and new connections are created.  If a worker receives any tuples that are not for it, they are discarded and an error message is logged.  If a connection is to the wrong worker, in my experience, it has always been because workers were reassigned and the remote supervisor launched new workers faster then the current worker could update the routing.  This is also why it is important that the send method in the client not bock, because of the way locking is handled in storm if it does block, it can block the routing/connections from being updated and incorrect connections can persist longer than the typical 10 second maximum.</p>\n\n<p>Also secure versions of storm optionally use SASL when creating connections, so any connection to a worker of a different topology will never be established in the first place.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612527037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612527146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4519#issuecomment-2612527146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4519","id":2612527146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MjcxNDY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-19T17:54:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:25:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=manishnema\">manishnema</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=harsha_ch\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"harsha_ch\">sriharsha chintalapani</a> Thanks, this seems to be working as expected, </p>\n\n<p>This might be required as one can dedicate few nodes as edge/gateway node where users can login and submit/view their job in secured cluster.</p>\n\n<p>This change requires change in jinja scripts comes with Ambari </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612527146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/75109471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/318#issuecomment-75109471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/318","id":75109471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTA5NDcx","user":{"login":"NareshKosgi","id":2354168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi","html_url":"https://github.com/NareshKosgi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NareshKosgi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-19T18:37:44Z","updated_at":"2015-02-19T18:37:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 @Parth-Brahmbhatt I was able to build and run by using mvn install.

Xin,\n\nThank you for the good finding and patch.\n\nI have applied proposed patch on pure storm-0.9.3 branch, deployed and testet, and indeed it seems to fix the issue by skipping failed offsets. \nBut, in case there are lots of failed messages that have outdated offset -> the spout will slowly ask kafka for each of them and then discarding filed message one at a time.\n\nIn logs this will look like following: (some log warnings records were added for debugging reasons).\nNote, that \"new offset\" doesn't change.\n\n```\n2015-02-23T14:19:30.080+0100 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch

with offset out of range: [58094411837]\n```\n\nSo, I have added some logic to skip all the outdated failed offsets in one step, see code snippet below:\n\n```\n            //fix bug [STORM-643] : remove this offset from failed list when it is OutOfRange\n            if (had_failed) {\n                // For the case of EarliestTime it would be better to discard\n                // all the failed offsets, that are earlier than actual EarliestTime\n                // offset, since they are anyway not there.\n                // These calls to broker API will be then saved.\n\n                // In case of LatestTime - it is a question, if we still need to try out and\n                // reach those that are failed (they still may be available).\n                // But, by moving to LatestTime we are discarding messages in kafka queue.\n                // Since it is configured so, assume that it is ok for user to loose information\n                // and user cares about newest messages first.\n                // It makes sense not to do exceptions for those that are failed and discard them as well.\n\n                SortedSet<Long> omitted = failed.headSet(_emittedToOffset);\n\n                // Use tail, since sortedSet maintains its elements in ascending order\n                // Using tailSet will set a 'range' on original implementation\n                // so we couldn't then add objects that are out of range.\n                // For that reason we copy tail into new Set, where range is not set.\n                failed = new TreeSet<Long>(failed.tailSet(_emittedToOffset));\n                LOG.warn(\"Removing the failed offsets that are out of range: {}\", omitted);\n            }\n```\n\nSo, then outdated offsets are skipped at once, and we save several (hundreds) calls to kafka API:\n\n```\n2015-02-23T15:07:21.913+0100 s.k.KafkaUtils [WARN] Got fetch request with offset out of range:

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-643\" title=\"KafkaUtils repeatedly fetches messages whose offset is out of range\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-643\"><del>STORM-643</del></a> : remove this offset from failed list when it is OutOfRange<br/>\nif (had_failed) {<br/>\n    // For the case of EarliestTime it would be better to discard<br/>\n    // all the failed offsets, that are earlier than actual EarliestTime<br/>\n    // offset, since they are anyway not there.<br/>\n    // These calls to broker API will be then saved.</p>\n\n<p>    // In case of LatestTime - it is a question, if we still need to try out and<br/>\n    // reach those that are failed (they still may be available).<br/>\n    // But, by moving to LatestTime we are discarding messages in kafka queue.<br/>\n    // Since it is configured so, assume that it is ok for user to loose information<br/>\n    // and user cares about newest messages first.<br/>\n    // It makes sense not to do exceptions for those that are failed and discard them as well.</p>\n\n<p>    SortedSet<Long> omitted = failed.headSet(_emittedToOffset);</p>\n\n<p>    // Use tail, since sortedSet maintains its elements in ascending order<br/>\n    // Using tailSet will set a 'range' on original implementation<br/>\n    // so we couldn't then add objects that are out of range.<br/>\n    // For that reason we copy tail into new Set, where range is not set.<br/>\n    failed = new TreeSet<Long>(failed.tailSet(_emittedToOffset));<br/>\n    LOG.warn(\"Removing the failed offsets that are out of range: {}\", omitted);<br/>\n}<br/>\n    ```</p>\n\n<p>    So, then outdated offsets are skipped at once, and we save several (hundreds) calls to kafka API:</p>\n\n<p>
