everything should work if you use PyHive 0.6.2, I had to use the following configuration in Superset:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSQLAlchemyURL:

with what you have configured in Presto.\r\n* The above config is related to using Presto with TLS self signed certificates.\r\n*  KerberosKeytabPath is the path of the superset keytab on the Superset host\r\n* KerberosPrincipal is the principal of superset\r\n* If you want to use \"Impersonate the logged on user\" then you'll need to make the superset user in hadoop-site.xml as proxy.\r\n\r\nHope

@villebro So, I see we already have the **RowLevelSecurityTests** case and the **test_rls_filter_alters_query** test should catch the scenario with wrong **id** used imo. Or should we consider adding a new test? \r\n\r\nWe can make the case more general. I've altered a bit the test case in the **setUp** function, so it now adds 1 filter for 2 roles (2 role_filter relations in the **rls_filter_roles** table). And I also changed the **test_rls_filter_alters_query** test, so the user is now 'alpha' (role_id = 3), not 'gamma' (role_id = 4). This way the relation_id will not accidentally match the rls_filter_id.\r\nThe **rls_filter_roles** table at this point looks like:\r\n```\r\nid | role_id | rls_filter_id\r\n 1 |       4 |             1\r\n 2 |       3 |             1\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS. I also changed the clause to \"gender = 'boy'\" for consistency with the birth_names table (it only has 'boy' and 'girl' values in this column). It's not necessary, but to avoid confusion it will be useful I guess.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/606166493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
