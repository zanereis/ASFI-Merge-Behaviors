Because the shardingRule are different for each user.\r\nThe design can only call one time database sharding algorithm and table sharding algorithm. And users can think about and configure database sharding algorithm and table sharding algorithm independent. Especially in different database and table sharding column.\r\n\r\nIn your article, I see a base solution, but this solution only can solve the situation that sharding columns are same one and the numbers of database and table are equals. I think it is very customized. Do you have a more complete solution?\r\n\r\nWe can discuss in this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/552697598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/552702352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3500#issuecomment-552702352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3500","id":552702352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjcwMjM1Mg==","user":{"login":"KomachiSion","id":37170243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTcwMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37170243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion","html_url":"https://github.com/KomachiSion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KomachiSion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T02:13:26Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T02:13:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Do you use 4.0.0-RC2 release version?\r\n\r\nI think the problem is reference #2613 .

Because the shardingRule are different for each user.\r\n> The design can only call one time database sharding algorithm and table sharding algorithm. And users can think about and configure database sharding algorithm and table sharding algorithm independent. Especially in different database and table sharding column.\r\n> \r\n> In your article, I see a base solution, but this solution only can solve the situation that sharding columns are same one and the numbers of database and table are equals. I think it is very customized. Do you have a more complete solution?\r\n> \r\n> We can discuss in this issue.\r\n\r\nFirst, I do assume that there are the same number of tables in each database. I refer to the official configuration example and think it is consistent with the official one.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50389867/68646398-07898200-0556-11ea-9376-7b91e6f3b12c.png)\r\n\r\nAlthough the actual name of the table in my database is different. For example: ds0:user0,user1. ds1:user2,user3. Although loading the configured data node is inconsistent with the actual situation, it does not affect the correctness of my data routing. Because through my custom database and table algorithm I will not route to a nonexistent node. For example: ds0:user2,user3, but according to the existing official logic these errors will occur.\r\n\r\nAccording to my understanding, whether the key of database and database table is the same or not is only related to the specific table and database sorting algorithm, so it will not affect my routing logic.\r\n\r\nAccording to my understanding, the most likely problem between the official configuration and me is that if multiple data are configured, but only part of a table is designed, it needs to be configured in order.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50389867/68646797-1f153a80-0557-11ea-897a-2c401493c08a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50389867/68646833-3bb17280-0557-11ea-8e84-fa860d98fbae.png)\r\ndatabases configuration order needs to be adjusted on its own.or combine by multiple $->{ expression }.\r\n\r\nWelcome to point out

First, I do assume that there are the same number of tables in each database.
