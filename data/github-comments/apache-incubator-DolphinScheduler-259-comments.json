> Hi @EricGao888 , what kind of dynamic metrics do we have? You know, to fully use these metrics we need to display them and configure in Grafana, if we don't know these metrics in advance, how to configure these and use these metrics? Can you give some examples that we need dynamic metrics?\r\n> \r\n> @kezhenxu94 Thanks for the reply!\r\n> \r\n> Considering the following scenario: some user A works for a big financial company, and A chooses to use DS to schedule ETL tasks. Some of these tasks are not that important, but some are crucial, which may strongly relate to their financial business. Therefore, A wants some metrics to monitor these specific VIP tasks to avoid breaching SLAs for their customers. For example, task running duration, retry times, failover times, etc.\r\n> \r\n> To easily configure these dynamic metrics, we could name them as ds.dynamic.task.<task_id>.duration. Since A does not need to monitor dynamic metrics for every tasks, just the VIP ones, he could configure those metrics in grafana manually.\r\n> \r\n> But indeed, there is a concern that how users could get the task_id / workflow_id.\r\n\r\nTypo here, shouldn't use <task_id>s in metrics names but put them in tags as described in `Description` section and comment

And when `processCodeTaskNameCodeEntry.getValue()` is null ,it should be return `0L`. I can't figure how to happened. My branch‘s version is 2.0.5-release and I have checked the code is same with above from the compiled jar . Could you have a look at here, please. @JinyLeeChina\r\n> \r\n> I found the reason! Firstly, the NPE cause by `long` can't be null. Maybe it should replaced by `Long`. When the task A was depended by a sub process 's task B, task A rename to A1, or be deleted. And the task B 's depend item list wouldn't update, then cause the result that can't find the `depTasks`. It would be ok with fix the dependent task by manual.\r\n\r\nhow to fix the dependent task by manual?

I hope this problem can be solved.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\neg:\r\nThere are A and B subdirectories under the [Resource Center] root directory of the dolphinScheduler module.\r\nWhen using the tabA page to open the A directory, click the Create File button, fill in the a-1 file information, and do not save it for now.\r\nSwitch the tabB page to open the B directory, click the Create File button, fill in the b-1 file information, and click Save. At this time, the b-1 file information is normal.\r\nGo back to the tabA page and click Save. At this time, the fullName of the a-1 file saves the path of the B directory, which causes the subsequent resources in [Project Management] - Workflow to be abnormal.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No

If you could bring such feature into DS, it will be fantastic. Instead of understanding the running process of airflow, I suggest spending some time on the syntax of airflow DAG. Actually, we may not need to really run such DAGs generated from workflows. The main purpose is to help users review / give suggestions on the changes and python DAGs are easier to review than graphs.
