It's like having separate controls for the inlet and outlet sizes of a pipeline – they can be adjusted individually rather than being the same for both. It's also analogous to a consumer queue, where TimerDequeuePutMessageService puts data into the queue, and TimerDequeuePutMessageService retrieves data from it. The producer and consumer don't necessarily need to match; adjustments can be made according to the actual situation. This approach offers more flexibility. Of course, there's no issue with the current approach of having both quantities be the same.
