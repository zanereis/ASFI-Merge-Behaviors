Its name gives the idea of something that manages alerts and not clusters parameters/configurations. \n\nTo add that property, I was thinking about the “com.cloud.resource.ResourceManagerImpl.discoverCluster(AddClusterCmd)” method (lines 491 and 492 are already doing that for over-commitment factors), and then you could create a static entry at “CapacityManager” that seems to be the best option to hold such configurations.\n\nIf you change the “discoverCluster”, you would still need a script to add that parameter to those clusters that the environment already has. You have to do that to enable the users to change those parameters and use that functionality through the web interface.\n\nWhat do you

I don't think it is acceptable that we break support for `openjdk` and so dramatically reduce the supported environments.  If this goes in as it is, we will break a large percentage of people's environments as well as potentially breaking production environments that use `ooenjdk`.  If we really are going to remove support for `openjdk`, then that needs to be communicated to the community and planned in advance, we can't just make that switch.  We should probably start a thread in dev@ to discuss changing the environment requirements and plan how/when that change happens. This is not something we can just drop on people without proper documentation and an upgrade strategy. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/204714215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/204764789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1449#issuecomment-204764789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1449","id":204764789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDc2NDc4OQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-02T17:43:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T17:43:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@swill In the logs I see this:\n\n```\n{returns: [u'--2016-04-01 21:41:30--  http://www.google.com/', u'Resolving www.google.com... 2607:f8b0:4006:807::2004, 172.217.0.36', u'Connecting to www.google.com|2607:f8b0:4006:807::2004|:80... failed: Network is unreachable.', u'Connecting to www.google.com|172.217.0.36|:80... connected.', u'HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found', u'Location: http://www.google.ca/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=Cuv-Vo3NLuih8wfM-b6oAw [following]', u'--2016-04-01 21:41:30--  http://www.google.ca/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=Cuv-Vo3NLuih8wfM-b6oAw', u'Resolving www.google.ca... failed: Connection timed out.', u\"wget: unable to resolve host address 'www.google.ca'\"]}\nroot: DEBUG: Result from SSH into the Virtual Machine: [u'--2016-04-01 21:41:30--  http://www.google.com/', u'Resolving www.google.com... 2607:f8b0:4006:807::2004, 172.217.0.36', u'Connecting to www.google.com|2607:f8b0:4006:807::2004|:80... failed: Network is unreachable.', u'Connecting to www.google.com|172.217.0.36|:80... connected.', u'HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found', u'Location: http://www.google.ca/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=Cuv-Vo3NLuih8wfM-b6oAw [following]', u'--2016-04-01 21:41:30--  http://www.google.ca/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=Cuv-Vo3NLuih8wfM-b6oAw', u'Resolving www.google.ca... failed: Connection timed out.', u\"wget: unable to resolve host address 'www.google.ca'\"]\n```\n\nIt resolved `google.com` but then gets redirected to `www.google.ca` which it cannot resolve due to a timeout. Looks like a local issue, indeed. In a newer version of the test we are testing the public gateway instead but that hasn't been merged / sent as PR I guess.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/204764789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/204985068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1449#issuecomment-204985068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1449","id":204985068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDk4NTA2OA==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-03T14:25:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-03T14:25:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kollyma Can you squash the commits for me and I will then merge this in.

I shared what worked for me, I'm not saying you have to use oracle-java. The openjdk version 1.7.0_85+ causes test failures for building console proxy in my Linux environment while the same happens on OSX when using 1.7.0_90+, while openjdk version 1.7.0_80 works alright. The issue has to do with a set of cipher suites that got disabled, and we've also seen random javac seg faults. Both of them are related to `javac` and not `java`, and they are not consistent across platforms. In production we support openjdk-jre and not the `jdk/javac`, and I'm not trying to suggest we remove any sort of java7 jre support at all.\n\ntl;dr -- as I suggested earlier, what you're facing is an environment issue. It it helps, I'll try to split the PR into three -- one for mvn versions, one for bounty castle and changes by Daan, and one that fixes Travis.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/205149639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/205154145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1397#issuecomment-205154145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1397","id":205154145,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTE1NDE0NQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T06:27:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T06:27:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DaanHoogland do you want to have a look, if you can help fix the issue of building against latest openjdk and advise if bountycastle related changes are causing this.

@ustcweizhou Sorry to arrive late to the party but this appears to break/ignore some RvR functionality. 4 things in particular stand out:\n1. All public interfaces should be down in both redundanant virtual routers. Non-public interfaces should be up. The master.py script will bring up public interfaces on master routers. I had been discussing this with @ustcweizhou on the Cloudstack mailing list, Wei had provided a solution based upon the check_is_up method of the CsIP class (in CsAddress.py) but the commit at 8bbea5eeb6598b213b78a324c184841dbba69280 in #1413 appears to contradict what we discussed.\n2. Redundant virtual routers can have multiple public interfaces. Presumably, so can VPC routers - although I've not experimented with that. The source-NAT IP will be assigned to eth2 - as will any public IP on the same subnet. Public IPs on different subnets will be assigned to eth3, eth4, eth5 etc. with a new device being created for each separate subnet. The commit 11e61f7054234e17343e9a11948f1804d732ac6c in #1413 does not account for this.\n3. Because of point 2, we know that a new interface will be created on an RvR when an IP on a new subnet is assigned to it. Because of point 1, we know that that interface will be down because the master.py script will not have run since it was created. Currently a failover must be induced before this interface will be brought up - I'm yet to address this issue because of point 4, next.\n4. Currently static-NATs do not work on RvR setup when they are on a different subnet to the source-NAT IP. There are two reasons for this; one is missing iptables config allowing traffic across interfaces other than eth2. The second reason is that connmarks are being assigned to outbound traffic from eth0 (guest network) which are being used to match traffic to an interface in the IP rules. Traffic intended for a public network therefore gets routed out of the default gateway interface (eth2), breaking any static-NAT traffic on public IPs not assigned to eth2.\n\nI'd like to contribute to points 3 and 4 but issue #1413 appears to have been marked as closed. To remedy these points I might need to overwrite code committed as part of this issue, so it seems best to start a conversation about it before rolling the sleeves up and getting stuck in.\n\nAre these issues being considered else where?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/205716220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/205755506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1397#issuecomment-205755506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1397","id":205755506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTc1NTUwNg==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-05T10:57:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-05T10:57:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhaisaab I'm kind of confused, you write about three parts but I count four.
