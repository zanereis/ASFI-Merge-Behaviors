Using symlink like `local-spark/master` would be safe i think. It enables users replace their own local spark without renaming directories.

Now users need to type `get-spark`. it works as described \r\n\r\n```\r\n$  zeppelin-review git:(pr/1339) ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\r\nLog dir doesn't exist, create

\r\nThank you for your review a lot.\r\n\r\nFirst, the select box's interpreter shows only the first interpreter, because it is information about the default interpreter's settings.\r\nIn fact, the meaning of this information is that it makes sense to find an `uninterpreted note '.\r\n\r\nyour said pointed all the interpreters, I will implement on this pr later.\r\n\r\nThe navigation bar of the existing navbar and the search menu of the `job task` menu have different meanings.\r\n\r\nactually, navbar's search box is a good way to view detailed information about all the para-graphs.\r\n\r\nbut, I think we need search feature on `job menu(task)` are real-time response task monitoring.\r\nthe search for the `job task` should now filter the real-time information.\r\n\r\nFor example, if multiple users create and run a new paragraph or note, the search results of the `job task` should be changed to match the current situation.\r\nThe search using lucene is the information at the time the search query was requested.\r\nIt is detailed but not suitable for `job monitoring`.\r\n\r\nI also think that the information on the `job task` can contain more information about the current work situation.\r\nI have made a little more preparation for this part. (also your said point too)\r\nThat's why I think the search for the current navbar's search box and the `job task` should go to a different implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/263498070/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/263498350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1441#issuecomment-263498350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1441","id":263498350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzQ5ODM1MA==","user":{"login":"cloverhearts","id":10525473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts","html_url":"https://github.com/cloverhearts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-29T07:39:42Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T07:39:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"change name for item on select box.\r\nUndefined to Interpreter is not set","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/263498350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/263499076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1696#issuecomment-263499076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1696","id":263499076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzQ5OTA3Ng==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-29T07:44:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T07:44:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Spark 2.0 profile fails with very stragne\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-checkstyle-plugin:2.17:check (checkstyle-fail-build) on project zeppelin: Failed during checkstyle execution: Failed during checkstyle configuration: unable to parse configuration stream -
