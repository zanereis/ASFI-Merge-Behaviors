Calculate the current load of each worker.\r\n2. Find the minimum load worker and dispatch task. \r\nSo we just need to add the worker's waiting task in heartbeat, and when master calculate the load it should consider the worker's waiting task is enough for this issue. \r\n\r\nAdd worker reject command is another improvement, it's ok to me, it can protect the worker, but I think we don't need to cache the reject task, just consider it as

Any\r\nJDK Version : 8\r\nRun `mvn test -e ` in the terminal or press the button in IDEA\n\n### Anything else\n\nI wrote a demo to show how to reproduce it easily without waiting a long time for mvn test to run. I will analyze why this problem occurs and submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.dolphinscheduler.common.utils.JSONUtils;\r\nimport org.apache.dolphinscheduler.common.utils.JSONUtilsTest;\r\nimport java.util.TimeZone;\r\npublic class TimeZoneTest {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"UTC\"));\r\n        JSONUtils.createArrayNode();// This step is to load class and initialize JSONUtils's static code block\r\n        new JSONUtilsTest().stringToDate();\r\n        new JSONUtilsTest().dateToString();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50058173/170871560-220da39a-6332-48bf-826a-0251ebf0e616.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50058173/170871585-f381b568-a0a1-4fde-b344-af5fa69d9ede.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50058173/170872251-592d43cd-8448-4abb-8d85-783b3578831c.png)\r\n\r\nThe above one gives my demo and some source code screenshots. The reason for the bug is among them: \r\n\r\n- when using junit to execute use cases, each use case is isolated, and the JSONUtils class will not be shared among multiple use cases. In this case, `TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"Asia/Shanghai\")) `will not fail.Because the JSONUtils class is reinitialized once per use case\r\n\r\n- In the case of using` mvn test`, which is described in my demo, when the default time zone of the `TimeZone `class is set in other places through `TimeZone.setDefault`, the initialization of `JSONUtils` is carried out. At this time, `JSONUtils` final and static descriptors are modified parts The default time zone information in `TimeZone `will be loaded, and setting the `TimeZone `time zone via `TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"Asia/Shanghai\"))` in the future will not have any effect on JSONUtils.\r\n\r\n上面个给出了我的demo和部分源码截图，bug出现的原因就在其中：\r\n- 当使用junit执行用例时，每个用例都是隔离的，此时多个用例之间不会共享JSONUtils类，这种情况下就不会出现TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"Asia/Shanghai\"))失效。因为每个用例都会重新初始化一次JSONUtils类\r\n- 而在使用mvn test的情况中，也就是我demo中描述的那样，当在其他地方通过TimeZone.setDefault设置过TimeZone类默认时区后再进行JSONUtils的初始化，此时JSONUtils final 和static描述符修饰的部分就会加载TimeZone中默认的时区信息，而在以后再通过TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"Asia/Shanghai\"))设置TimeZone时区并不会对JSONUtils产生任何影响。\n\n### Version\n\ndev\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n-
