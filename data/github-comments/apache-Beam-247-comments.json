I'll file a separate JIRA to look into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/323990842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/323998940","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3738#issuecomment-323998940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3738","id":323998940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzk5ODk0MA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-22T11:31:02Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T11:31:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

In return, you'll get:\r\n\r\n- The ability to unit-test `SpannerAccessor` without a pipeline or a `DoFnTester`\r\n- The ability to have multiple `SpannerAccessor`'s in a single `DoFn` (say, you want to do something like `DynamicDestinations` but for Spanner)\r\n- The ability to use it in the context of something that is not a `DoFn`\r\n- The ability to use a different base class for a `DoFn` that
