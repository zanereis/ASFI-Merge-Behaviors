In Ambari, go to Metron -> Quick Links -> Swagger UI and go to the \"Meta Alert Controller\".\r\nClick on the create endpoint, and we'll want to send this request (but with the appropriate index subbed in):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"group_one\",\r\n    \"group_two\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"guidToIndices\": {\r\n    \"snort_test_1\":\"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\",\r\n    \"snort_test_2\":\"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nValidate that the metaalert was created and looks good:\r\n```\r\ncurl 'node1:9200/m*/_search?pretty'\r\n{\r\n  \"took\" : 3,\r\n  \"timed_out\" : false,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"successful\" : 1,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  },\r\n  \"hits\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"max_score\" : 1.0,\r\n    \"hits\" : [ {\r\n      \"_index\" : \"metaalerts\",\r\n      \"_type\" : \"metaalert_doc\",\r\n      \"_id\" : \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n      \"_score\" : 1.0,\r\n      \"_timestamp\" : 1504725383439,\r\n      \"_source\" : {\r\n        \"average\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"min\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"median\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"alert\" : [ {\r\n          \"msg\" : \"snort test alert\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\" : null,\r\n          \"ip_dst_port\" : \"8080\",\r\n          \"ethsrc\" : \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"is_alert\" : \"true\",\r\n          \"protocol\" : \"TCP\",\r\n          \"source:type\" : \"snort\",\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\" : \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n          \"ip_src_port\" : \"50187\",\r\n          \"guid\" : \"snort_test_1\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\" : \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"timestamp\" : 1504708744000\r\n        }, {\r\n          \"msg\" : \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\" : null,\r\n          \"ip_dst_port\" : \"8080\",\r\n          \"ethsrc\" : \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"is_alert\" : \"true\",\r\n          \"protocol\" : \"TCP\",\r\n          \"source:type\" : \"snort\",\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\" : \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n          \"ip_src_port\" : \"50187\",\r\n          \"guid\" : \"snort_test_2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\" : \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n          \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\" : 10,\r\n          \"timestamp\" : 1504708744000\r\n        } ],\r\n        \"max\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\" : 20.0,\r\n        \"count\" : 2,\r\n        \"guid\" : \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n        \"groups\" : [ \"group_one\", \"group_two\" ],\r\n        \"sum\" : 20.0,\r\n        \"status\" : \"active\"\r\n      }\r\n    } ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that both sub alerts are present, the various counts are filled in, a GUID has been given specifically to this meta alert, etc.\r\n\r\n### Searching\r\nSearching from the REST API works mostly as expected.  After the above data has been created, use the search endpoint to run this query:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 2,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"*\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"guid=snort_test_2\",\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"field\": \"_timestamp\",\r\n      \"sortOrder\": \"ASC\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe result should look similar to the following, and have the messages we'd expect (one from snort and one from metaalerts):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 2,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n        \"msg\": \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n        \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n        \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n        \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n        \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n        \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n        \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n        \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n        \"guid\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n        \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n        \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n      },\r\n      \"score\": 1,\r\n      \"index\": \"snort_index_2017.09.06.14\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n        \"average\": 10,\r\n        \"min\": 10,\r\n        \"median\": 10,\r\n        \"alert\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"msg\": \"snort test alert\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n            \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n            \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n            \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n            \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n            \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n            \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n            \"guid\": \"snort_test_1\",\r\n            \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"msg\": \"snort test alert 2\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:reason\": null,\r\n            \"ip_dst_port\": \"8080\",\r\n            \"ethsrc\": \"0A:00:27:00:00:00\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n            \"is_alert\": \"true\",\r\n            \"protocol\": \"TCP\",\r\n            \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n            \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\",\r\n            \"ip_src_port\": \"50187\",\r\n            \"guid\": \"snort_test_2\",\r\n            \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\",\r\n            \"threat:triage:rules:0:score\": 10,\r\n            \"timestamp\": 1504708744000\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"max\": 10,\r\n        \"threat:triage:score\": 20,\r\n        \"count\": 2,\r\n        \"guid\": \"d414a9f2-7a03-4e47-9108-16b6fc800dd3\",\r\n        \"groups\": [\r\n          \"group_one\",\r\n          \"group_two\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"sum\": 20,\r\n        \"status\": \"active\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"score\": 1,\r\n      \"index\": \"metaalerts\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/436292677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/436416372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1251#issuecomment-436416372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1251","id":436416372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjQxNjM3Mg==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T21:33:28Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T21:55:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Testing\r\n\r\n**Note** -

Modify /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        xpack.ssl.key:                     /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/esnode.key\r\n        xpack.ssl.certificate:             /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/esnode.crt\r\n        xpack.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ \"/etc/elasticsearch/ssl/ca.crt\" ]\r\n        xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true\r\n        xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Setup the client truststore\r\n\r\n    1. Import the Certificate Authority (CA). \r\n\r\n        * Specify an alias of your choosing. I chose \"elasticCA\". \r\n        * You'll also be prompted for a password, which must be at least 6 characters. I used \"apachemetron\".\r\n        * When prompted to \"Trust this certificate?\" type yes and hit enter.\r\n\r\n            ```\r\n            keytool -import -alias elasticCA -file /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/ca.crt -keystore clienttruststore.jks\r\n            ```\r\n\r\n    1. Import the data node certificate.\r\n        \r\n        * Specify an alias of your choosing. In fulldev use \"node1\" as it will need to match your hostname.\r\n        * Enter the password that you set when creating the truststore.\r\n\r\n            ```\r\n            keytool -importcert -keystore clienttruststore.jks -alias node1 -file /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/esnode.crt\r\n            ```\r\n\r\n    1. Put the truststore in the storm user home dir for the purpose of our tests.\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        mv clienttruststore.jks /home/storm/\r\n        chown storm:hadoop /home/storm/clienttruststore.jks\r\n        ```\r\n    \r\n1. Configure the Elasticsearch client in Metron\r\n\r\n    1. Load the passwords in HDFS for x-pack and the truststore\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        echo changeme > /tmp/xpack-password\r\n        echo apachemetron > /tmp/truststore-password\r\n        sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -mkdir /apps/metron/elasticsearch/\r\n        sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -put /tmp/xpack-password /apps/metron/elasticsearch/\r\n        sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -put /tmp/truststore-password /apps/metron/elasticsearch/\r\n        sudo -u hdfs hdfs dfs -chown metron:metron /apps/metron/elasticsearch/*\r\n        ```\r\n    \r\n    1. Modify the Metron global config with the SSL and X-Pack properties\r\n\r\n        * Pull down the latest global config\r\n\r\n            ```\r\n            $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PULL -o $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER -f\r\n\r\n            ```\r\n\r\n        * Update the configuration by adding the es.client.settings for xpack and SSL.\r\n\r\n            ```\r\n            \"es.client.settings\" : {\r\n                \"xpack.username\" : \"xpack_client_user\",\r\n                \"xpack.password.file\" : \"/apps/metron/elasticsearch/xpack-password\",\r\n                \"ssl.enabled\" : true,\r\n                \"keystore.type\" : \"jks\",\r\n                \"keystore.path\" : \"/home/storm/clienttruststore.jks\",\r\n                \"keystore.password.file\" : \"/apps/metron/elasticsearch/truststore-password\"\r\n            }\r\n            ```\r\n\r\n        * Push the changes to Zookeeper\r\n\r\n            ```\r\n            $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n            # Confirm your changes are there\r\n            $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -m DUMP -c GLOBAL\r\n            ```\r\n\r\n1. Restart Elasticsearch\r\n\r\n    __Note:__ The custom properties were never, and still are not exposed via the Elasticsearch MPack. Restarting via Ambari will overwrite any changes you make manually.\r\n\r\n    `service elasticsearch start`\r\n\r\n    * You should be able to connect to Elasticsearch via SSL in your browser: `https://node1:9200/_cat/health?v`.\r\n    * The Head plugin should also allow you to connect by slightly changing your URL to use https for SSL: `https://node1:9200/`\r\n\r\n1. Get rid of existing indexes so that we can easily tell that new data is flowing into Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n    __Note:__ Use \"node1\" for the hostname. Otherwise, the cert will fail, triumphantly announcing `curl: (51) SSL: certificate subject name 'node1' does not match target host name 'localhost'`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/ca.crt --user xpack_client_user:changeme -XDELETE \"https://node1:9200/squid*\"\r\n    curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/ca.crt --user xpack_client_user:changeme -XDELETE \"https://node1:9200/bro*\"\r\n    curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/ca.crt --user xpack_client_user:changeme -XDELETE \"https://node1:9200/snort*\"\r\n    curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/ssl/ca.crt --user xpack_client_user:changeme -XDELETE \"https://node1:9200/yaf*\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Restart the indexing topology\r\n\r\n    Ambari > Metron > Summary > Metron Indexing, choose restart\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/436802370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/436807013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1242#issuecomment-436807013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1242","id":436807013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjgwNzAxMw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-07T22:50:43Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T22:50:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Big effort and many thanks for this.

The last remaining bit before I merge this will be sharing some results around the performance/regression testing performed by @anandsubbu.\r\n\r\nI completed a set of performance comparison tests between the REST and Transport clients. Here's the update.\r\n\r\n### Note on the Testing Done\r\n* The performance regression comparison tests are run on a multi-node VM-based environment by:\r\na) Running a set of tests using the ES REST Client \r\nb) Swap out the REST client with the Transport client, and re-run the same set of tests.\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n1) The indexing rate numbers with the REST client is similar to that of the Transport client.\r\n2) I had noticed storm rebalance error messages for the kafkaSpout for both REST and Transport client runs, which required to adjust the values of `request.timeout.ms` and `session.timeout.ms` in the ES flux file under 'kafkaProps'. The errors were resolved after making these changes. \r\n3) For the REST client, I observed listener timeout exceptions with the default settings. I had to increase max retry and socket timeout values in global config as follows, in order to resolve the exceptions.\r\n```\r\n  \"es.client.settings\" : {\r\n    \"max.retry.timeout.millis\" : \"60000\",\r\n    \"socket.timeout.millis\" : \"60000\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n4) For both cases, the kafkaSpout complete latency was seen to be on the higher side (~30 secs)\r\n5) Lastly, I noticed that there were a number of failed tuples seen in the kafkaSpout of the RA Indexing topology. I am continuing to dig more into this, but since this was seen for both the REST and Transport client tests, I am suspecting it could be an anomaly with the test environment, or a different issue common to both REST/Transport clients.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, it is seen that there is no immediate regression in performance b/w the REST and Transport client. \r\n\r\n+1, great work @mmiklavc ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/437185100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/437235822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1014#issuecomment-437235822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1014","id":437235822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzIzNTgyMg==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T03:12:07Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T03:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is in, not sure why it isn't closed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/437235822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/437236527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1171#issuecomment-437236527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1171","id":437236527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzIzNjUyNw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T03:17:04Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T03:17:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nickwallen can we get a +1 on this?
