Hi, I have tested for this commit. \r\nThe API works well. \r\nBut failed when I use the python file to get the metrics because `'no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate'`. \r\nMaybe the authorization should be added to Request？Or am I using it in the wrong way?

Because before this change, dropping a job only needs one time of metadata deleting, but after this change, it needs n+1 times(n is the number of tasks). If one task failed to be deleted, an exception will be thrown which indicates the deletion is failed, but actually, the job's metadata has been deleted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/569616496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/569616514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1026#issuecomment-569616514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1026","id":569616514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTYxNjUxNA==","user":{"login":"asf-ci","id":40367165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzY3MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40367165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/asf-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-30T08:45:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T08:45:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/569616514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/569616515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1026#issuecomment-569616515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1026","id":569616515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTYxNjUxNQ==","user":{"login":"asf-ci","id":40367165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzY3MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40367165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/asf-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asf-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-30T08:45:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T08:45:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/569616515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
