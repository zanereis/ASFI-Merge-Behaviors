Here is how I convinced myself, let me know if that's wrong:\n\nNon-unique indexes: Each IM row contains the clustering key, so there are no conflict between rows. For conflicts between the IM delete and the IM update, we now use a pre-condition to suppress conflicting deletes and inserts. So, we should be fine with async operations.\n\nUnique indexes: They could conflict between rows. In some cases the compiler will add a blocking operator (a sort) to avoid those conflicts. Async should be ok for those. In other cases we might not have the blocking operator. For those, there is already a risk of false duplicate errors, so async is not fundamentally altering the picture. Also, the compiler uses a \"robust delete\", which also checks the clustering key, so that the IM operation does not delete an index row for another base table row.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/139315244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/139325645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/76#issuecomment-139325645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/76","id":139325645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTMyNTY0NQ==","user":{"login":"amandamoran","id":12958292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU4Mjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12958292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran","html_url":"https://github.com/amandamoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amandamoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T17:54:13Z","updated_at":"2015-09-10T17:54:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"jenkins,

In fact, the up query entry is sent so that other operators can do their part and push their operation to hbase. The async operation is forced to wait for completion after processing either a single down queue entry or multiple down queue entries depending upon the type of operator involved(Single row operation or rowset operation). \n\nIf the order of operations is important for unique indexes, then the async operation should be disabled. For the above use cases with the unique indexes, the async operation shouldn't be problem at all. I just went through these cases with Suresh and we think the order of operation is not needed due to pre-condition.\n\nFor the update command where-in the rows needs to be deleted before the new values can be inserted ( similar to updating a column value in a multi-column primary key), the plan is complex. The plan operates in async fashion for the old rows first and then operates in async fashion for the new rows.\n\nThanks to Suresh, we concluded that it should be ok to have async operation enabled for this case too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/139415581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/139419001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/76#issuecomment-139419001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/76","id":139419001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTQxOTAwMQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T00:38:14Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T00:38:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test Failed.\nhttps://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR/134/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/139419001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/139458840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/77#issuecomment-139458840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/77","id":139458840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTQ1ODg0MA==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-11T05:39:25Z","updated_at":"2015-09-11T18:20:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, just wanted to update the PR with this info.

The chain of logic is happening starting from the method\nobjExist(NABoolean createExternalTable). When ObjectUID fetched is 0 (or -1\nfor any error), the new code will try to create the external table and\nfetch the ObjectUID again.
