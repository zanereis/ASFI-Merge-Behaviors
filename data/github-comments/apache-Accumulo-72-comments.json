It includes:\r\n\r\n  1. bug fixes and fixes for build issues\r\n  2. Removing tracer from scripts\r\n  3. Addition of dependencies to export traces to Jaeger*\r\n\r\n*It's intended that these changes will be backed out as I had to include all of the transitive dependencies in the poms and component.xml for everything to run. There does appear to be dependency convergence issues between our jars and the dependencies of OpenTelemetry. With this commit I had to build the code with the `-Denforcer.skip` property to get past the dependency convergence checks.\r\n\r\nWith this commit I was able to build the binary tarball using `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Denforcer.skip` and visualize traces in [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Use the Jaeger [All-In-One](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.25/getting-started/#all-in-one) Docker image to start Jaeger.\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 -p 5775:5775/udp -p 6831:6831/udp -p 6832:6832/udp -p 5778:5778 -p 16686:16686 -p 14268:14268 -p 14250:14250 -p 9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.25\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the OpenTracing implementation to export to Jaeger by setting the following environment variable\r\n```\r\nexport OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=jaeger\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Then, in the same terminal where  step 2 was performed, start Accumulo.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that we might want to move the tracer module into it's own repository.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/912790866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/913212831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2254#issuecomment-913212831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2254","id":913212831,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM42boWf","user":{"login":"wx930910","id":22060531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDYwNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22060531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910","html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-05T19:19:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-05T19:19:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DomGarguilo I revised the code and use similar logic to create mock object by EasyMock, please let me know if you have any other suggestions!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/913212831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/913863466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2254#issuecomment-913863466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2254","id":913863466,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM42eHMq","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T21:44:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T21:44:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The build failed because of formatting issues - as said earlier, if you build locally it will automatically reformat the code.

I have tested with all three and will say that Jaeger seems to be the most user friendly. There is a `prometheus` option, but Prometheus has to be configured to pull/scrape metrics from an endpoint whereas the others use a push mechanism. I didn't bother configuring Prometheus to test it out.\r\n\r\n  To log the traces to the log file, do the following:\r\n  ```\r\n  export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=logging\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  To send the traces to Jaeger, do the following:\r\n  ```\r\n  docker run -d --name jaeger -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 -p 5775:5775/udp -p 6831:6831/udp -p 6832:6832/udp -p 5778:5778 -p 16686:16686 -p 14268:14268 -p 14250:14250 -p 9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.25\r\n  export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=jaeger\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  To send the traces to Zipkin, do the following:\r\n  ```\r\n  docker run --name zipkin -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin\r\n  export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=zipkin\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n### Trace UI\r\nThe Jaeger and Zipkin docker containers have a user interface for visualizing the traces.\r\n\r\n   Jaeger - http://localhost:16686/\r\n   Zipkin - http://localhost:9411/\r\n   \r\n### Start Accumulo\r\nI built the binary tarball, extracted in somewhere and started it locally.

I suspect that as the configurable timeout is increased, that the probability of this happening approaches zero (but never gets to zero).  The configurable expiration time reserves files for a user compactions while its queued.  I set it to 1 minute (not sure what a good default is, still thinking about that).  So for 1 minute after a user compaction is queued, a system compaction can not take any of the files reserved for it.  Once a user compaction has been queued for more than one min, then a system compaction could potentially compact some of the files.  After a user compaction starts running a system compaction can never take any of its files. \r\n\r\n\r\n> I'm wondering if the user compaction should preempt the system compaction.\r\n\r\nOne of the motivating cases for this change is a tablet with lots of files that is queued for really long periods for a user compaction.  For example if a tablet had 1000 files and a user compaction was initiated, then the tablet would reserve those files and queue a user compaction.  If the user compaction sat on the queue for 9 hours then during that time system compactions would not be able to work down the number of files (if system compactions had the capacity to do so).  I feel this potential problem is worth mitigating.  The question is, is the cure (and its potential to cause starvation) worse than the problem.    I feel that its not, but I don't have any numbers to back that up.  I will poke at the likelihood of starvation a bit more and see if I can roughly estimate it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/916253828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/916259625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2265#issuecomment-916259625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2265","id":916259625,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM42nQMp","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-09T16:37:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-09T16:37:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Expanding on the previous comment.

Before this change indefinite starvation could occur if a compactions was queued and higher priority compactions kept arriving while it was queued.  So I am thinking lets ignore that case and ask the question can this change cause starvation when only lower priority user compactions are arriving?  For this case I do not think indefinite starvation can occur.\r\n\r\nThere are two behaviors that avoid starvation\r\n * User compactions have an exclusive amount of time on the queue in which a system compaction can not remove them from the queue.\r\n * When a user compaction is removed from the queue by a system compaction, its guaranteed that the user compaction will be  requeued after that system compaction runs.  When its requeued it will have the exclusive time on the queue again.\r\n\r\nSo if a user compaction is queued and its next in line waiting for running compactions to finish, then there is a non-zero probability that one of those compactions will finish during its exclusive time.  I think this probability is a function of the average run time and number fo threads.  So if there are 2 threads, the average user compaction time is 5 mins, and the exclusive time is 1 mins then the probability that its gets to run in its exclusive time might be `1-(1-1/5)^2=.36`.  So in this case there is a 36% change its get to run during its first exclusive time.  If it does not get to run during its first exclusive time, then by the second condition above its guaranteed another exclusive time in which it will have another 36% chance to run.  So it will eventually run.\r\n\r\nAlternating between queued times and non-queued times does prolong the time it takes. I think it may do this in a linear manner.  If the exclusive time is 1 min and the average system compaction takes 2 min (during which its not queued for user compaction), then user compactions may take on average 3 times as long to actually start running because they spend 2/3 of the time with a 0% chance of running the compaction and 1/3 of the time with a X% chance of running the compaction where X>0.\r\n\r\nOne possible wrinkle in the above argument is that system compactions may lower the number of files which lowers the priority of subsequently queued user compactions for the tablet.  However system compactions based on the compaction ratio do not continually lower the number of files, but converge to an average number of files based on the compaction ratio, tablet size, and size of incoming files. So there will not be a situation where the priority continually decreases as system compactions occur, it will oscillate within a range as new files arrive and system compactions occur.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/918341165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/919289779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2270#issuecomment-919289779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2270","id":919289779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM42yz-z","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T16:00:09Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T16:00:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Without understanding the code - it seems that internalJob and externalJob miss a chance to provide context with what they are doing, esp. if strictly related to compactions. \r\n\r\nWe could add \"compaction\" to the names but that seems unnecessary as they are only used within the `CompactionExecutor` and tserver.compaction package. If you follow the code from tserver, it is more clear then taken out of context in a PR. A `CompactionJob` is the immutable object that will get run. A `SubmittedJob` is a wrapper around a `CompactionJob`, that provides the status. Then `ExternalJob` and `InternalJob` are two types of `SubmittedJob` that can be run.\r\n\r\n> Also, although task and job are interchangeable, task seems to imply something that is narrow in scope and maybe just a step - job seems to imply larger and self contained. Like you submit a MR job that can contain multiple tasks. So not sure what is more appropriate in this context.\r\n\r\nIt seems we could settle on Job here as a name for a unit of work.
