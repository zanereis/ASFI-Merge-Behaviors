Thank you for contribution! \n\nBefore a deep dive into the code, I have a question - could you pelase explain the use-case you have in mind for this feature? \n\nI'm trying to understand in particular what is the benefit of introducing complexity of SNTP support in the Zeppelin codebase (not sure that `Notebook.java` is the best place for it either), versus just scheduling a notebook using existing scheduller, that just loads the SNTP library (using %dep) and then sends any template out.\n\nSee [#8 from this notebook](https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer/notebooks/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2J6ei96ZXBwZWxpbi1naXRodWItYXJjaGl2ZS9tYXN0ZXIvbm90ZWJvb2svMkFaWjJNSFZHL25vdGUuanNvbg) for an example of the data product, that uses this approach for sending out email notifications.
