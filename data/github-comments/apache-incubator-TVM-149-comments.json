:  I have some thoughts regarding your suggestion to the possibility of a merged program analysis framework between RelayIR and HalideIR between issue [3895](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/3895) and this current issue.  I found @DKXXXL 's proposal here clean and intuitive in a way that it does not require building of CFG.  This is leveraging the restrictive control flow capability inherent in the HalideIR (i.e. the IR only supports for and if-then-else), although it would be good to bring to clarity the current proposal of how 'location' information is to be tracked.   If the proposal needs to be extended to handle RelayIR, which needs to handle function-as-first-class citizen (now CFA is needed), as well as 'reference' (a.k.a. pointer analysis) introduced as a result of autodiff, the framework would need to be more comprehensive.  Perhaps I'm not fully understanding the RelayIR, but are you thinking along the line of https://plum-umd.github.io/abstracting-definitional-interpreters/ for a program analysis framework as a complete solution?  Or, you're just thinking a global analysis framework (i.e. some global data structure that keeps up-to-date analysis information across different passes)?  Comments appreciated!

Can the usage/development of AAM/ADI lead to a good enough data representation of \"location\" for the compiler-pass developer to easily use it to query about Dataflow-Info or other info?\r\n\r\n***\r\n**First EDIT**: In the following , `add(x,x)` is not a good enough example. We can have a better example in HalideIR : \r\n```python\r\nBlock {\r\n  x = a  # Assignment A\r\n  Block {\r\n    ...\r\n    Block {\r\n      x = a # Assignment B\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the above code, Assignment A and Assignment B are actually represented using same ASTNode in the memory. Thus when a pointer to the \"x=a\" is queried about, there is an ambiguity whether the Dataflow-Info right before the first `x` or the second `x` is asked.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Detailed Version**:\r\nI notice that both in HalideIR and RelayIR, we don't explicitly require AST to really be a tree but a DAG. That means a pointer to an ASTNode cannot easily represent a precise location in the program. For example, in HalideIR, `add(x,x)` might be a node with two pointers pointing to one node,  however, using the pointer to `x` will lead to ambiguity of position -- is the user asking for the Dataflow-Info right before the first `x` or the second `x`?\r\n\r\nThe part in HalideIR is still fixable, at least a brutal way in mind is to just make DAG into a real tree; I also have another idea to fix that but the modification is not as simple as the current proposal, and I am currently concerned about how well-adapt this another solution is in this context of IRFunctor. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I think the first brutal solution cannot adapt to RelayIR because it seems like (from the documentation) the semantic of DAG and Tree is different in RelayIR?\r\n\r\nBasically, when the current compiler-pass developer wants to get Dataflow-info, in the current context, the signature of IRMutator/IRFunctor/IRVisitor only provides \"NodeRef\" as default. As above suggested (the ambiguity using NodeRef to represent location) **I tend to believe this signature will have to extend if the compiler-pass developer wants to get Dataflow-Info.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/565901356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/565925649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4526#issuecomment-565925649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4526","id":565925649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTkyNTY0OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-16T06:37:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T06:37:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting, please open a new thread on https://discuss.tvm.ai/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/565925649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/565928735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4527#issuecomment-565928735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4527","id":565928735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTkyODczNQ==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-16T06:50:34Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T06:50:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@liangfu thank you for issuing the fix!
