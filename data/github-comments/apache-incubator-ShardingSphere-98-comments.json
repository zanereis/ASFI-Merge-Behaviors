@fantacy2001 ,\r\n\r\nShardingSphere need you configured actual data nodes if you want to shard both datasources and tables. If there are no `actualDataNodes` configured, ShardingSphere can't know what's the Possible shardingNodes which should be input into your sharding algorithms.\r\n\r\nFor your situation, I think you can have a try like follow:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndataSources:\r\n  ds_0: !!com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource\r\n    driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\r\n    jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo_ds_0?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8\r\n    username: root\r\n    password:\r\n  ds_1: !!com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource\r\n    driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\r\n    jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo_ds_1?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8\r\n    username: root\r\n    password:\r\n\r\n\r\nshardingRule:\r\n  tables:\r\n    tableA: \r\n      actualDataNodes: ds_0.tenantId&->{1..2},ds_1.tenantId{3..4}   \r\n    tableB:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds_0.tenantId&->{1..2},ds_1.tenantId{3..4} \r\n  defaultDatabaseStrategy:\r\n    stardard:\r\n      shardingColumn: xxx\r\n      preciseShardingAlgorithm: ${your.algorithm}\r\n  defaultTableStrategy:\r\n    stardard:\r\n      shardingColumn: yyy\r\n      preciseShardingAlgorithm: ${your.algorithm}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand map the actual tableName in your algorithms.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/590175902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/590180337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/4432#issuecomment-590180337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4432","id":590180337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDE4MDMzNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T06:13:55Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T06:13:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/4432?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4432](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/4432?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/commit/b3f9fefe0d0a20aab409b851193990106d8e536d?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/4432/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=ZvlXpWa7so&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/4432?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##             master    #4432   +/-   ##\n=========================================\n  Coverage     54.64%   54.64%           \n  Complexity      330      330           \n=========================================\n  Files           954      954           \n  Lines         18215    18215           \n  Branches       3374     3374           \n=========================================\n  Hits           9953     9953           \n  Misses         7618     7618           \n  Partials        644      644\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/4432?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/4432?src=pr&el=footer).
