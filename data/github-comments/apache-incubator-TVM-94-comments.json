However, maybe I find one potential issue we didn't consider in code. Let us imagine the LHS shape is not the same as RHS shape. For example, TFLite input layout is [1, 16, 32, 180], RHS shape is [180]. Then we should got [1, 16, 32, 180]. However, we transpose input layout be [1, 180, 16, 32], then RHS shape is [180]. In code, we just pass this condition. So we gout [1, 180, 16, 32] + [180], which couldn't do broadcast.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve is:\r\n- Transpose LHS be NHWC\r\n- Keep RHS be the same\r\n- Call _op.add\r\n- Transpose back to NCHW.\r\n\r\nMy origin plan is to support TFLite NHWC data layout as #2519 described after my quantization part is upstreamed done. However, if you are interested to support it , also welcome.

For this test case, if you replace that line with  \r\n```\r\nfunc = FunctionSetAttr(func, \"Primitive\", tvm::Integer(0));\r\n```\r\nit will work.

I've been on vacation these days. \r\n\r\nThere are two problems/bugs triggered by fusing from elemwise and broadcast ops.\r\n- There is a codegen error for the test case where we have the output like `(%x, %x)` because it will be scheduled twice as @vinx13 pointed out above. There are two solutions for this.\r\n  - Use a copy operator for the duplicate during fusion. This one should work but it introduces another operator.\r\n  - Guarantee that there is only one copy of a tensor stored in the `tensor_outs` here. I am not quite sure if this is the right fix. https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/552d4aa3587aa3a0443d050ceb324386489ff793/src/relay/backend/compile_engine.cc#L121\r\n\r\n- Some scalar tensors are not included in the schedule. I tried to do `compute_inline` only when the schedule exists in the schedule here: https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/552d4aa3587aa3a0443d050ceb324386489ff793/src/relay/backend/compile_engine.cc#L130 \r\nBut as @vinx13 mentioned, this is probably gonna be problematic for GPU. @vinx13 figured out the problem.\r\n> SliceLikeCompute takes two tensor inputs, data and shape_like. The second input is only used to calculate the attributes of topi function. Actually the tensor is not generated, only its shape is used. That's why scalars are not found in the schedule.\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure what's the best way to fix.\r\n\r\n@masahi @vinx13, please comment if I've missed anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/483917976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/483919600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2932#issuecomment-483919600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2932","id":483919600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzkxOTYwMA==","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T03:06:21Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T03:07:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhiics `compute_inline` only when the scalar exists in the schedule is the right fix.

That means unless the tuple is the final return value of the global function, the fusor should not stop at that point. One way to solve the problem is to treat the tuple which is the return value of the function and intermediate values differently, and not fuse through such tuples if they are marked as extern_ref ( by marking its children as Opaque).\r\n\r\nThis way we simplified the assumption of the primitive kernel. I also agree that it is useful to add additional checks to check such invariants(so tuple is not used as return value)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/484209651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/484211108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3035#issuecomment-484211108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3035","id":484211108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDIxMTEwOA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T18:36:37Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T18:36:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe that we will need a bit more discussion about what is happening here.

It has many changes. I plan to upstream it in dev 0.6. My original plan is to support TFLite NHWC after quantization part upstreamed,  the reason is we could leverage auto tuning of NCHW and see the performance of quantization model. The initial work is we did is faster than FP32 30% in Mobilenet V1 using spatial pack. We also find this is not the limit of quantization model, we could tensorize `q_conv2d` to get better performance. However, if we change the layout from NCHW to NHWC, we should have some additional work to do, for example auto tuning of NHWC support (including conv2d and depthwise convolution). All right, I could start to do this work firstly to support TFLite NHWC and upstream it before quantization part, because this work is much easier than quantization part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/484746869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
