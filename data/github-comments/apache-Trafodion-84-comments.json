I think this change is OK. I tried the unit test on a Red Hat Linux development workstation. The behavior I saw there was errno of 34 on both the strtod and strtold calls. I tried it also in Visual Studio 2015 on a Windows 8 box. There, errno was 0 on both calls. I'm guessing that in the environment where this fix was done, the behavior was different for the two calls. \"long double\" support is platform specific.

this fix would take care closing the LOB extract statement, it doesn't implement the streaming concept in true sense.  For streaming concept to work, Blob should be materialized only when the application issues Blob.getOutputStream().getBytes() method. It looks like we read the whole Blob data in chunks() and keeps it around in our driver layer. This will result in large java memory usage on the client side.\r\n \r\nAlso, we should close the LOB only when Blob.free() is called.  If the application fails to call Blob.free() and the Blob data is fetched once, the lob cursor should be closed, when the corresponding Statement or PreparedStatement object of the query that got the LOB column is closed.\r\n\r\nHowever, this problem exists in the driver before this PR.  I would suggest this problem is also taken care of.  Hence, I didn't review this code thoroughly.

Those methods can then be internally optimized, if need be\r\n-- there are other str methods which follow the same design. For example: str_cmp \r\n  internally calls memcmp, or str_cpy_all which internally calls memmove\r\n-- it makes it slightly inconvenient during debugging as one need to set breakpoint at\r\n   sprintf instead of str_sprintf that is shown in code. It may also cause issues to look at variables inside of\r\n   sprintf or other internal system method\r\n-- it can differentiate between a traf call and a non-traf call. For ex, a breakpoint to str_cpy_all\r\n  or str_sprintf can only be called by traf.
