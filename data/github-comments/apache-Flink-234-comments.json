Given this information we can configure the required MapViews (also reusing them across multiple aggregation functions). Also we don't need to an aggregation function but access the MapView directly and check for distinct input or not.\r\n\r\nThis would mean a bit more implementation effort for the code-generation, but be the cleaner design because we do not need to wrap aggregation function and accumulators.
