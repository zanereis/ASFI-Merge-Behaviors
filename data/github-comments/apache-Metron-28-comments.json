But there's still something not quite right in our deps. The build doesn't seem to find the artifacts even though they're in the reactor tree when I do that. I don't think it's trying to game the dependency mechanism, as Maven doesn't really differentiate between the artifacts and the module itself - they're pretty tightly coupled afa Maven is concerned. But absolutely agreed about the build order with the pom deps not having worked as intended (per your interleaved output above). I suspect you're right about the pom declaration behind handled differently, at least from a multi-threaded perspective. I'm unclear if this is a bug in Maven's multi-threaded mode or intended behavior, but we certainly don't need to deal with it here.\r\n\r\nWe should look at this further in a separate PR. While we're at it, we might even simplify things further and remove the profiles, which are typically used for building for different environments, not acting as virtual-modules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/296684373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/296686327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/538#issuecomment-296686327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/538","id":296686327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjY4NjMyNw==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T14:30:00Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T14:30:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc Added a quick note, and listed those dependencies off.

I am going to lay out all of the possibilities that I can think of just so that we don't leave any stone unturned.\r\n\r\n(1) Alter the Source of Telemetry - This is the option that you chose.  This has the downside that we now have a forked, external dependency that we are relying on you to maintain going forward.  That's a lot of work for you!\r\n\r\n(2) Use an Alternative Source of Telemetry - Is there an alternative to `DHCPDump` out there that we could use instead?  I think this would be the simplest approach assuming one exists.\r\n\r\n(3) Reunite lines at the parser - Each line would come in as a separate Kafka message.  We cannot rely on ordering of those messages, so we would need some kind of unique identifier contained within each message to then reunite them all into a single DHCPDump record.  This would be very different from our current architecture and is not currently supported.\r\n\r\n(4) Transport Mechanism - How do you envision getting the DHCPDump records into Kafka? aka the transport mechanism?  No matter what, we need some kind of transport mechanism.  You could potentially create a solution that takes the separate record lines, stitches them into a single line, then pushes them to Kafka as a complete DHCPDump record.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/297032344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/297049919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/542#issuecomment-297049919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/542","id":297049919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzA0OTkxOQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T14:34:22Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T14:34:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.

The boundary for Metron is the Kafka message, not really the line, so if you can split the log into multi-line chunks prior to kafka, potentially with something like NiFi based on a delimiter. The way to do this is to use nifi to insert a true delimiter (not end of line) and then use the SplitContent to send individual log entries via kafka. It's a little heavy, but solves the multi-line problem as long as you're not going to crazy levels of throughput e.g. hundreds of thousands of EPS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/297087375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/297096746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/531#issuecomment-297096746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/531","id":297096746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzA5Njc0Ng==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T17:02:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T17:02:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> As an alternative method for getting DHCP data out of pcap, you might consider the existing Bro sensor, which essentially does what dhcpdump does...\r\n\r\nThe current Bro parser only supports HTTP and DNS records coming out of Bro.

Errors are intermittent and inconsistent. To complicate matters, this appears to be the case on master as well.\r\n\r\nI've been doing a pretty simple `while true; do date; mvn clean install; sleep 5; done >> ~/log_file 2>&1 ` to just run the build in a loop and see what comes up.  It's possible some of this is an artifact of running it in a loop like this, and I can definitely run it up in a Travis repeatedly to see if the same problems show (and I haven't seen Travis issues in a while that appear to be this branch's issue).  Having said that, it's worrying that our build is (very) unstable on both this branch and master when run like this.\r\n\r\nA lot of these seem to be related to our integration tests with the in memory components.  I don't see anything obviously wrong (although I did add some code to make sure ComponentRunners actually get cleaned up in finallys which may help a bit, but didn't resolve it).\r\n\r\nI'm not at all sure how to move forward on this, given that the state of master itself makes it almost impossible (unless someone has a clever idea!) to know if each issue is in this branch or not since every issue is intermittent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/297375689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/297381779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/459#issuecomment-297381779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/459","id":297381779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzM4MTc3OQ==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T12:03:48Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T12:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think you're suffering from the same intermittent issues we have on master.
