I honestly do not see any benefits over the \"native executor\" proposal by @nuclearpinguin #6750. KNative one implements subset of the functionality of the \"native executor\" by adding many more components that are not really needed to get what we want (http server, knative, istio) without real benefit and with limitations introduced by KNative. The \"native executor\" has a chance to be the fastest, most reliable, easily scalable and simplest executor we can think about.
