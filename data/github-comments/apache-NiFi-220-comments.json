It worked great with just one nit-picky exception:\r\n\r\nThe time for expiration is normalized to seconds. Technically speaking, expiration time can be in sub-seconds. In reality, this makes very little sense to have such fine-grained resolution. Perhaps, the most appropriate solution should be to have the expiration validation disallow sub-second resolution. I only point it out because the rules do break if if sub-second expiration is specified. I am not recommending changing the analysis rule though.\r\n\r\nGreat updates/improvements in the PR which affected existing flow analysis rule, `RestrictBackpressureSettings`. It makes things a bit cleaner and takes advantage of some Java 21 mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThere remains an issue where the 'Go to component' takes you to the upstream component rather than the affected Connection.

I wasn't aware of that PR. In the future, for a PR like that, which is going to make huge changes and/or change conventions, it is probably best to start with a [DISCUSS] thread on the mailing list to ensure that the right eye balls are on. I do (very much!) appreciate you taking the initiative to consolidate all of that into a single naming convention. The concern that I have is that I'd argue that the proper convention would be propertyDescriptors and relationships, saving all-caps naming conventions for constants. This separation is used throughout the codebase, especially the framework / \"engine\".\r\n\r\nBut now that you've done the hard work of making things consistent, we can easily change the naming convention with a \"find & replace all\" should that be decision made, so thanks for that!

This creates an edge case where valid file paths containing EL become invalid, as they are incorrectly parsed as JSON.\r\n\r\nBy introducing a dedicated property for the filename, we can:\r\n\r\n- Clearly distinguish between inline JSON specs and file-based specs.\r\n- Ensure correct handling of EL, whether used for JSON content or file paths.\r\n- Improve maintainability by eliminating ambiguity in `JOLT_SPEC`.\r\n\r\n**Use of the Resource Abstraction**\r\n\r\nThe existing implementation already utilizes the `readTransform` method from the Jolt abstraction layer, which ensures proper handling of file paths and JSON parsing. Additionally, necessary validations are already in place to verify that the file path is valid before processing.\r\n\r\nCould you clarify if the concern is specifically about file access within `readTransform`, or if it is a general recommendation to adopt NiFi's Resource abstraction for consistency? If required, I can explore integrating `ResourceReference` to enhance how NiFi handles file-based properties.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2629217087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2629247822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9682#issuecomment-2629247822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9682","id":2629247822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6ctyNO","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-02T05:15:50Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T05:15:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the quick reply @yakshup.\r\n\r\nOn closer evaluation, the current behavior of `JoltTransformJSON` has an unnecessary conditional around the Expression Language evaluation.

The updates to `nifi.cmd start` include this change so that the NiFi process starts in the background and the command returns to the prompt. The previous behavior left the command running in the same prompt window, blocking further use of that prompt window. The behavior adjustment aligns more closely to `nifi.sh start` on Linux and macOS, starting NiFi in the background and returning to the command prompt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2631079310/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2631080598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9684#issuecomment-2631080598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9684","id":2631080598,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6c0xqW","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-03T13:58:05Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T13:58:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Tested for the specified use-case, looks good. ref: #9682\r\n> \r\n> Just check the affected Test Cases.\r\n\r\nThanks for the verification @yakshup, and for raising the issue!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2631080598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2631305934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9674#issuecomment-2631305934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9674","id":2631305934,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6c1orO","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-03T15:19:30Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T15:19:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I appreciate you merging this PR.

Nice to know someone is providing momentum for this aspect of the project.\r\n\r\nI pulled your PR commits and ran the Kafka ITs, and I see the same errors as the CI.  I agree that the `kafka-cp` version bump is a good idea.  It might be nice at some point to hoist that out of the code, but no need here.\r\n\r\nThere is a particular test `KafkaConnectivityIT` that I used to verify the testcontainers harness (avoids NiFi), so I started there.  Since that worked, I moved on.  I was able to narrow things down by running `Kafka3ConnectionServiceSSLIT` by itself, and noted this error in the Kafka container startup log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:34 ===> User\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:34 uid=1000(appuser) gid=1000(appuser) groups=1000(appuser)\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:34 ===> Configuring ...\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:34 Running in KRaft mode...\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:37 ===> Running preflight checks ... \r\n2025-02-04 13:54:37 ===> Check if /var/lib/kafka/data is writable ...\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:37 ===> Running in KRaft mode, skipping Zookeeper health check...\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:37 ===> Using provided cluster id 4L6g3nShT-eMCtK--X86sw ...\r\n2025-02-04 13:54:38 Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error creating broker listeners from 'PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:9092,CONTROLLER://0.0.0.0:9094,BROKER://0.0.0.0:9093': No security protocol defined for listener CONTROLLER at kafka.utils.CoreUtils$.listenerListToEndPoints(CoreUtils.scala:216) at kafka.server.KafkaConfig.listeners(KafkaConfig.scala:1104) at kafka.server.KafkaConfig.<init>(KafkaConfig.scala:754) at kafka.server.KafkaConfig.<init>(KafkaConfig.scala:545) at kafka.tools.StorageTool$.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis suggested that the use of `ConfluentKafkaContainer` somehow added another listener, which needed to be accounted for in the startup configuration for the non-plaintext Kafka instances.\r\n\r\nHere is a patch you can apply to your PR (3 lines).  The first is the image version update.  The other two configure the Kafka container to start with the additional needed listener configuration.  With these changes, I ran:\r\n\r\n`greyp9/nifi/nifi-extension-bundles/nifi-kafka-bundle % mvn verify -P integration-tests` successfully.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, my use of `org.testcontainers.containers.KafkaContainer` with `confluentinc/cp-kafka` was wrong.  I gather from reading up, and the test output, that `org.testcontainers.kafka.ConfluentKafkaContainer` should have been used from the start.  So thanks for fixing this defect!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2634932870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2634934089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9690#issuecomment-2634934089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9690","id":2634934089,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6dDedJ","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-04T19:57:27Z","updated_at":"2025-02-04T19:57:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will

Implementing it is not trivial as you noted, and some past work around this didn't go forward due to initial usability concerns, so it is an open area.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Flow Analysis Rules space has fewer examples right now, this is an area where it is important to provide generally usable and understandable components, just like Processors. In other words, too many knobs can be counter-productive long term. For that reason, and for the use of the `nifi-framework-api`, I don't think this rule provides a good general pattern as it stands.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2635026776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2636886963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9693#issuecomment-2636886963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9693","id":2636886963,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6dK7Oz","user":{"login":"rfellows","id":713866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows","html_url":"https://github.com/rfellows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-05T13:41:28Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T13:41:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2636886963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2636932664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9685#issuecomment-2636932664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9685","id":2636932664,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6dLGY4","user":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-05T14:00:24Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T16:21:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Based on previous comments and a general theme that emerged, I did some refactoring.
