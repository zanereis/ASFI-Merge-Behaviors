I am in agreement that we should do our best to match other classes and patterns we already have.  I will continue studying that to see where we can make things more consistent.  If you can provide some examples that demonstrate your ideas that would help me understand it better.  \r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the strategy pattern was used in the UnifiedEnrichmentBolt because there are 2 separate strategies for enriching a message:  enrichment and threat intel.  Do we need the strategy pattern here since there is only one parser running strategy?  We could implement this as a strategy pattern in anticipation of one day needing another parser running strategy.  Do you think it's worth doing now or later when we need it?\r\n\r\nThe other difference I see is that Future objects are used to join the different messages after they are processed in parallel.  I believe this is done because all enrichments/threat intel must be done before the message can be pieced back together and sent along.  In this case we don't have that limitation.  The documents that are parsed do not depend on each other and can be passed along as soon as they are processed.  We are set up for post-processing these documents in parallel but I see that as a low-latency operation and I'm not sure it's worth the extra overhead.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/426783765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/426807836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1213#issuecomment-426807836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1213","id":426807836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjgwNzgzNg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-03T21:20:33Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T21:20:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just pushed a commit out based on some feedback from Nick: \r\n\r\n- The stellar context is now passed into the ParserRunner abstraction as a dependency.

my commit, I have moved all the UI related elements from REST to the PCAP config tab.\r\n> \r\n> In my understanding, the following parameters are not directly related to the PCAP core service, but

I guess I don't care either way. @nickwallen's suggestion of making that an interface, that I see you've implemented, should work well there also. There's definitely some impedance mismatch between what's in parsers vs enrichment, so there won't be a direct mapping of concepts.\r\n\r\n@nickwallen - I've been going back and forth about which approach to take in handling success/errors. I think I agree with you and prefer keeping the runner interface simpler by simply returning a `List<SomethingResulty>`. The fact that we have to jump through hoops a bit for callbacks because of needing reference to the Tuple in onSuccess suggests to me that it's probably better to manage the results in a returned list. The validation on the runner is also simpler in this case as well, ie no need to validate you've set your callbacks. Having onSucess/Error methods in the runner interface feels a little fishy to me. I also think that it makes some sense to decouple the parsing phase from writing altogether, though I recognize that callbacks are not opinionated about the \"what\" that happens in success/error would be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/427086826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/427096884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1213#issuecomment-427096884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1213","id":427096884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzA5Njg4NA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T17:08:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T17:08:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't feel that strongly about either approach so I'll switch it to return a list and remove the callbacks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/427096884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/427162966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1213#issuecomment-427162966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1213","id":427162966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzE2Mjk2Ng==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-04T20:45:07Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T20:45:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The latest commit removes the callbacks.

Actually not sure what to do about this.  I think we'd have to set the base folder name of the tar appropriately at creation time, but the catch is that we sign everything so it's set in stone when we do.

There are a couple different tests that verify certain fields are defined with the correct types and I made sure the internal fields (including `alert_status`) are covered.  The one potentially confusing change is that a couple test fields are added to the OOTB ES templates before these tests are run.  This was necessary for the existing tests to continue working without major changes.  \r\n\r\nI think this should cover it.
