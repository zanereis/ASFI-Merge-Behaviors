The documentation implies that `all datasource access of all_datasource_access` allows users to see slices using all datasources, not create slices or create dashboards\r\n\r\nFrom the security documentation:\r\n\r\n> * Data source: For each data source, a permission is created. If the user does not have the all_datasource_access permission granted, the user will only be able to see Slices or explore the data sources that are granted to them\r\n\r\nI'm reading that as \"Granting `datasource access on <specific data source>` lets the user see Slices or explore data on that specific data source. Granting `all_datasource_access` lets the user see Slices or explore data on all data sources\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Model permissions are used to let a user add / edit slices and dashboards. If I don't give the user `can_add` on Dashboards, then they are not allowed to create dashboards.\r\n\r\n> * Model & action: models are entities like Dashboard, Slice, or User. Each model has a fixed set of permissions, like can_edit, can_show, can_delete, can_list, can_add, and so on. By adding can_delete on Dashboard to a role, and granting that role to a user, this user will be able to delete dashboards.\r\n\r\nAm I reading that wrong?

dashboards?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/331150283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/331180684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3433#issuecomment-331180684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3433","id":331180684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTE4MDY4NA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-21T14:50:28Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T14:50:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

Just because pandas is so simple for this.\r\n\r\nSee how time grain is fairly loosely defined at the moment? https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs.py#L192\r\n\r\nOne easy approach would be add a corresponding pandas `freq` to each time grain. Knowing this, it would be easy to resample whenever needed.\r\n\r\n\"Resampling\" came before the \"Time-Grain\"  concept and is now confusing/obsolete. I feel like we could trigger the pandas resampling based on time grain configuration with a simple checkbox.\r\n\r\nIn that context, there may be some very few specific use cases where people may want the extra flexibility of resampling with specific fill patterns but I wouldn't be against deprecating the feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/331497859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/331498665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3512#issuecomment-331498665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3512","id":331498665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQ5ODY2NQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T16:42:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T16:42:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"An extra point for pandas vs having our own JS function for this is that pandas (from memory) deals nicely with timezones, such that when we want to start thinking about comprehensive time zone management pandas may do some of that magic too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/331498665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/331518075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3513#issuecomment-331518075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3513","id":331518075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTUxODA3NQ==","user":{"login":"Mogball","id":15016832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15016832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball","html_url":"https://github.com/Mogball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mogball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T17:57:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T17:57:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch is it alright if I just move the logic into a separate function?
