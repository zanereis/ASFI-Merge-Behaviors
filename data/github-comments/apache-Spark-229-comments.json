so I rebased this PR and made it mergeable in my own branch, https://github.com/mateiz/spark/tree/spark-931. However, in doing this I realized that there might be some problems here that are fundamental.\n\nThe main issue is that AppendOnlyMap, and ExternalAppendOnlyMap, require there's only one value for each key. The in-memory AOM will be very inefficient otherwise, and the EAOM depends on it. This means that for sort, we have to create (Key, ArrayBuffer[Value]) pairs, which will consume more memory by default than our in-memory sort, and will make us crash if there are too many identical values (something we do today but which may happen sooner here). Thus it seems that long-term we need a very different solution here, basically an external merge-sort. \n\nA second, possibly less serious issue is that the changes to EAOM to use comparator.compare instead of hash code equality make it less efficient in the default hashing-based case, because instead of saving one key's hash code in an Int and reusing it to compare with other keys in various places, we always recompute it when we compare each pair of elements.\n\nFor these reasons I'd actually hold off on merging this (even my merged version) until we implement an external merge-sort as part of sort-based shuffle. Then we can use that data structure here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49254607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49254626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1210#issuecomment-49254626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1210","id":49254626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjU0NjI2","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-17T03:24:31Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T03:24:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerryshao after looking more at #931, I'd actually like to hold off on merging that the way it's set up, so would you mind updating this now?
