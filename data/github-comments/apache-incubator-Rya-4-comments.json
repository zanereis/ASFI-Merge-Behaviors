Configurability was not a big driver of the decision.  The downside of the plugin approach is that IDEs do not by default know to use the plugin to start and stop the minicluster.  I think it is possible to configure the major ones to run maven goals before and after tests, but it seems like more work for the developer.  I usually do not like to use singletons, but I think this is a rare situation where a singleton is appropriate.  Note, that it would be possible to introduce a service loading layer to make a choice at runtime between the maven plugin, a lazy-singleton, and even a real accumulo cluster.  This introduces more complexity though so I went with what I deemed to be the simplest approach for both implementation and developer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/304147730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/305254470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rya/pull/162#issuecomment-305254470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/162","id":305254470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTI1NDQ3MA==","user":{"login":"meiercaleb","id":7217377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7217377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb","html_url":"https://github.com/meiercaleb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meiercaleb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T17:11:32Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T17:11:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"asfbot
