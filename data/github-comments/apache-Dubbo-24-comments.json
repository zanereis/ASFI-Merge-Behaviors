before.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/350425189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/350425365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/1021#issuecomment-350425365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1021","id":350425365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDQyNTM2NQ==","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-09T05:27:39Z","updated_at":"2017-12-09T05:27:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"因为现在大多数用dubbo的公司，为了避免极端情况下的雪崩和流量风暴，大部分接口都会关闭重试机制，这样，对于当前dubbo优雅停机的设定，就无法做到优雅停机了，所以这里通过比较简单的方式，加大了在不重试情况下优雅停机的成功率。\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.csdn.net/manzhizhen/article/details/78756370","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/350425365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/350425647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/1021#issuecomment-350425647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1021","id":350425647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDQyNTY0Nw==","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-09T05:33:55Z","updated_at":"2017-12-09T06:15:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"测试方案：\r\nA模块（consumer，部署单个）高并发调用B模块（provider，部署多个）某个接口，然后对B模块进行kill，看A模块是否报错。\r\n\r\nB模块是provider，会启动多个，端口号不同，配置和代码：\t\r\n```\r\n<dubbo:application
