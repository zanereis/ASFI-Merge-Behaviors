the other `@` shortcuts and the cron notation subscribe to the standard of having a clear schedule, and `execution_date` that line up. I'd rather phase out the support for time interval support than allowing for it on the cron notation side.\n\nThe better way to delay tasks is with data dependencies (sensors!) or a TimeDeltaSensor in the absence of it. \n\nChanging the schedule, especially while having `depends_on_past=True` will lead to all sorts of confusing clogging. The key is to move the start_date to something on your schedule.\n\nAn eventual `DAG.validate` method could check that start_dates fall onto an existing schedule, or something rounded when using timedeltas.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/180430885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/180491622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/951#issuecomment-180491622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/951","id":180491622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDQ5MTYyMg==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T18:37:37Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T19:27:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reporting this -- this is now fixed and awaiting merge.
