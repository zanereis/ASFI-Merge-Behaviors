How about adding some timeout property to the message?\n\nI knew that there is a timeout option for `ng-toast` but I chose not use it. The simple reason is that I consider the dependency issue is a **serious** issue so we want the user to **explicitly/manually** close the error popup and acknowledge that he is aware about the download issue.\n\nWhat is your opinion about that ? Adding a timeout to automatically close the error popup is very easy.\n\n>  Need to show \"Could not find artifact bbb:111.2.2.2 in central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)\" as well if we want to show the number of errors.\n\nThere is a simple explanation for this. `sonatye.aether` library tries to download the dependencies **one after another** and raise an exception as soon as it cannot find/download a dependency. In your example, we'll see the error popup for the 2<sup>nd</sup> dependency if the download of the 1<sup>st</sup> is successful\n\n``` java\n synchronized (repos) {\n      for (RemoteRepository repo : repos) {\n        collectRequest.addRepository(repo);\n      }\n    }\n    DependencyRequest dependencyRequest = new DependencyRequest(collectRequest,\n            DependencyFilterUtils.andFilter(exclusionFilter, classpathFilter));\n    try {\n      return system.resolveDependencies(session, dependencyRequest).getArtifactResults();\n    } catch (NullPointerException ex) {\n      throw new RepositoryException(String.format(\"Cannot fetch dependencies for %s\", dependency));\n    }\n```\n\nWe cannot change the behavior of `sonatype.aether`. We can change our source code to download dependency **one by one** but it is very slow and require changing the interface of a lot of methods\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/250898989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/250935588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1369#issuecomment-250935588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1369","id":250935588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDkzNTU4OA==","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-01T20:27:53Z","updated_at":"2016-10-01T20:27:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@astroshim @AhyoungRyu \n\nThe wrong counting on error popup is now fixed.
