Sorry for delay in responding...\r\n\r\nHere is what I believe should be happening.\r\n- The result for a query should be consistent in both using index or non-index case.\r\n\r\n- The query engine returns UNDEFINED when it is unable to find the next level field. \r\nE.g: if address.city and address is null (This is documented). \r\nThis is not same when you are looking for a non existing \"key\" in the map; UNDEFINED needs to be returned when positions is null and query is trying to access field from it. \r\nE.g.: positions['*']  should be returning UNDEFINED. \r\n\r\n- Query engine supports heterogenous objects stored in a region. \r\nE.g: Employee or Customer. \r\nInline with supporting this, its designed/architected such that if a field is not found in the object it will be ignored. \r\nE.g query with employeeID is not going to return customer objects unless it has that field. \r\n\r\n- To be inline with the above design (query expectation), when a map field is not present available it should ignore that entry/object from adding to the result.\r\nE.g. if positions['SUN'] if SUN key is not present query should ignore that object. \r\nThis is also different from null check.\r\nIf there is a SUN key with null value it should be returned for queries looking for null value. And non null check will return if the key is there and its value is not null.\r\nTry the query with non map field and the behavior should be same.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions on the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nThe overall behavior of the query on map should be in-line with non-map fields. \r\n\r\nThe usage of index should not be avoided; unless the results are inconsistent with non-index query results. Instead of avoiding/blocking the use of index, it will be good to address the issues with indexed queries and make the behavior consistent.\r\n\r\nCan you confirm above requirements are met in this PR.\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/811539256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/811626206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6245#issuecomment-811626206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6245","id":811626206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMTYyNjIwNg==","user":{"login":"moleske","id":12620096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIwMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12620096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske","html_url":"https://github.com/moleske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-01T04:18:00Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T04:18:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I assume there is some GEODE ticket associated with this..

Please, let me answer inline to your questions.\r\n\r\n> @albertogpz\r\n> Thanks for your contributions to make the query engine robust. Sorry for delay in responding...\r\n> \r\n> Here is what I believe should be happening.\r\n> \r\n>     * The result for a query should be consistent in both using index or non-index case.\r\n> \r\nThis is what I tried to fix with this PR and the test new cases now show that results are the same with and without indexes while prior to the PR, they returned different results.\r\n\r\n>     * The query engine returns UNDEFINED when it is unable to find the next level field.\r\n>       E.g: if address.city and address is null (This is documented).\r\n>       This is not same when you are looking for a non existing \"key\" in the map; UNDEFINED needs to be returned when positions is null and query is trying to access field from it.\r\n>       E.g.: positions['*']  should be returning UNDEFINED.\r\nSo, you mean if positions is not null but it only contains a mapping for the 'SUN\" key, positions[\"ERIC\"] should return null instead of UNDEFINED?\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Query engine supports heterogenous objects stored in a region.\r\n>       E.g: Employee or Customer.\r\n>       Inline with supporting this, its designed/architected such that if a field is not found in the object it will be ignored.\r\n>       E.g query with employeeID is not going to return customer objects unless it has that field.\r\n> \r\nok. That should not have been changed.\r\n\r\n>     * To be inline with the above design (query expectation), when a map field is not present available it should ignore that entry/object from adding to the result.\r\n>       E.g. if positions['SUN'] if SUN key is not present query should ignore that object.\r\n>       This is also different from null check.\r\n>       If there is a SUN key with null value it should be returned for queries looking for null value. And non null check will return if the key is there and its value is not null.\r\nCurrently if you have an entry for which positions has the following mappings: {\"SUN\" => null} and another entry for which positions has the following mapping: {\"ERICSSON\" => \"3\"} querying for positions[\"SUN\"] = null will return both entries.\r\nWith my PR, only the first one would be returned. What should be the right behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n>       Try the query with non map field and the behavior should be same.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Please let me know if you have any questions on the expected behavior.\r\n> \r\n> The overall behavior of the query on map should be in-line with non-map fields.\r\n> \r\n> The usage of index should not be avoided; unless the results are inconsistent with non-index query results. Instead of avoiding/blocking the use of index, it will be good to address the issues with indexed queries and make the behavior consistent.\r\n> \r\nI tried to support the use of indexes in all queries with my PR but I found no way to do it with != queries using an index of type: positions[*] (index on all keys) or positions[\"SUN\", \"ERICSSON\"].\r\nFor the second type of index, I have an alternative solution in a draft PR that will allow the use of the index although it is more costly in memory (see https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6238)\r\n\r\n> Can you confirm above requirements are met in this PR.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/814286023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/814287858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6200#issuecomment-814287858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6200","id":814287858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDI4Nzg1OA==","user":{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T17:11:55Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T17:11:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We had a small impromtu discussion with the query engine team and some research on how NoSQL treats null (or nil in some worlds)\r\n> \r\n>     * in MongoDB we founnd that\r\n>       `The { item : null } query matches documents that either contain the item field whose value is null or that do not contain the item field.`\r\n> \r\n>     * in redis nil is returned if the field does not exist.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Hence we think that the current behavior i.e. querying without indexes is the right result and we should try to make the indexes return the same result.\r\n\r\n@nabarunnag Thanks for your comments.
