Now the options are looked up in the hierarchical order of SESSION - SYSTEM - CONFIG, the session being given the highest precedence. So, if the user doesn't set system/session option by issuing alter system/session, option manager fetches the value from the config.  Now we need not bother about getting the value from config separately if it is not in the system/session level. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptionValue value = sessionOptions.getOption(JAVA_COMPILER_OPTION);\r\npolicy = CompilerPolicy.valueOf((value != null)\r\n    ? value.string_val.toUpperCase()\r\n    : config.getString(JAVA_COMPILER_CONFIG)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above code snippet we try to get option value and if it is not set (if it is null) we try to get it from Config. With my code changes if the value is not set at system/session level, value from the config is picked automatically.For example, the above can be simplified to:\r\n\r\n```\r\npolicy = CompilerPolicy.valueOf(sessionOptions.getOption(JAVA_COMPILER_OPTION));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have already externalized all the existing options in ExecConstants, PlannerSettings, etc., \r\nto the drill-module.conf. Following are the steps to add a new system/session option.\r\n\r\nSteps to add a new system/session option:\r\n\r\n1. Add a validator in the ExecConstants.java or PlannerSettings.java or whichever is appropriate for the option. For example: \r\n```\r\n           String NEW_OPTION_KEY = \"drill.exec.new_option\";\r\nOptionValidator NEW_OPTION= new DoubleValidator(NEW_OPTION_KEY);\r\n```\r\n2. Add the validator from the above step to the  validators list  in `SystemOptionManager.java`.\r\n\r\n3. Add the option in the conf file (for example, `drill-module.conf` or `drill-override.conf` file ) under the name space `drill.exec.options`.

The first issue is that, if the user can't do the sums to set the Drill memory allocation right (with respect to actual memory), not sure how they will get the total memory variable right.\r\n\r\nOK, so we get the memory from the system, then do a percentage. That is better. But, what is the system memory? Is it total memory? Suppose the user says Drill gets 60%. We can now check. But, Drill is distributed. Newer nodes in a cluster may have 256GB, older nodes 128GB. Drill demands symmetrical resources so the memory given to Drill must be identical on all nodes, regardless of system memory. So, the percent of total system memory idea doesn't work in practice.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe we express memory as the total *free* memory. Cool. We give Drill 60%. Drill starts and everything is fine. Now, we also give Spark 60%. Spark starts. It complains in its logs (assuming we make this same change to the Spark startup scripts.) But, Spark uses its memory and causes Drill to fail. We check Drill logs. Nada. We have to check Spark's logs. Now, imagine doing this with five apps; the app that complains may not be the one to fail. And, imagine doing this across 100 nodes. Won't scale.\r\n\r\nNote that the problem is that we checked memory statically at startup. But, our problem was that things changed later: we launched an over-subscribed Spark. So, our script must run continuously, constantly checking if any new apps are launched. Since some apps grow memory over time, we have to check all other apps for total memory usage against that allocated to Drill.\r\n\r\nNow, presumably, all other apps are doing the same: Spark is continually checking, Storm is doing so, and so on. Now, the admin needs to gather all these logs (across dozens of nodes) and extract meaning. What we need, then, is a network endpoint to publish the information and a tool to gather and report that data. We've just invented monitoring tools.\r\n\r\nTake a step back, what we really want to know is available system memory vs. that consumed by apps. So, what we want is a Linux-level monitoring of free memory. And, since we have other things to do, we want alerts when free memory drops below some point. We've now invented alerting tools.\r\n\r\nNow, we got into this mess because we launched apps without concern about the total memory usage on each node. That is, we didn't plan our app load to fit into our available memory. So, we turn this around. We've got 128GB (say) of memory. How do we run only those apps that fit, deferring those that don't? We've just invented YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes and the like.\r\n\r\nNow we get to the reason for the -1. The proposed change adds significant complexity to the scripts, *but can never solve the actual oversubscription problem*. For that, we need a global resource manager.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that someone wants to run Drill without such a manager. Perhaps some distribution does not provide this tool and instead provides a tool that simply launches processes, leaving it to each process to struggle with its own resources. In such an environment, the vendor can add a check, such as this one, that will fire on all nodes and warn the user about potential oversubscription *on that node*, *at that moment*, *for that app* in *one app's log file*.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this, we can do two things.\r\n\r\n1. In the vendor-specific `distrib-env.sh` file, do any memory setting adjustments that are wanted.\r\n2. Modify `drillbit.sh` to call a `drill-check.sh` script, if it exists, just prior to launching Drill.\r\n3. In the vendor-specific `distrib-env.sh` file, do the check proposed here.\r\n\r\nThe only change needed in Apache Drill is step 2. Then each vendor can add the checks if they don't provide a resource manager. Those vendors (or users) that use YARN or Mesos or whatever don't need the checks because they have overall tools that solves the problem for them.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326063619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326087948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/919#issuecomment-326087948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/919","id":326087948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjA4Nzk0OA==","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-30T19:03:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T19:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326087948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326088999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/919#issuecomment-326088999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/919","id":326088999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjA4ODk5OQ==","user":{"login":"sohami","id":22159459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU5NDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22159459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami","html_url":"https://github.com/sohami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-30T19:07:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T19:07:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@parthchandra -

to the general comments:\r\n\r\n> I think we need to limit the number of queries waiting for queues.\r\n\r\nPlease see the detailed notes. The ZK-based mechanism does not (AFAIK) provide the means to limit queue size. This is why this feature is preliminary, and may be why it has been disabled, though it has been available in the code for several years.\r\n\r\n> For short queries, this feature might add more overhead/latency (going to zookeeper, extra synchronization mechanisms added etc.). This will be a problem with high concurrency. Did we quantify that ?\r\n\r\nThis is not a feature for situations of very high concurrency (= very small queries). It is a feature for situations in which a cluster runs enough distributed queries that the cluster becomes overloaded. For the case with 1000s of small, single-node queries, a app could use the framework provided to implement an in-process queue. In fact, one exists, but it is intended for unit tests.\r\n\r\n> Not being to cancel once enqueued is also a problem. Can we do that by having cancel release the semaphore ?\r\n\r\nYes, cancelation is an issue. Since the ZK-based queues were an existing feature, I didn't dive too deeply into how they handle query cancellation. This would be a good area for QA to exercise. \r\n\r\n> Also, does semaphore count give an indication how many are waiting in the queue ?\r\n\r\nThere is no ready means to determine this, though I suspect that something could be put together that queries the internal znode and counts the ephemeral nodes that represent waiting processes. Doing so would be handy to display queue size in the Drill web UI. This would be a good enhancement once we prove that the basic mechanism works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326707239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326785952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/927#issuecomment-326785952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/927","id":326785952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjc4NTk1Mg==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-03T05:49:37Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T05:49:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326785952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326787864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/910#issuecomment-326787864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/910","id":326787864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjc4Nzg2NA==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-03T06:53:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T06:53:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326787864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/326809152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/904#issuecomment-326809152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/904","id":326809152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjgwOTE1Mg==","user":{"login":"weijietong","id":728692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong","html_url":"https://github.com/weijietong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-03T14:42:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-03T14:42:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@vvysotskyi has updated the mentioned parts.

To correct this I am doing the following:\r\n\r\n- OptionType seems to be I'll defined. I think the intention is that it defines the levels in which an option can be configured. This should be a static property tied to an option (much like a validator). In reality it looks like the OptionType of an option can be changed depending on where it is set, which is incorrect behavior. I think this came about because it is the user's responsibility to define the OptionType for an option value which is in correct.\r\n- OptionScope will define the level at which the option was set\r\n\r\nTo solidify the semantics I am doing the following:\r\n\r\n- OptionManagers no longer allow an option value to be set. Only the following methods are exposed: \r\n```\r\nvoid setLocalOption(String name, boolean value);\r\nvoid setLocalOption(String name, long value);\r\nvoid setLocalOption(String name, double value);\r\nvoid setLocalOption(String name, String value);\r\nvoid setLocalOption(OptionValue.Kind kind, String name, String value);\r\n``` \r\nDoing this prevents the possibility of defining an incorrect scope or type. The option type is now determined by the static option definition. The option scope is determined by the option manager on which the option was set.\r\n\r\n- I have also cleaned up the OptionManager interface so that it does not require the option type to be passed to the delete methods. This helps clean up the semantics further because OptionType was being overloaded to define both where an option can be set and which option manager can set it. This is unclear because some options can be set exclusively at one level (e.g. only the session level) whereas other options can be set at multiple levels (e.g. system and session levels). It also introduces the possibility for error by allowing the user to provide the wrong type to the wrong option manager.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/327960944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/327972301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/934#issuecomment-327972301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/934","id":327972301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzk3MjMwMQ==","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T01:14:37Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T01:14:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers Please review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/327972301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/328245831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/923#issuecomment-328245831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/923","id":328245831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODI0NTgzMQ==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-09T01:28:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T01:28:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers Finished applying comments, and cleanup.

The premise of this bug seems to be that we corrupt Parquet dates and convert perfectly valid 4-digit years into invalid 5-digit years. That is clearly a data corruption bug that should never occur. Why don't we fix that?\r\n\r\nGiven that we've accepted the data corruption, we need to display five-digit years which the Java classes for date and time don't support in `toString()`. The code uses `toString()` because it does not do correct formatting using the classes provided. That's the second bug. Date display should make use of format preferences provided by the user, not the default ones provided by `toString()`. So, that's bug number 2.\r\n\r\nNow given the above two bugs, we introduce a third by creating ad-hoc, Drill-specific date/time classes, violating the JDBC standard, to display the corrupt five-digit years. So, no longer will Drill return the java.sql.Date class as specified by the standard, but rather our own subclass. How will this affect client code that relies on standard behavior?\r\n\r\nI feel we are compounding error upon error. Can we go back and fix the original problem: that users might prefer that we don't corrupt dates in their data? That is, the problem is not so much that we don't format corrupt data correctly, but rather that we do, in fact, corrupt data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/328307788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/328307840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/919#issuecomment-328307840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/919","id":328307840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODMwNzg0MA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-09T22:44:26Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T22:44:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sohami, can you clean up the stray commits and ask @parthchandra to again review the later commits?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/328307840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/328312340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/928#issuecomment-328312340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/928","id":328312340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODMxMjM0MA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-10T00:47:52Z","updated_at":"2017-09-10T00:47:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jinfengni, can you take a quick look at the Foreman changes?
