you for contributing @mfelgamal ! Apache Beam interpreter is a valuable contribution many people are looking for.\n\nThere are few things that need to be done before we can merge it though:\n- this branch need to be rebased on top of the latest master (`git rebase master`) and conflicts must be resolved\n- establish the authorship of this work: this PR includes commits by you and @FouadMA  \n- make sure that every file in this PR, as any other file in ASF project, contain Apache2.0 license header\n- make sure that every file is formatted according to [project's code conventions](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-convention): pom.xml, .jave, etc. \n  From the quick glance at the Java code:\n  - please make sure you follow the conventions that are used in Zeppelin projects: brackets, sl4j logging. Best way is to look at other interpreters code\n  - classes should have comments explaining their purpose and extra empty lines as well as `@author` tags need to be removed\n  - `zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license` must be updated to _include ALL dependencies, AND their transitive dependencies_ that were added in this PR. You can see all of them in `mvn dependency:tree`.\n\nPlease, feel free to ping me after those issues are addressed and will be happy to look more into it and help you getting this merged!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240107971/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/240121887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1231#issuecomment-240121887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1231","id":240121887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDEyMTg4Nw==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T14:37:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T14:37:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for your explanation, what's your progress on refactoring current impelemtation? \n\nLet me try to re-visit points 1-5.

a single line of configuration change. \n1. listing existing notes that shared through Bittorrent\n   \n    Could we use Mutable item to save a list of hashes of all notebooks, stored by this

listing revisions for each note\n   \n    Can each Note have a publicKey, so we could store a list of all revisions for each note as a Mutable item?\n4. importing new note by hashcode (should work similar to current \"import by URL\")\n   \n    Hashcode should be good indeed, but this might still require changes that are discussed in #989\n\nLet me know what you
