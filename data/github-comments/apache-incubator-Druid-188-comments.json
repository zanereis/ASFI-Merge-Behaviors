I suppose each one would need to be its own file. I would support moving them there, and maybe making them optional.

The \"new\" (i.e. since JDK7) NIO system (i.e. `Path`) is more flexible and also provides support for other file system like jimfs. (You can switch between both APIs by using `.toFile()` and `.toPath()`, which works well as long as they refer to the default file system.)\r\n\r\nI tend to use the newer NIO system for more flexibility and especially jimfs for more realistic tests.\r\nIf you worry too much about this kind of change it would be perfectly fine to drop the last commit and go with the EasyMock solution.\r\n\r\nMaybe the change could also start a discussion to leverage the code to more modern java.

Storing audit logs in deep storage (like task reports) seems like a better idea to me than the metadata store.
