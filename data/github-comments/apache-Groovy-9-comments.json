to the change itself, but I feel it does not solve GROOVY-7646, because that should have not been happening even without you removing classes from the cache actively. I can for example change the eval script to contain a class besides the script class and then it should blow up again. Furthermore, Eval just uses GroovyShell. So you should get the same problem with GroovyShell too. So in my opinion your fix is not addressing the underlying issue\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/216117225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/216122039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/304#issuecomment-216122039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/304","id":216122039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjEyMjAzOQ==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T07:22:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T07:22:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Given that both 0x and 0X are supported for hexadecimal (similarly 0b and 0B for binary), I have no problem with supporting 0O, but I would expect that we would regard it as bad style, the same way we regard lowercase L bad style for long since it can be confused more easily with number 1.

I agree with you that this does not address the underlying issue, for that I believe that PR #219 does.  The root problem I believe is that `ClassInfo` keeps a strong reference to it's `Class` so it can never be removed from the static `globalClassValue` weak keyed map making the Class and it's inner GroovyClassLoader reachable.  On a side note, it may also allow us revert to using the Java 7 ClassValue as the default where available.\n\nHowever, based on what I've seen in the heap dumps, I believe even with fixing the ClassInfo/Class hard ref the Introspector's beanInfoCache (Java problem not Groovy) is keeping soft references to the class which I think means that heap will continually fill up to the point of OOME until those are freed.  My thought with this fix (which may be naive) is that in cases where we know the parsed Class is no longer needed we can do some cleanup to assist the GC and prevent filling heap.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/216276923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/216281612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/325#issuecomment-216281612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/325","id":216281612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjI4MTYxMg==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T16:18:53Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T16:18:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"you are very right about the bean cache of course.
