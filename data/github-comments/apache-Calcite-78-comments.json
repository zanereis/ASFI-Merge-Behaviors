That is to say, if `FOO.a` is nullable but `BAR.a` is not nullable, then with the first form we can say that in the output `a` will not be nullable but this is not the case with the second form.\r\n\r\nOne way I could see to work around this would be to improve the [IntersectToDistinctRule](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/8a96095a64bc1cc955438d219d5f1fbcbc5762b7/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/IntersectToDistinctRule.java) by including filtering information when possible. That is, when a column is not nullable in all Intersect branches, we add an `IS NOT NULL` filter to exclude nulls:\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject(a=[$0], b=[$1], c=[$2])\r\n  LogicalFilter(condition=[=($9, 2)])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], agg#0=[COUNT()])\r\n      LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n        LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], agg#0=[COUNT()])\r\n          LogicalFilter(condition=[IS NOT NULL($0)] <-- Filter here excludes NULL columns\r\n            LogicalProject(a=[$0], b=[$1], c=[$2])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, TEMP, FOO]])\r\n        LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], agg#0=[COUNT()])\r\n          LogicalProject(a=[$0], b=[$1], c=[$2])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, TEMP, BAR]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever that might also require additional work because I don't believe that Calcite can use the presence of an IS NOT NULL filter to change the output nullability.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is a problem now is that when the IntersectToDisctinctRule is applied that types of the RelNode going in and RelNode coming out no longer match.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2211519882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2211698532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3844#issuecomment-2211698532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3844","id":2211698532,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM6D09dk","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-06T07:57:22Z","updated_at":"2024-07-06T07:57:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

@snuyanzin, you are right, both `user` and `comm` can contain spaces, I have looked up if any of the other fields could be used in an unambiguous manner as an anchor to understand when `user` is over, unfortunately it doesn't seem to be any.\r\n> \r\n> What I came up with is to move `user` as first field, split by whitespace as before, and stop parsing `user` whenever a purely numeric token is found. For `comm` I am just composing all the tokens counting on the fact that the number of fields is known.\r\n> \r\n> So at the moment we support spaces, but not when one of the tokens is purely numeric like `root 123`. I don't have better ideas, it seems already an improvement over the current implementation which doesn't properly support spaces neither in `user` nor in `comm`.\r\n> \r\n> @caicancai I have added a test, I had to unpack a bit the current implementation to that aim, thanks for the reminder.\r\n> \r\n> Eager to hear your thoughts, thanks for your comments!\r\n\r\nHello, if you don't have further
