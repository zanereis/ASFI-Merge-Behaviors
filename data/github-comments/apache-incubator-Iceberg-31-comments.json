Totally agree. But I am currently in the dilemma where there might be a need to call high-level operations in Flink tasks,  like table.newTransaction() when trying to commit DataFiles accumulated from the streaming inputs. Currently code limits the parallelism to 1 so that the commit won't be performed in parallel.  \r\n\r\nFor now, it is not a blocker because I could pass the namespace and table name by config and call loadTable() of Catalog to build the table when there is a need. But the implementation is not that good as the table informations(like namespace, table name, it is HiveCatalog or HadoopCatalog) passes eveywhere, while some of them are not needed.\r\n\r\nI am also thinking about passing the path as a string (db.table for Hive Catalog while full qualified path for HadoopTables) instead of passing table instance, but the purpose is also to re-build the table instance so as to call some high-level operations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/617074928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/617082172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/856#issuecomment-617082172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/856","id":617082172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzA4MjE3Mg==","user":{"login":"waterlx","id":13976495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTc2NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13976495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx","html_url":"https://github.com/waterlx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waterlx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-21T10:02:17Z","updated_at":"2020-04-21T10:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some progress of Flink Iceberg sink in case you are interested:\r\n1. S3 and AWS SDK are removed, while FileIO is used instead. So https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/issues/872 is closed.\r\n2. The usage of Avro and IndexedRecord is almost removed. The input of sink accepted is Record/GenericRecord within Iceberg; For other inputs, RecordSerializer is supposed to be implemented accordingly.\r\n3. Working on clearing up VTTS and watermark related code. It has something to do with Avro and is the last dependent on Avro.\r\n\r\nPR is updated with basic functions verified, but still not for detailed review yet.

 Thanks for the comments.\r\nI am thinking we will always create a new spec with a new spec id. So the change-based API will first clone an existing spec (either the latest one or another one specified by its spec id). From there, we mutate the cloned one. This will maintain the history of the spec evolution and keep the existing spec immutable. Then, the change based API will be similar to how to handle new spec.\r\nBut this means the existing data will still use the original spec because we never modify that. \r\n\r\nIf we keep the existing spec immutable, \r\n - `addField`, `renameField`, and `removeField` will be straightforward for V1 and V2.\r\n - `replaceField` will be equivalent to `removeField` and then `addField`. One issue is to re-use the same field ID. This should be OK for V1 as V1 always reset the field Ids for a new spec. But for V2, we cannot reuse the same field ID as it has already been used by by a partition field in one or multiple old partition specs. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/619136251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/619146785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/953#issuecomment-619146785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/953","id":619146785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTE0Njc4NQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T17:27:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T17:27:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

This adds quite a bit of logic to get and changes the class argument so that it is a type request -- so the record will convert a value to the requested type. But get is used in a tight loop and we don't want it to do that additional work to not only return a value, but detect what it is supposed to convert to and do that conversion. Also, this changes the contract of a public method and we don't want to make additional guarantees here.\r\n\r\nInstead, the accessors that are build when binding the message to an expression should be used. This happens in Spark, where string values are converted from UTF8String to a CharSequence using a [StringAccessor](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/PartitionKey.java#L260). This should be similar, where a DateAccessor, or TimestampAccessor is used to return the right internal representation from a record that stores LocalDate or OffsetDateTime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/620722327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/620725542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/974#issuecomment-620725542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/974","id":620725542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDcyNTU0Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T16:46:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T16:46:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I run the tests locally, I see that they fail for the current master, but are fixed in the v2-manifests PR, #963.
