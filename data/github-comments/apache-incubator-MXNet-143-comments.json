Could you provide some links to appropriate parts of the `mxnet` docs so that I can check my understanding and confirm that it's correct?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the example below might be able to form the basis of some updated documentation for the use of `MakeLoss`.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit long, but essentially it attempts to train 4 neural networks using `mxnet` via R:\r\n1. Using `LinearRegressionOutput` as a reference\r\n2. Using `MakeLoss` to minimize squared-error\r\n3. Using `MakeLoss` to minimize quartic-error (fourth-power error)\r\n4. Using `MakeLoss` to minimize mean-absolute-error\r\n\r\nEach of the networks are then used for prediction (on both the in-sample training set, and a held-out test set) and their responses assessed using 3 error metrics. As might be hoped for, the networks perform well on the metric they have been trained to minimize.\r\n\r\nThe results (errors have been normalized to the errors of the LRO model):\r\n```\r\n[1] \"Train results:\"\r\n     model.lro model.se.loss model.qe.loss model.mae.loss\r\nrmse         1             1          1.27           1.19\r\nrmqe         1             1          0.91
