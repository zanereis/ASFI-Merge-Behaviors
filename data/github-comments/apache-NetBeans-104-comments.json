The updated implementation prefers the SSHAgent. If that is present, it is directly returned. That might change the situation for windows users, when both a Pagent _and_ an SSHAgent is present.

The reason is, that that the format changed and also new algorithms were introduced. Both not supported by the JSch version we bundled. JSch in its original version was not updated and a fork was created: https://github.com/mwiede/jsch, to which this PR switches.\r\n\r\n> so unit test the \"now broken code path\". Test (with existing or new test) a git fetch via ssh connection type that fails to authentication (and triggers the behavior described) to reproduces the problem before the fix and works after the fix.\r\n\r\nThank you - I know what a test is and how it works. This integration test (it tests interdependent behaviour) would need to setup an SSH server, a git repository and the right keys and then check what you describe. But this would most probably not have caught this issue, as I would have used pre generated keys and this would continue to work. Even freshly generated keys need to have the algorithm selected, which would again yield compatible keys. What is more, you are talking about serious work here, the external SSH server must work on all architectures tests are run and needs to be reliable. We have enough such complex tests, that only cause headaches and lead to people to discarding problems reported by them.\r\n\r\nFeel free to create a test, I won't.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1060244566/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1060271830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3702#issuecomment-1060271830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3702","id":1060271830,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M4_MnbW","user":{"login":"AlohaWebSolutions","id":62156567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTU2NTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62156567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions","html_url":"https://github.com/AlohaWebSolutions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlohaWebSolutions/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T07:30:43Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T07:30:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"not launch any operation except open/close project and save script ( with auto publish on FTP website )...\r\nso, what can i do ?

No, none of the above. It's a straight-forward installation of NB on a single client. \r\nRecently updated to NB13 and the issue does not persist with the newer version, at least for now, I can always return to the previously opened state of files without gaining ones that should not be there as described. \r\n\r\nI have migrated all settings from 12.6 though, as I have done before, switching from 12.4 to 12.5 and later to 12.6, the issue only persisted from 12.5 to 12.6. After first encountering the issue, I cleared my 12.6 installation and reinstalled without migrating, which did not solve the issue, although I have not checked in detail for any remaining files from the previous installation besides the usual user-dir stuff, which should be sufficient to clear previously opened states of files, I assume. (Needless to say, I did not get opened tabs when first opening the new 12.6 installation, but the issue returned shortly after) \r\n\r\nSorry I cannot really supply any way to recreate the issue, as it just appeared with nothing more but plain usage after a while, I am pretty certain that there was no related change to any settings (nb or system-side) prior to it appearing.

This may be useful in the future if we want to explore different build systems or explore some degree of parallelization in builds, for instance.\r\n\r\nAs @junichi11  states, I think it's risky to disable PHP testing if we don't know **exactly** what the dependencies are. Note that there're many types of dependencies we need to take into account: build dependencies, test dependencies, runtime dependencies, etc.\r\n\r\nI prefer to spend time in more unit-testing than
