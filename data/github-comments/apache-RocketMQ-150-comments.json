Moving the serialization operation outside the lock for general messages (messages not related to BCQ and LMQ) is simple, and this is the solution implemented in version 4.x. However, since LMQ and BCQ were introduced after version 5.0, they need to overwrite the queueOffset-related properties during putting message, which caused the current changes. Therefore, for these two types of messages (BCQ and LMQ), when serializing outside the lock, the properties are not written, and properties are serialized  and written after the queueOffset is truly determined in lock. This also makes the append process somewhat complicated. I have done some testing and it is currently running normally. Plz feel free to review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1512585951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1512634921","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/6609#issuecomment-1512634921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6609","id":1512634921,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85aKPop","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-18T08:01:36Z","updated_at":"2023-04-18T08:01:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fujian-zfj
