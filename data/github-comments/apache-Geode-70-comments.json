It will however work in an acceptance test. Take a look at the tests under:\r\n* [geode-assembly/src/acceptanceTest/java/org/apache/geode/serialization/filter/](https://github.com/apache/geode/tree/develop/geode-assembly/src/acceptanceTest/java/org/apache/geode/serialization/filter)\r\n* [geode-assembly/src/acceptanceTest/java/org/apache/geode/logging/](https://github.com/apache/geode/tree/develop/geode-assembly/src/acceptanceTest/java/org/apache/geode/logging)\r\n\r\nAnd (these are older tests so they're probably not quite as good):\r\n* [geode-assembly/src/acceptanceTest/java/org/apache/geode/launchers/](https://github.com/apache/geode/tree/develop/geode-assembly/src/acceptanceTest/java/org/apache/geode/launchers)\r\n\r\nYou can get a reference to the `Process` (to kill it) from `GfshExecution.getProcess()`. `GfshExecution` for that server is returned from `gfshRule.execute(startServerCommand);`\r\n\r\n> @mkevo I might be wrong, but I think it should be possible to get a new server to use the working directory of a shutdown server using the `--dir` option on the `start server` gfsh command. By default, the directory is named after the server, but you should be able to do something like:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> start server --name=server1 --server-port=40401\r\n> \r\n> ***kill the server***\r\n> \r\n> start server --name=server2 --dir=server1 --server-port=40402\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1017942028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1018001967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7261#issuecomment-1018001967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7261","id":1018001967,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV848rXov","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-20T23:01:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T23:01:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 1 alert** when merging 7cb15a3b38ebbe7caf42e4c756ccf2488146138b into 3a36962edfcd30aa3afa3a50813c63bfc155f699 -
