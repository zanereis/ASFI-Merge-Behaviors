Why is it the default? Also - is it `@Internal`?\n</blockquote></details>\n\nUpdated the javadoc with this.\n\nShort version:\n\nThis factory creates record types from the list of getters.\n\nRecord types are represented by `BeamRecordType` which essentially is a `List<Pair<FieldName, Coder>>`. Getters are represented by a `List<FieldValueGetter>`. So the factory creates former from the latter.\n\nNormally you can do this by mapping java types of the getters to coders using `CoderRegistry` or even manual mapping. This is what this factory does.\n\nProblem with SQL is that it uses `java.sq.Types` to describe types of the record. It keeps this information in `BeamRecordSqlType` in addition to field names and coders. And it is referenced across a bunch of SQL classes. To map the `java.sql.Types` to coders we then need a custom mapping, which is done in a SQL-specific implementation of this interface.\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/values/reflect/package-info.java, line 22 at r2](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4204#-L3EYCva7WmOEvE3Cm3S:-L3Eu79-x2YuT282Tsf3:bhjkvuv) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/40c4ff167947ec3addaf9f281ff919e80f97ceb4/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/values/reflect/package-info.java#L22)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, kennknowles (Kenn Knowles) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nIs there a special reason to make a new package? It does mean there might be things that are `public` but are not intended for users. So what we do in that case is mark them `@Internal` and also make a big bold comment that says \"For internal use only. No backwards compatibility guarantees.\" Of if things that are public are what you want and you made stuff package private where appropriate, that's great.\n\nAnd the other thing to do with the package is to set up static analysis with `@DefaultAnnotation(NonNull.class)`\n</blockquote></details>\n\nThe parent `values` package seems to contain mostly value types around `PCollection` with almost no other logic. Adding a ton of reflection and code-generation code there didn't seem right, they would become noise in the `values` package. \n\nHaven't thought about `@Internal` until now, thanks for suggestion. Updated:\n\n* Combined `org.apache.beam.sdk.values.reflect` and `org.apache.beam.sdk.values.reflect.field`;\n* Made everything package-private except:\n  * `RecordTypeFactory` interface. Used in SQL. Marked it as `@Internal`;\n  * `FieldValueGetter` interface. Used by the above factory in SQL. Marked as `@Internal`;\n  * `BeamRecordFactory`.

rangadi (Raghu Angadi) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nThe UnboundedSource interface is somewhat similar to hadoop. split() method passes in 'desiredNumSplits' which is a hint from the runner to the source. The source can try to obey or return any number splits that makes sense for the source. Runner decides how to map those splits into its internal processing parallelism. In that sense does 'maxSourceParallism' directly influence 'desiredNumSplits'?\n\nHow it works in : Streaming applications in Dataflow: Its 'desiredNumSplits' is based on max number of cores the jobs is configured (due to autoscaling, actually number of cores might be fewer). If the source returns more splits than suggested, I think Dataflow tries to run all of the splits in parallel (need to check if there is a limit).\n</blockquote></details>\n\n@rangadi you're right about maxSourceParallism, which is used to set the \"desiredNumSplits\" so the splits are bounded by this number. In samza, this will decide the number of tasks for a job. \n\nWhat I was saying (I think Kenneth meant the same) is that it'll be super nice that BEAM provides an API for the source to split into a default number, like the number of partitions in Kafka. So as a user, he doesn't need to bother finding out the number of each input kafka topic parittions when he runs the job. For LinkedIn, this is very valuable since a Kafka topic might have different partitions in different fabrics, so a default will be very helpful to the users. That's also the behavior in Samza today if the user doesn't provide a customized grouper of partitions: each partition becomes a task (or a split in this case).\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from

for the review. The reason that I want to add the writeIterable method, is that it gives me more control over the actual batch size being written to the database. In my development environment, the records were always written in batches of 1 when using the original write method (even though the default batch size of 1,000 was set), which for Cloud Spanner is a really slow way of writing the data. I have not been able to find any method to control the actual batch size reliably.\r\nWhether the default of 1,000 records per batch would be appropriate specifically for Cloud Spanner, depends on the size of the rows. Cloud Spanner has a maximum commit size of 100MB, which means that the 1,000 limit could be too low for tables with few (and small) columns, while it could be too high for tables with a large number of columns. As Jdbc is a generic standard, I guess it's hard to have one size that really fits them all, although a default of 1,000 sounds reasonable to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359924809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/359925775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4457#issuecomment-359925775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4457","id":359925775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTkyNTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-23T20:50:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T20:50:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It sounds like the original issue is that you were unexpectedly getting bundles of size 1 element which is indeed too small, and definitely has more performance issues than just JDBC batching.
