If we fix it by allowing multi topis/subs, I think it is a break change, what's more, how do users decide whether to automatically create topics(default behavior) with the prefix or to use the

I can change the signature to return a Netty `Future<Void>` and it would keep compatibility but it would keep a dependency on Netty which feels wrong and unnecessary : the callers of `sendMessage` only check the completion of the Future. It's a small change in AoP to return a `CompletableFuture<Void>` and once I did it on my clone, AoP built and tested OK.\r\nSo @Sijie, what do you prefer ?

One way to get more visibility into the Maven build would be to use [Gradle Build Scans for Maven](https://scans.gradle.com/#maven) ([more details](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/#using_build_scans)) to get detailed reports of the build execution. Gradle has tools for Maven as well. It's part of Gradle Enterprise, but the Builds Scans can be used for free when using the public server. It's well suitable for opensource projects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/723799942/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/723808860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8476#issuecomment-723808860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8476","id":723808860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzgwODg2MA==","user":{"login":"Renkai","id":3381789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODE3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3381789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai","html_url":"https://github.com/Renkai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Renkai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-09T07:07:41Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T07:07:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @eolivelli @hangc0276 , I added a file `buildtools/src/main/resources/pulsar/checkstyle-pulsar-broker.xml` for style check.
