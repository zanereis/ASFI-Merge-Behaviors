The biggest change is that it rewrites the HdfsSensor + HdfsSensorFolder (from contrib) sensors into a HdfsFileSensor and a HdfsFolderSensor class, which aim to retain the functionality of the previous classes. The main difference between the two sensors is that the former checks for files, whilst the latter checks for directories. In doing so, the HdfsFolderSensor also provides options for requiring directories to be (non-)empty, which is difficult to do if we were to keep a single HdfsSensor class. Note that this pulls the HdfsFolderSensor into `airflow.hooks`, effectively promoting the sensor from contrib. \r\n\r\nBesides this, the sensor classes now also accept a list of filter functions, which can filter a list of file/directory paths before the final check. This allows users to filter for files with a given minimum size, for example. \r\n\r\nI added a few deprecation utility classes/functions to help keep the re-written classes as backwards compatible as possible. However, if we move this to Airflow 2.0 I would consider removing these shims and simply breaking with the old interface, as adapting DAGs to these new sensors should be fairly straightforward. In that case, I would also argue for removing the `HdfsRegexSensor` class, which is largely superseded by the use of glob patterns in file/directory paths.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/407086888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/407103531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3588#issuecomment-407103531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3588","id":407103531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzEwMzUzMQ==","user":{"login":"tedmiston","id":366688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston","html_url":"https://github.com/tedmiston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-23T15:42:40Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T15:42:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko Any chance you could have a look at this?

Most of the remaining ones are related to variable scoping or shadowing.  If that's all that's left, this shouldn't take too much more work.\r\n- The auto-fix worked pretty well as a base.  It made some mistakes where Jinja and JS are used together which I corrected by hand.\r\n- There are a handful of cases where eslint is trying to parse Jinja as JavaScript:\r\n\t- airflow/www_rbac/templates/airflow/dags.html:46\r\n\t- airflow/www_rbac/templates/airflow/gantt.html:5\r\n\t- airflow/www_rbac/templates/airflow/graph.html:9\r\n\t- airflow/www_rbac/templates/airflow/ti_log.html:35\r\n\t- airflow/www_rbac/templates/airflow/tree.html:3\r\n- I tried using `/* eslint-disable */ ... /* eslint-enable */` for these, but no dice since the errors are parser errors as opposed to linter errors (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/8419).  For the meantime, I've added these files to the .eslintignore, but I'd welcome a better solution if you know of one.  Do you know if it's possible to exclude just some lines of a file from being parsed?\r\n- Side note: There's a weird error being printed when running `npm run lint` which says that eslint is exiting with a non-zero status; however this does not occur when running the same command directly (`./node_modules/.bin/eslint --ignore-path=.eslintignore --ext .js,.html .`).  Any suggestion here would be welcome as well.\r\n- **Finally, this linting covers all JS in `www_rbac`, so there's a decent chance I've accidentally broken something.  If anyone has availability to help test, it would be greatly appreciated.**\r\n\r\n/cc @verdan @bolkedebruin

Persisting DAG is a much bigger problem and would need a more complicated solution( there're a few challenges there e.g. serialize task dependency graph). It would be nice feature tho, since it would enable useful stuff like DAG versioning.\r\n\r\nNote that we will still need to parse the DAG file even it has not changed since we cannot share DAG objects across processes, since not all DAGs are pickable which is the root problem. And there should be no need to actually parse DAG if we have centralized DAG parsing/storage. Finally we will still need a major surgery for `models.py` since it is vastly using the actual DAG and task objects.\r\n\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/408548502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
