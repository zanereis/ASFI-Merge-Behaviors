However I think it might introduce one new corner case:\n1. TI is set as \"SCHEDULED\" and sent to the executor\n2. executor has a failure loading the TI (so the TI never gets set to FAILED or even RUNNING)\n3. I think that TI is orphaned forever? Schedulers will never touch it again because it looks like it has been SCHEDULED. I think Backfill actually handles this situation with the logic that responds to executor events -- only scheduler is vulnerable.\n\nPerhaps some sort of garbage collection is needed for zombie/orphaned

Thanks much for the review!\n\n> I think this should happen at the DagRun level not at the task instance level. (Dag->DagRun Task->TaskInstance)\n\nI don't think it's that bad to check at both places, i.e. I think it is logical to not schedule any new tasks once a DAG is paused, even for existing dagruns. My medium-term vision is something like:\n(note is_paused is in DAG Dependencies not DAGRunDependencies)\n\n```\ndef TaskInstanceDependenciesMet(): # used for schduling new task instances\n  # task-instance specific logic\n  return DAGRunDependenciesMet()\n\ndef DAGRunDependenciesMet(): # used for scheduling new dag runs\n  # logic that checks e.g. if the start date for the dagrun has been met\n  return DAGDependenciesMet()\n\ndef DAGDependenciesMet():\n  return dag.is_paused()\n```\n\n> This is an operational issue. At a minimum I would like to see a \"Pool is full. Please confirm\"\n\nThe way I have it currently is that the UIs (web UI, CLI backfill etc) will throw an error if you don't specify \"force\". The UIs won't prompt you if you are running with \"force\" which I think is acceptable since a user must actively click/add \"force\". I believe backfilling a task ignores the pool at the moment anyways by default so my change just makes starting a task in the the web UI consistent with backfilling. That being said if you feel strongly about this let me know, I think the simpler solution for now would be to just not allow overriding pools.\n\nKind of a tangent but I think the primary use case of pools is to simulate a throttling layer to external services. I can see the usefulness of this in practice and understand that users are depending on this functionality in the wild, but I think the throttling should really be performed in the respective services (separation of concerns, control over what \"quota\" means, ability to throttle from sources other than Airflow, etc), not in Airflow. I think pools should eventually be removed as they add a lot of complexity both to users and in the code. I'm curious what you and others think about this.\n\n> What will happen with the queued instance?\n\nThe executors check if another executor already picked up the instance (i.e. if the TI's state == RUNNING), so double-queueing shouldn't be a problem. The DB state will be consistent too although the previous queueing attempt would be lost since we don't have a concept of a TI state history at the moment. Queuing a task should also be an idempotent operation.\n\n> I have some ideas about this. I think we can go below 1-2s loops on a single core and reducing the amount of queries significantly by having taskinstances update counters in the dagrun. The issue lies in the are_dependencies_met function that does aggregate queries for every task(!).\n\nAgreed, I liked the idea of are_dependencies_met doing aggregate queries using in-process caching and prefetching a whole bunch of data to reduce requests to the DB. For example we could query the task instances for all of the upstream/downstream task instances in the same request. The nice thing is we would have separation of concerns, i.e. accessing the queried data would be done the same way everywhere and we wouldn't need to pass around the DB query results between functions. I haven't thought about this too deeply though the complexity might not be worth

NONE is a newly created TaskInstance, QUEUED is a task that is waiting for a slot in an executor and UP_FOR_RETRY means a task that failed before but needs to be retried. **At the moment the scheduler will not change the state of a Task. This creates the possibility of a race condition: if the executor cannot execute a task quickly enough its state will not be updated and it can get scheduled again.** Due to the loop times being quite large in complex cases, this won't occur too often. As people try to limit scheduler loop times, or just prefer LocalExecutor more than the CeleryExecutor, they will run multiple schedulers at the same time, which increases the chances of this happening.\n> \n> For this reason a \"SCHEDULED\" state is proposed in one of the PRs. This will not fully close the door to this race condition due to the fact that TaskInstance evaluate their own state in case of UP_FOR_RETRY (ie. checking if they should run now). Normally one would move this check to the scheduler was it not for that fact that we have backfills...\n\nBasically, without a SCHEDULED state, the task is given to the executor. If the scheduler loops around fast enough again (or you have multiple schedulers running) before the executor updates the task's state, the scheduler will schedule it _again_, since the task's state hasn't changed (and it's still runnable).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/223488217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/223491258","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1514#issuecomment-223491258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1514","id":223491258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ5MTI1OA==","user":{"login":"plypaul","id":5704934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDQ5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5704934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul","html_url":"https://github.com/plypaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T05:03:07Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T05:03:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I share the same concern as @jlowin.

the new code looks great, thanks for doing this! \n\nHowever I don't understand the last line of your test. The line that's commented about AIRFLOW-131 does make sense to me: you're showing that the ti's XCom still exists even though you ran it. But then the last few lines create a new TI with a new execution date -- when you call `ti.xcom_pull()` for that TI, there shouldn't be an XCom because that TI didn't push one. So I'm not clear on what's being tested.

So I'm not clear on what's being tested. Or maybe I'm confused about the behavior here?\n\nSeeing how I made `xcom_clear` a little less aggressive, I added that last test case to make sure it would be cleared out on the new task run. The fact that it is NOT cleared every time, and seemingly sporadically, seems odd. It smells like a timing issue because of this.\nThe only thing I saw was that I was depending on clock resolution and fidelity of the persisted timestamp for the execution_date, and using \"now\" for both runs, expecting there to be a delta between runs (and as such making them unique). I took one more stab at explicitly setting the `execution_date` to different _days_ to root out that potential case. Hopefully this does it...\n\nI could yank that last test since it is not strictly related to the actual issue at hand if there is still a problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/223947451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/224011464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1574#issuecomment-224011464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1574","id":224011464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDAxMTQ2NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-06T16:27:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-06T16:27:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1574?src=pr) is **67.72%**\n\n> Merging [#1574](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1574?src=pr) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/branch/master?src=pr) will not change coverage\n\n``` diff\n@@             master      #1574   diff @@\n==========================================\n  Files           116        116          \n  Lines          8285       8285          \n  Methods           0          0          \n  Messages          0          0          \n  Branches          0          0          \n==========================================\n  Hits           5611       5611          \n  Misses         2674       2674          \n  Partials          0          0          \n```\n\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).

I understand now. However I think your test might not be testing what you think it is :) When you call `ti.xcom_pull()` without an `execution_date` or `include_prior_dates=True`, it only pulls XComs that have the same execution_date as that TI. Since you never pushed an XCom for that execution_date, you should always return `None` regardless of the clear behavior. It's a good test to have, just not directly related to the bug you're fixing (I think).
