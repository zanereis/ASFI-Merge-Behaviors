Open in Editor for Tools | Templates).\r\n\r\nThe general direction I am using is simple:\r\n\r\n* if a file has the Oracle template I will replace it, regardless. We'll think of the user-facing impact later.\r\n* for templates without an existing Oracle license header, I will not add a license header but exclude it from Rat.\r\n\r\nThe only exception where I would add the license header is category 2 where it is clear the end user does not get to see or edit the template. But we have to prove this for each individual file and it's not really worth the trouble because these templates are simple (not much Intelectual Property, really) and the lack of a license header does not imply Public Domain anyhow (the whole of NetBeans does have a license).\r\n\r\nI don't think it's up to us to teach developers copyright and patent law.\r\n\r\nA lot of developers are really clueless about the legal ramifications and they will dislike a lot seeing Apache license headers in \"their\" code generation pipeline (because, aren't they creating derivative works?

Originally, this task was only downloading from a (NetBeans) binary server (and caching the downloaded stuff in $HOME/.hgexternalcache), but recently, this was enhanced, so that it can download from Maven central as well (or use the .m2 cache). But, the current support, if it downloads from central, it won't cache the data anywhere, so after a clean, it will download the binary again.\r\n\r\nSo, basically, the proposal here is to always cache external binaries needed by NetBeans in $HOME/.hgexternalcache.
