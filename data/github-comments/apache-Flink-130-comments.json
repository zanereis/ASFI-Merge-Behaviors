This is particularly to address the sorters.\nSolution\nWe could create memory allocators inside the batch task corresponding to every input. So every iteration task will have a memory allocator/creator corresponding to each input. It would create an array of memory allocators that are required for the sorters corresponding to each input and when the task keeps looping in an iterative fashion we use the same set of memory segments created by this task.\nWhen we receive a termination event only then we do release the segments created by this task.\nThis would ensure that we do create allocate memory per task and that is used through the life cycle of the iterative task.\nWe change the Merge sorters (CombiningUnilateralSortMerger and UnilateralSortMerger) such that we pass the MemoryAllocator to it. When the sorters start doing the sorting, writing and use large records (if any) we pull in the memory segments allocated in the memory allocator. For iterative tasks, where we release the segments we just need to put back the segments to the memory allocator instead of releasing it back to the memory manager.\nWhen the task receives termination call only then we forcefully close the allocators so that all the created segments are released back to the memory manager.\nSo even if preallocation of memory is set to true I think this would work and we won’t be requesting new segments from the MemoryManager’s pool and instead use the segments that were created initially for the first iteration.\nFor a normal non-iterative tasks we know that the allocators are created for non-iterative tasks. We have a Boolean to indicate if it is an iterative task or not. Based on this flag, in the place where we try to release the segments we can decide if to release it back to the memory manager or put back to the memory allocator only (in case of iterative tasks).\n\nPls note that I was able to fix the failed test cases that @ggevay  pointed out. But I have not updated the PR. I can wait for your feedback and thoughts and then proceed with both the PRs - this and #2510 .\nPoints to note:\nNot sure whether this aligns with Stephan's future vision of memory management.\nImpact on Streaming Iterative tasks\nWill the amount of memory segments needed for this task be dynamically changed? If so the above mechanism cannot work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249105514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249111347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2527#issuecomment-249111347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2527","id":249111347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTExMTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"s1ck","id":318788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck","html_url":"https://github.com/s1ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s1ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T06:13:27Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T06:13:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm not following why specifying the TypeInformation is now required with the change to using Either.

I will update the conversion to your suggested method and also add the `ToNullValue` for the test with absent edge values.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249111510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249113383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2482#issuecomment-249113383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2482","id":249113383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTExMzM4Mw==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T06:30:14Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T06:30:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added a shortcut (rocksdb) for configuring RocksDB state backend and added the dedicated option config `state.backend.rocksdb.checkpointdir`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249113383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249152599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2512#issuecomment-249152599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2512","id":249152599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTE1MjU5OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T10:03:35Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T10:03:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, I like the changes.\n\nConcerning (7) - I think creating the state backend once sounds good.

Otherwise there are much simpler solutions.\n\nIf you do idempotent updates the only thing you have to do is write the data into HBase, and make sure that every update sent for a given checkpoint is acknowledged before it is regarded as complete. If you don't acknowledge them you lose at-least-once guarantees. This scheme does not provide exactly-once _delivery_ guarantees, however at any given point in time the table would be in a state as if the updates were only sent once. This is the same guarantee that we provide for Cassandra.\n\nFor non-idempotent updates the thing gets a lot more difficult.\n\nIf you can fire an entire checkpoint as a single atomic batch you just won the lottery, as you can use the above scheme and a small auxiliary table to track completed checkpoints per sink subtask.\n\nif you can't do that you will have to use system-specific features/guarantees to engineer a solution that provides exactly-once guarantees. Versioning, rollbacks, unique ID's; something that either allows you to revert the table to a clean state or track precisely which updates were applied and sent the remaining updates.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249169486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249171346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2543#issuecomment-249171346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2543","id":249171346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTE3MTM0Ng==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T11:47:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T11:47:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The linked JIRA issue seems to be wrong.\n\nI'm not completely sure whether we want to add this functionality to the `RpcService` or not.

Death watch to monitor liveness, it could register watch, unregister watch, and notify the dead targets. just like deathwatch in akka. Although now I implement it on Akka's dead watch functionality, but interface is defined. It's fine to give another implementation of it in future.\n2. Payload deliver periodically.

did not measure performance against Spark or other implementations yet. Those would reflect the performance of Flink ALS implementation, as there is not much difference between the implicit and explicit implementations.\n\nInstead, we compared the implicit case with the explicit case in the Flink implementation on the same datasets, to make sure the implicit case does not decrease the performance significantly. (Of course, we expected the implicit case to be slower due to the extra precomputation and broadcasting of `Xt * X`.)\n\n```\n        expl  impl\n100     8885   9196\n1000    7879  11282\n10000   8839   9220\n100000  7102  10998\n1000000 7543  10680\n```\n\nThe numbers in the left column indicate the size of the training set (I'm not sure about the measure, but @jfeher can tell about it). The numbers are the training time in milliseconds in the explicit and implicit case respectively. We did the measurements on a small cluster of 3 nodes.\n\nIt seems, there is a large constant overhead, but it's not significantly slower in the implicit case.\nWe could do further, more thorough measurements if needed, but maybe that would be another issue. Benchmarking more and optimizing both the original ALS algorithm and the specific `Xt * X` computation in the implicit case could be a separate PR.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249212481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249212508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2502#issuecomment-249212508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2502","id":249212508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTIxMjUwOA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T14:46:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T14:46:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @fhueske.

Then it should be clearly documented now. that the sink supports only Puts/Deletes. So in future can the sink be updated with new APIs? I don't know the procedure here in case  new APIs have to be added in the sink. Since the sink is not part of the FLINK distro it can be enhanced or modified. Just wanted to know. May be as a first step make things simple\n->Support only Puts/ Delets\n-> You want order to be guaranteed then go with RowMutations.\n-> clearly document what the sink does now.\n-> Pls verify if it is ok to update the sink to support other APIs in future.\nAnyway this will give you atleast-once guarentee. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/249773755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
