a good discussion to have. I'm personally in favor of keeping it simple for now until it becomes more complicated. Refactoring common parts are good, but the extra level of indirection also introduces complexity. As I see it right now, the benefit isn't huge yet (it's only a couple variables that we are tracking).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50203843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50204094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1581#issuecomment-50204094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1581","id":50204094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjA0MDk0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T21:02:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T21:02:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1581:<br>\\- This patch FAILED unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/17196/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50204094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50204159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1520#issuecomment-50204159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1520","id":50204159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjA0MTU5","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T21:03:33Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T21:03:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1520.

If the RDD's lineage chain contains a shuffle stage, we have to perform that entire map-side of the shuffle stage before we can return the first result (e.g. if I call `someRDD.groupByKey().first()`).  The map-side shuffle data should be automatically materialized to disk but I think we'd still pay the cost of re-computing the first partition of the post-shuffle stage when transforming the full

In fact, `first()` is implemented in terms of `take(1)`, which pushes the limit of `1` into the post-shuffle stage, so we probably won't run the full task anyways.  So, I think it's fine to use `first()` here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50206155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50206285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1471#issuecomment-50206285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1471","id":50206285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjA2Mjg1","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T21:22:02Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T21:22:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shivaram what did you think about sleeping longer after each attempt?

If the connection attempt times out, the socket gets closed and from [1] we get a ClosedChannelException. So even if we sleep and call `finishConnect` again, we get back the same exception.\n\nThe right thing to do if the Socket was closed due to a timeout, is to open a new socket and try to connect. The ConnectionManager doesn't have support for that right now and it seems like a much bigger change. Do you think that is something that might be useful to do ?\n\nFWIW, I was able to work around my problems by increasing the number of SYN retries in Linux. (I ran `echo 8 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries`)\n\n[1]
