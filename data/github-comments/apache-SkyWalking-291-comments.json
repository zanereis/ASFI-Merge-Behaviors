If I understand correctly, this is about web app and I don't see why it is related to security? This is the same feature request as https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/pull/430 and even they host all these in their internal data center this still can be a feature. And since @lukenc you already have known how to modify and the changes looks reasonable to me, I suggest you just send a pull request and ask for front end team to review.
