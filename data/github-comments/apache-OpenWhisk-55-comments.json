So using `html` reads `result.html` and turns it into the proper format. The suggestion from Felix makes it possible to disentangle the desired content-type and the property name to project. It could also then make it possible to project more than a top level property: the resource could be specified as a full path (of nested properties). As in: `https://openwhisk.host/experimental/web/ns/p/action.html/a/b/c.`\r\n\r\nOne issue with using \".\" as the separator is that it's also a legal character for action names. So we would mandate that if an extension is present it is a content-type and not an action name. Hence if the action is called `myaction.html` and to turn the response into `text/html` then the resource is `.../myaction.html.html/some-field`.\r\n\r\nImplemented the above, and in addition:\r\n\r\n- [x] pass the http method, path, and headers to the action. (https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1715/commits/888f54af12f412bd33af604139c96a761f99b5a9)\r\n- [x] allow for composed projection.

In this case the Invoker is fine, but its Kafka dependency is not.\r\n\r\nWhat if we keep this idea but instead of marking an invoker unhealthy b/c it's slow in invoking actions, create a priority queue for invokers in the LB pushing the slow invokers to the bottom and invoke actions using the ones in the top ? we might end up with a _best effort QoS invocation logic_ in this way.\r\n\r\nFrom the invoker's health status point of view one idea would be to make it dependent to the components the invoker manages:\r\n* the machine it runs \r\n* the docker service running on that machine\r\n* the containers it executed on that machine and how many resources they use\r\n* etc\r\n\r\nFor cases when Kafka is not working as expected the question is if we wanna flag invokers as _unhealthy_ b/c of that. At that point we might be looking at scaling Kafka, adding more machines to run more invokers, reassigning partitions in Kafka and making it perform as expected. With the QoS based priority queue we could send new traffic to new invokers and wait for the slow ones to either recover or be taken out of service. \r\n\r\n
