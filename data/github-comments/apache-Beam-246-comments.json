for your review @rangadi. \r\n\r\nThe only purpose of this backlog size counting is to enable autoscaling. Kinesis API does not provide any information about the remaining events in the stream so I had to use the CloudWatch service in order to get that info. I've also introduced the allowedRecordLateness parameter in order to limit the autoscaling when events are not that much late. It helped in our case when we observed workers count fluctuations due to temporary events bursts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/322699258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/322737494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3624#issuecomment-322737494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3624","id":322737494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjczNzQ5NA==","user":{"login":"bastiliu","id":7921256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu","html_url":"https://github.com/bastiliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-16T11:07:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T11:07:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kennknowles  Thanks for your review.

They improved and simplified my implementation a lot.\r\n\r\nWriting the javadoc comments, I found two design questions still exist:\r\n\r\n1. Would it be more beneficial to work with `KV<ResourceID, byte[]>` than `KV<String, byte[]>`? The current approach gives users only the filename and disregards full paths or intermediate directories (between `/path/to/input/**` and `/path/to/input/nested/dirs/actualfile.txt`). Full path or at least intermediate directories would help differentiate between files read from different directories with the same filenames. ResourceIds would also allow WholeFileIO to write out to nested directories that mirror the directory structures read from, and reduce the user effort necessary to avoid passing PCollection elements with the same filenames to WholeFileIO.Write, which will currently overwrite each other.\r\n2. `KV<String/ResourceId, byte[]>` works for my use case, but it might make it easier for others if WholeFileIO reads into and writes from some more abstracted `FileWrapper` object. With a `FileWrapper` object, I'm still open to handling an `InputStream` or something rather than `byte[]` as Robert Bradshaw mentioned may be possible in the mailing list conversation, but I don't know how that would work. I imagine `InputStream`s don't serialize well in `Coder`s.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/322917110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/322931449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3724#issuecomment-322931449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3724","id":322931449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjkzMTQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-16T23:58:14Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T23:58:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R:

testing failure of sdk python module blocked the validation of JStorm runner, So I comment out this module in last commit temporarily. After the validation test of JStorm runner, this commit will be reverted.

I would have preferred a single module as I wrote on the ML: in a first implementation before the decision on the ML I thought about having a single maven module and detecting the ES backend version and then basically use` if (version)` where needed.  But there are several points that led to 2 modules:\r\n1. UTests need a real instance (e.g. to properly test split) that is why they use embedded ES, and we cannot have both versions in the same artifact. \r\n2. For ES5 we have to use the test framework that leads to some differences in the tests. \r\n3. split tests are very different as explained above\r\n4. dependencies of the 2 modules are very different\r\n\r\nFrom the user point of view: the same pipeline will run against ES2 and ES5 modulo the change of the io dependency in user pom\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointer on the PTransform guide. I have already seen the `DataStoreIO` but it would break backward compatibility of user pipelines to use `DataStoreV1` class where they previously had `DataStoreIO` class. Besides having `DataStoreV1`  and a future `DataStoreV2` classes implementing the whole IO (as it is actually done in `DataStoreV1`) would lead to a lot of code duplication. That is why I preferred factorizing 90% of the code in ElasticsearchIOCore and only use 4 specialization points (see ElasticsearchRequester interface). If you have a better design that allows no code duplication and a total pipeline code backward compatibility, I'm all ears :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/323115277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/323119302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3724#issuecomment-323119302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3724","id":323119302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzExOTMwMg==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-17T16:07:30Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T16:07:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"retest

Even the pom.xml's for ES2 and ES5 differ only in test-scope dependencies. I believe this means that non-test usage and implementation of ES2 and ES5 can remain the same.\r\n\r\nHow about we have only 1 module implementing ElasticsearchIO using `if(version)` (detecting the version transparently to the user), but have 2 modules `beam-sdks-java-io-elasticsearch-tests-{2,5}` testing it respectively against ES2 and ES5?

I very much like your suggestion of having only `beam-sdks-java-io-elasticsearch-tests-{2,5}`. Thanks! Having only one production module will solve almost all the problems : no more module complexity for the user, no more too wide visibility for core classes, no more (static) requester.
