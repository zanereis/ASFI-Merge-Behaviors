If a user wants to pause a DAG, he/she should be provide a single, conspicuous, intuitive means to pause the DAG. The current solution for that is the \"Pause DAG\" UI control, now found on every DAG-centric UI Page. Setting the slot size to 0 is a hack. Also, it interferes with a lot of best practices around configuration management. Connections, Pools, & Variables are all part of configuration and should ideally be controlled by configuration management tooling (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc...). Manually altering these is hacky. Worse yet, altering them opens the door to forgetting about it and then having to track down why a DAG is not running. \r\n\r\nThis happened to us in production. It was not at all obvious why a DAG stopped running and we needed to follow a process of elimination to figure it out.\r\n\r\nSecondly, what do you expect to happen when the pool size is set to 0? I'd expect to see queued tasks. In 1.7.1.3, which is what we run in production, this does not happen. Instead, there are no state indicators on the DAG or Tree views. This situation falls in the \"why is the DAG not being scheduled\" category, which I hope you agree should be minimized. \r\n\r\nI'd rather have an exception surface when a pool does not exist or to see queued tasks, both of which make it easy to diagnose and resolve an issue. A 0-slot pool is currently a silent error. We could submit a fix in the scheduler for this as well, though when I consider my first point, I'd prefer to disallow silly things like an empty resource pool. \r\n\r\nThe pain of a 0-slot pool outweighs its value IMO.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/269831503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/269853271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1964#issuecomment-269853271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1964","id":269853271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTg1MzI3MQ==","user":{"login":"jhsenjaliya","id":5017402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTc0MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5017402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya","html_url":"https://github.com/jhsenjaliya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhsenjaliya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-31T07:09:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-31T07:09:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"should this go under airflow/contrib/sensors ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/269853271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/269861839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1967#issuecomment-269861839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1967","id":269861839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTg2MTgzOQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-31T11:55:45Z","updated_at":"2016-12-31T11:55:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I understand your points however I think the behaviour changed in master and some people might actually use it.

Ultimately your DAG will stop when concurrent number of DAG runs is reached. Whether the skipping state propagates or not, user action need to be taken for things to move forward.\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to think that people may expect either behavior. People may have designed existing DAGs based on how this feature behaves. I think the main reason I'd prefer the current behavior is that is allows the scheduler to move forward.\r\n\r\nIn either case the branching section in the concepts part of the docs should be more clear about using the trigger rule one_success in the joining task. It should also be clear about how user should expect the `skipped` state to propagate. Thinking about it, the trigger rule `all_success` in a joining task is not logical.
