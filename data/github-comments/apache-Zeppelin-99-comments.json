I can think a possible problem here. For example\n\nLet's say an interpreter X read Entity name 'orange'. And a jdbc interpreter setting is created with alias 'orange'. Then both interpreter X and jdbc interpreter reads the same Entity 'orange', but they might expect different credentials.\n\nSo i think we need some convention for Entity name. Something like\n\n`jdbc.[alias]`. so user can create Entity like 'jdbc.orange', 'jdbc.mysql', 'interpreterx.orange'\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAlso, i think following docs need to be
