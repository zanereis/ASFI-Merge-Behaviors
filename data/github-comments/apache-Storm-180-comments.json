am thinking of the side effects that this change can lead to -\n1. Number of tasks could be more than number of partitions - Acceptable and will be corrected in next refresh\n2. GlobalPartitionMapping may be different for multiple tasks - Depending on when the spout task reads the kafka cluster zookeeper, it is possible that task A reads 15 partitions and task B reads 16 partitions for a topic with total 16 partitions. This can be problematic as it will lead to two tasks assigning same partitions to themselves. It breaks the contract that same partition won't be read by two different tasks.

through the code I think we are keeping track of way too much state.  In some places we cannot help it, but in most places we can probably rely on storm to keep track of the state for us.\n\nFirst of all we probably don't need failed, emittedTuples, nor blacklist.  Just put the information we need in the message id and let storm keep track of it for you.  The Message ID that you pass in never leaves the spout and is never read by storm, except to check if it is null or not, so it become very convenient in implementing a best effort reply cache.\n\n```\npublic class MessageId {\n    private final TopicPartition topicPart;\n    private final long offset;\n    private final long epoc;\n    private final List<Object> values;\n    private int numFails;\n\n   ...\n}\n```\n\nTo implement blacklisting instead of clearing state, and shifting things around, just increment an epoc counter for the entire spout.  Then in the logic for fail (where we do the replay) we would have something like.\n\n```\npublic void fail(Object mid) {\n    MessageId id = (MesageId)mid;\n    id.incNumFails();\n    if (id.getEpoc() == currentEpic.get()) {\n      if (id.getNumFails > CUT_OFF) {\n        markAsDone(id);\n      } else {\n        collector.emit(id.getValues(), id);\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd ack would be similar\n\n```\npublic void ack(Object mid) {\n    MessageId id = (MesageId)mid;\n    if (id.getEpoc() == currentEpic.get()) {\n      markAsDone(id);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/187425242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612644411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5067#issuecomment-2612644411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5067","id":2612644411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2NDQ0MTE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T23:03:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:20:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1100\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1100</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612644411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612649232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5091#issuecomment-2612649232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5091","id":2612649232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2NDkyMzI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-23T01:21:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:22:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user hustfxj commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1139#discussion_r53723573\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1139#discussion_r53723573</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/ui/UIHelpers.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,301 @@<br/>\n    +/**<br/>\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one<br/>\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.

It will cause incorrect stats of emitting tuple of acker, and potential duplicated calling of fail() in spout (it depends on the implementation of spout).</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612647176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612874970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5401#issuecomment-2612874970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5401","id":2612874970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4NzQ5NzA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-23T08:42:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:03:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1133\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1133</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612874970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
