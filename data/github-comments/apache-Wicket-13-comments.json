This is a little confusing, because Wicket implements a whitelist of **origins** and it's not always possible to get those origins, so this is a best-effort method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/666985197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/666991264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/439#issuecomment-666991264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/439","id":666991264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Njk5MTI2NA==","user":{"login":"svenmeier","id":543253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/svenmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T08:01:10Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T08:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for clarifying the whitelist handling.

These headers are not reliable since they are not always present and so the legacy check produces false positives, that is: it will, for instance, reject same-site requests that are legitimate because they might not carry Referer/Origin! Whenever we can determine the origin of a cross-origin request, this check works fine.\r\n\r\n- Fetch Metadata solves this problem by explicitly marking the request as same/cross-origin reliably, even in the absence of Origin/Referer, which makes the new check false postive-free, hence improving the previous check. That is, in scenarios where the legacy check would have rejected a legitimate request (because there was no Origin header), the new check can now approve the request because sec-fetch-site indicates same-origin.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, running both checks serially would produce contradictions. The new check would approve and the legacy would reject. That is: whenever the legacy check makes a decision correctly, both legacy and new will agree on the final decision, but in cases where the legacy check produces a false positive, both legacy and new will contradict each other!\r\n\r\nIn the model you're proposing, if at least one check rejects then the request is fully rejected and so we would be back in the world of false positives that we're trying to get out of.\r\n\r\nIn summary: while having multiple Resource Isolation Policies is a good idea for the future (for implementing specific policies for iframes, for instance), this PR should be seen as improving **only one** of those policies and not as adding an additional one. \r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense, but we would be happy to jump on a call or chat if you'd like to :)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n(tagging @papegaaij for visibility and correctness, since he's very familiar with the legacy check)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/667014819/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/667100509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/439#issuecomment-667100509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/439","id":667100509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzEwMDUwOQ==","user":{"login":"papegaaij","id":191540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTU0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/191540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij","html_url":"https://github.com/papegaaij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T12:42:51Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T12:42:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, I agree.

Since we all agree that the legacy protection is still useful to add support for legacy browsers, I've tried to find the right balance between the new security mechanism we want to provide and the legacy one in Wicket, without introducing breaking changes. I've pushed a new commit, here's a summary of the changes:\r\n\r\n- It adds a new Fetch Metadata Request Cycle Listener that always runs the default resource isolation policy, which protects against all major CSRF attacks and can be extended in the future to add more policies.\r\n- It makes the legacy CSRF Prevention listener implement ResourceIsolationPolicy. This allows us to reuse its logic around whitelisting origins, hosts and providing protection for legacy browsers. This is left as a choice for developers to opt in, if needed.\r\n- It resolves the contradictory decision making trees of both the default and origin-based policies, such that we won't have the contradictions/false positives mentioned in one of my comments above.\r\n- I have gone as far as marking the CSRF Prevention listener as deprecated! I don't know if this is the right decision and would be happy to get some feedback on this. Perhaps by marking it as such we can get developers to migrate to Fetch Metadata as a definitive security protection against CSRF attacks.\r\n\r\nOne possible improvement would be to extract the Origin-based protection entirely into a brand new OriginBasedResourceIsolationPolicy and run that by default too. That could potentially provide the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nI hope this finds the right balance/compromises to keep Wicket users safe while introducing no breaking changes!\r\n\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/667535947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/669064590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/439#issuecomment-669064590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/439","id":669064590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTA2NDU5MA==","user":{"login":"salcho","id":4675359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzUzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4675359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho","html_url":"https://github.com/salcho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salcho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-05T08:41:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T08:41:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks so much for your review @martin-g!\r\n\r\n@papegaaij I believe we're ready for merge now that the changes have been approved :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/669064590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/669745946","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/439#issuecomment-669745946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/439","id":669745946,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTc0NTk0Ng==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T07:02:13Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T07:02:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I've noticed that the code formatting is way off from Wicket standards.

This conflict comes from the fact that @papegaaij's  applications use the current `CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener` not so much as a mitigation against CSRF attacks, but rather as an authorization or ACL component that exposes applications/pages/handlers to a set of whitelisted origins. Unfortunately, this is not what Fetch Metadata was designed for (and @svenmeier correctly points this out), but rather to simply reject cross-site requests to endpoints that aren't meant to be used cross-site, regardless of the source origin.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we can make changes to use Fetch Metadata as both a CSRF protection and an ACL component, but I believe we would be making Wicket a disservice by creating a security module that is: trivially bypassable (send a [CORS-safelisted request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#simple-header) to avoid setting the Origin header, which makes the check undecidable) and very hard to maintain, since the policies would be order-dependent and inter-dependent.\r\n\r\nWe are very happy to contribute to Wicket, but unfortunately we only have a limited number of resources to do so. Having said that, I have a proposal that I think can reconciliate both of these approaches:\r\n\r\n- Revert all changes made to `CsrfPreventionRequestCycleListener`\r\n- Contribute to Wicket with a pure `FetchMetadataRequestCycleListener` that is completely independent from the `Origin` header, providing effective protection against CSRF attacks.\r\n- Allow other listeners to compose this new protection (either by composing the new listener or by picking indvidual resource isolation policies). This way Edmond can have full freedom to integrate Fetch Metadata into his module with all the nuances of his use case.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to provide easy to maintain security mitigations that are effective at keeping users safe in the web platform ([here's an example of this in another Apache project](https://github.com/apache/struts/pull/426)) and I believe this proposal achieves just that.\r\n\r\nWould Wicket developers be interested in seeing something like this?

My application does not use the whitelisting, but others might. Looing at the usage of these whitelists, I think the reason these whitelists exist is not for ACL, but again to prevent false positives. False positives are common with the old implementation and hard to solve.\r\n\r\n> At this point, we can make changes to use Fetch Metadata as both a CSRF protection and an ACL component, but I believe we would be making Wicket a disservice by creating a security module that is: trivially bypassable (send a [CORS-safelisted request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#simple-header) to avoid setting the Origin header, which makes the check undecidable) and very hard to maintain, since the policies would be order-dependent and inter-dependent.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is needed. CSRF protection is meant to do just that, it's not an ACL. However, it must be possible to exclude some requests from this protection. The old implementation allowed this via an `isChecked(IRequestHandler)` method, the new implementation should do the same.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at the PR, and see what I can do to the improve protection, keep the flexibility and prevent the false positives.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/670436058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/670466262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/439#issuecomment-670466262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/439","id":670466262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDQ2NjI2Mg==","user":{"login":"svenmeier","id":543253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/svenmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-07T11:14:16Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T11:14:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we're overdoing it ;)\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation by @salcho was fine, for me the API wasn't just correct any more with all the old references to 'origin'.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest solution I can think of, e.g. renaming some methods and going through a change of responsibility in #checkRequest() is enough:\r\n   https://gist.github.com/svenmeier/e2e29ddad37e453c693004946ab125e7\r\n\r\nI'd deprecate the old listener, and give the new one a fancy new name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/670466262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/670467609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/439#issuecomment-670467609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/439","id":670467609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDQ2NzYwOQ==","user":{"login":"papegaaij","id":191540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTU0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/191540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij","html_url":"https://github.com/papegaaij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-07T11:18:04Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T11:18:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is what I came up with:\r\nhttps://github.com/papegaaij/wicket/commit/c51372bd51e67276d86c8cf02336aa04e2f7a403\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is that a resource isolation policy now has 3 possible outcomes: ALLOWED, DISALLOWED and UNKNOWN.

COEP is a single header only and to quote [https://web.dev/coop-coep/]: \"Use a combination of COOP and COEP HTTP headers to opt a web page into a special cross-origin isolated state.\"\r\nI wonder whether a single listener would be better from the usage perspective.\r\n\r\nHere's our reasoning behind having 2 separate listeners: \r\n* We chose to have two separate listeners for COOP and COEP because they are independent mechanisms that can be deployed separately. Setting COEP headers ensures that a document can only load resources from the same origin, or resources explicitly marked as loadable from another origin. This means that, when COEP is enabled, all the resources loaded from cross-origin need to support CORS and will be blocked if they don't. COOP on the other hand does not require CORS support. It's sufficient to set the COOP response header to process-isolate your document so potential attackers can't access your global object if they were opening a pop-up (preventing XS-leaks). If the application doesn't depend on cross-origin interactions between top-level windows, there should be no observable effect of enabling COOP, while enabling COEP might require some refactoring on the Wicket user's part if they are using cross-origin resources. \r\n\r\nYou're right in pointing out that enabling COOP and COEP together is the best practice for cross-origin isolation. We thought we would give Wicket users more flexibility if they wanted to enable them separately for any reason. \r\n\r\nHaving a single listener for both COOP and COEP would also achieve the same results, if we provide flexible ways to configure the listener. In that case, while we can provide a single configuration, it might be somewhat confusing to have `CoepMode` and `CoopMode` especially since the acronyms COEP and COOP are already fairly confusing! Having separate configs also has less risk of introducing non-backward compatible configs on that object. \r\n\r\nIf you think having a single listener is better from a usability perspective, we can change our implementation to merge COOP and COEP into a single listener and provide two separate config objects and handy constructors for the listener that can receive either `CooepConfiguration` or `CoopConfiguration` or both.

We were just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what the use case is for changing security configurations at runtime. Do you have any cases where a developer would like to change the set of scripts that are allowed to run or the set of endpoints intended to be used cross-origin at runtime? \r\n\r\nWhile I agree that consistency is important, I also think it makes sense to programmatically add listeners that depend on user config. IMHO, the current approach has two downsides:\r\n\r\n- Listeners get added to the stack regardless of user config, adding latency to the processing of each request even if they don't act on the request in any way (in CSP for instance, the `mustProtect` method is called on every request even if `ContentSecurityPolicySettings` is empty).\r\n\r\n- Security configurations are not immutable. This is often the source of vulnerabilities because an attacker can usually force a code path that disables/corrupts security mitigations. Typical examples of this are [reflecting origins in CORS headers at runtime](https://hackerone.com/reports/896093), [bypassing CSP when it's built at runtime with user input](https://portswigger.net/research/bypassing-csp-with-policy-injection) or [creating arbitrary redirects on hosts based on user input](https://hackerone.com/reports/210875). \r\n\r\nPerhaps Wicket has some good reasons why CSP works the way it does currently! If that isn't the case, do you think this could be a good opportunity to improve performance/security? I think having a config-dependent `init` that runs after the user has a chance to configure their app would achieve this! \r\n\r\nWe could keep consistency by moving the adding of the CSP listener to this proposed new `init` too, so that the listener is never added if no CSP has been configured. This would set a nice trend for future listeners.\r\n\r\nThese are principles we've used in other contributions (see Struts' implementation of [COOP](https://github.com/apache/struts/pull/432), [CSP](https://github.com/apache/struts/pull/430) and [Fetch Metadata](https://github.com/apache/struts/pull/426)) and would really like to know if Wicket has use cases where these principles don't apply, so we'd definitely appreciate some feedback!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/679951678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/679958123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/442#issuecomment-679958123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/442","id":679958123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTk1ODEyMw==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-25T11:05:44Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T11:05:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> * Listeners get added to the stack regardless of user config, adding latency to the processing of each request even if they don't act on the request in any way (in CSP for instance, the `mustProtect` method is called on every request even if `ContentSecurityPolicySettings` is empty)\r\n\r\nThis is a good point!
