A few comments:\n1) There is a mixture of the query path and the flow of data in the diagram, but the flow of data is not fully illustrated. If we choose to display both, I think we should include the flow for segment handoff.\n2) The handoff process consists of compacting intermediate segments and creating the final merged segment, uploading the segment to deep storage, writing and entry in the metadata store, having the coordinator pick up info about the segment, having the coordinator assign the segment to historicals via zookeeper, having historicals download the segment, having realtimes notice the segment is now served by historicals, and having realtimes drop the segment.\n3) I don't think this diagram should go into example production configuration as it involves Kafka and Samza/Storm, which are not required to run Druid. I think after I rework the documentation, there will be a more mature place for this diagram.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/88256727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/88257337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1249#issuecomment-88257337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1249","id":88257337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MjU3MzM3","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-31T21:35:41Z","updated_at":"2015-03-31T21:35:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

@cheddar and I discussed this a little bit offline and came to the following conclusion that we think should address everyone's concerns.\n\nThe main issue we are trying to address is the ability to speedup downloading of segments when spinning up new nodes. Currently this can take tens of hours on very large clusters, because network bandwidth cannot be fully utilized, which makes adjustment of replication strategies (e.g. when adding tiers), or replacing all the hardware for an entire cluster (e.g. when AWS decides to reboot your entire cluster for patches) unnecessarily time-consuming.\n\nWe don't want parallelized segment loading to adversely impact query performance at any cost, so we should only allow parallelization of segment loading during the initialization phase.  By default we should leave it single threaded, similar to what we do for segment cache initialization.\nAt query time, we should limit the number of loading threads to 1. In case someone really really wants to sacrifice 1 or 2 processing threads, and use them for loading on a 32 core machine, they should be able to do so, but we won't make that explicitly configurable, requiring overriding the config via extensions instead, to make it clear this is not something we condone.\n\nTo summarize, we should:\n- make parallelization of segment loading during configurable for init phase\n- default to single threaded loading during init phase to preserve the existing behavior\n- have a hard-coded setting for number of loading threads post-initialization, set to 1\n- allow overriding of the hard-coded setting via guice injection overrides.\n\nDoes that sound reasonable to everyone?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/88582114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/88584217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1258#issuecomment-88584217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1258","id":88584217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4NTg0MjE3","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-01T18:21:32Z","updated_at":"2015-04-01T18:21:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One extra thing, on the \"init phase loading\", it likely might make sense to add something that allows you to fire up a historical node as a \"replica\" of some other historical nodes.
