locking feature is configurable now, by default it is off and can be enabled by setting the runtime property `druid.indexer.taskLockboxVersion` to `v2`. \n- `TaskLockbox` in an interface and there are two implementations - `TaskLockboxV1` which is same as the previous `TaskLockbox` and`TaskLockboxV2` does priority based locking. One of them is injected at runtime in `CliOverlord` and `CliPeon` depending on `druid.indexer.taskLockboxVersion`\n- `TaskLockbox` has new method `boolean setTaskLockCriticalState(Task task, Interval interval, TaskLockCriticalState taskLockCriticalState)` meant for upgrading locks in case priority based locking is used. `TaskLockboxV1` always returns `true` for this method.\n- `TaskLock` has two new fields `priority` and `upgraded`. In case of `TaskLockboxV1` the corresponding values are always `0` and `true`. For `TaskLockboxV2` it is depended on the task. \n- Each task calls `setTaskLockCriticalState` before publishing segments. However, in case of `TaskLockboxV1` the method always returns `true` and extra overhead is just an HTTP call to overlord.

error in nested groupBy test is caused by outer query expecting data source to have long value for the metric column created by inner query's longFirst aggregator, but instead got the intermediate

I feel like inner query's result should be finalized by my understanding on how query as datasource should work, but doing so would break aggregators in outer query that depend on intermediate value such as HyperUnique.

To be sure its not a kafka issue, I have tried using\nkafka-console-consumer and I can receive events there.\n\nregards\nSunita\n\nOn Fri, Aug 5, 2016 at 7:35 AM, Himanshu notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> updated the docs.\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3249#issuecomment-237867062, or mute\n> the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ARAoyRcBJ9n4QvVBCCUoH05HJTDWJh38ks5qc0olgaJpZM4JNFH8\n> .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/238331589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/238336746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3335#issuecomment-238336746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3335","id":238336746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODMzNjc0Ng==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T18:45:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T18:45:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just added docs in querying.md clarifying how exceptions should work now.

have an internal PasswordProvider that can take sub-PasswordProviders as parameters...  for example:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\":\"companyPassFetcher\",\n  \"key\": \"s0m3_k34\",\n  \"secret\":{\n
