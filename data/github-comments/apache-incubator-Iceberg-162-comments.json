I believe there is an open PR that can be merged prior to any work discussed here.\r\n\r\n@karuppayya and I spent some time discussing and I personally think @szehon-ho's idea with having an error mode is quite promising. I'd probably have only `error` and `ignore` modes and combine it with other ideas mentioned on this thread. \r\n\r\n- Normalize the path part of URIs to avoid cosmetic differences like extra slashes.\r\n- Introduce `prefix-mismatch-mode` option. Possible values are `error` (default) and `ignore`.\r\n- Expose ways to influence the comparison. For instance, allow passing equivalent schemes.\r\n\r\nI like this approach because it will throw an exception if something suspicious happens and will provide a user ways to resolve conflicts instead of silently taking some action.\r\n\r\nThe actual algorithm can be like this:\r\n\r\n- Build actual file DF\r\n    - Either provided by the user or acquired via listing. If listing, the location must contain a scheme and authority.\r\n- Build reachable file DF via metadata tables\r\n- Transform both actual and reachable DFs so that they contain `scheme`, `authority`, `path` columns.\r\n- Perform LEFT OUTER JOIN on `path` and map partitions.\r\n\r\n```\r\n| actual_scheme | actual_authority | path | valid_scheme | valid_authority | path |\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ns3, bucket1, p0, null, null, null -> orphan (no match for the normalized path)\r\ns3, bucket1, p1, null, null, p1 -> not orphan (null scheme/authority in metadata match any scheme/authority)\r\ns3, bucket1, p2, s3a, bucket1, p2 -> not orphan (must have defaults for equivalent schemes like s3 and s3a)\r\ns3, bucket1, p3, s3a, bucket2, p3 -> error by default and can be either ignored or the user may indicate that bucket1 and bucket2 are different, which will make s3, bucket1, p3 orphan. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, we don't need separate DFs with and without prefix and can have more sophisticated comparison.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1098375342/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1098418166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4528#issuecomment-1098418166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4528","id":1098418166,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85BeIf2","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-13T19:45:32Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T19:45:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI

implement caching as a new FileIO class, CachingHadoopFileIO. A new Tables class, CachingHadoopTables, is also added to assist with testing.\r\n\r\nWe tried to avoid `lazyStats()` call as much as possible by checking the cache first before checking for stream length. This comes with a risk of keeping stale data in memory when the actual file is already deleted, as shown in `CachingHiveTableTest.testMissingMetadataWontCauseHang()`. This is probably fine, given the immutable nature of iceberg metadata.

At some point should measure the commit time perf for large tables.

In my context, I think the approach to fix the bug in fink 1.12 is just porting the patch from flink1.13/1.14 to flink1.12, I usually just export it to a patch file and replace the v1.14 to v1.12 globally.\r\n> \r\n> My understanding is that there is a bug in Flink 1.12 that prevents us from fixing this, but I'm not sure what that is. I think we'll need @kbendick to jump in and give the details.\r\n> \r\n> I agree with you, if we can easily adapt the fix for 1.13 and 1.14, then we should just fix it!\r\n\r\n@rdblue is correct. The patch from https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4364 didn't work with Flink 1.12. The problem still persists. https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4418 did not pass all unit tests and I was not able to resolve them. So I agree with Ryan that it's probably better to disable this one feature instead of continue to allow users to get incorrect results.\r\n\r\nIf they're somehow ok with the results they're getting, they can remain on Iceberg 0.13.1.\r\n\r\nI repushed the branch from https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4418  that originally had the patch for 1.12 . Let me try using `DATE` instead of `TO_DATE` to see if that resolves the issue. Otherwise, I think it's best to continue to disable this one feature in 1.12, given that we'll be removing 1.12 in the next major release anyway.\r\n\r\nBut if we can't get it to work, I don't think we should block the patch release on fixing it given that technically Flink 1.12 is deprecated upstream anyway and we've removed support in Iceberg 0.14.0-SNAPSHOT too.

updated this PR to use `DATE` instead of `TO_DATE`, as we discovered in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4532  that `TO_DATE` was causing tests to process rows out of order during `INSERT

Could anyone help resolve this issue?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, you mean you also tried creating the table through Glue Pyspark and after a subsequent read attempt it failed? \r\n\r\nIf so this seems to indicate an issue in Iceberg, since for Glue pyspark, you'd still be using the spark iceberg dependencies. I was also able to reproduce a similar empty \"folder\" issue through Athena when the table is created with a location where the locations is 1 bucket and 1 nested \"folder\" (in quotes because it's not really a folder). \r\n\r\n```\r\nRoot Location 's3://insert-iceberg-test/f3' \r\n\r\nINSERT PATH\r\ns3://insert-iceberg-test/f3/data/4e23cb0e//f3/id_bucket=6/4e6e49d0-98c2-4440-90de-76c0d7e6a440.gz.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if there are 2 nested folders in the bucket, the insert path is as expected (Missing the extra / separator in the object key)\r\n```\r\nRoot LOCATION\r\ns3://insert-iceberg-test/f1/f2\r\n\r\nINSERT PATH\r\ns3://insert-iceberg-test/f1/f2/data/0eb31aa4/f1/f2/id_bucket=4/febda4a0-2ace-4447-a932-03fbeba36e48.gz.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the end I'm able to query the data since these are keys stored in the manifests, but it does cause issues for external systems which expect some physical layout. \r\n\r\nBut in your case the bucket itself is missing in the path, or is fund_perf_f your bucket?
