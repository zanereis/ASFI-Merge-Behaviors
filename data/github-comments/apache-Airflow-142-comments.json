From my observation, the separation seems to have caused quite a bit of confusion since it was implemented.\r\n\r\nI recall the original intention of separating logging config and airflow config is to provide more tunable configs on the handler level.  However the handler configs actually are not quite flexible in airflow. For example, the way logging currently works in airflow **requires** root logger to set the handler to console/stdout so that [task handler can pick them up](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/task/task_runner/base_task_runner.py#L134-L140). Another reason is that any logging configurations does not allow them to be set via environment variables. Finally, webserver/scheduler logging config also follow a different pattern (use a separate config filepath that can be passed in the terminal when starting the webserver/scheduler). So right now technically we have 3 ways of configuring logging.\r\n\r\nIt would be more useful to move the common configs back to airflow.cfg. We could still potentially keep the airflow_local_settings.py to provide advanced logging config, but warn user that they should  'modify only if they know what they are doing' kinda thing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/393347263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/393349229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3440#issuecomment-393349229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3440","id":393349229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzM0OTIyOQ==","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T23:14:30Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T23:20:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for picking this back up.

Thanks for the review. I still have some issues with fixing the existing tests. Will get to it in the next week. Couples of questions based on your comment though:\r\n1. For this pr, I think we should do the sync_to_db for role only on the webserver side. If we do it on the scheduler side, we need to pull all the models file from FAB into airflow core(cc @mistercrunch ).\r\n2. Do you think we should have db-migration script for FAB related tables?\r\n3. For travis CI, it complains about ``ab_permission_view_role`` table can't be found for the test_views test. This table is from FAB.

I have seen the `Add Permission to Role Error` in the past but haven't gotten to to the bottom of it. My understanding is that the security manager is trying to add many dupes of (perm, view_menu). First db write works but for each dupe it would violate the integrity error and return `None` (and logs the `Creation of Permission View Error` error but doesn't throw an exception), then it attempts to add the pvm to the role (which is None, so it fails with `Add Permission to Role Error`). \r\nFYI, this code is in FAB' security manager class, specifically, in the `add_permissions_view` method:\r\n```\r\n            for permission in base_permissions:\r\n                pv = self.add_permission_view_menu(permission, view_menu)\r\n                role_admin = self.find_role(self.auth_role_admin)\r\n                self.add_permission_role(role_admin, pv)\r\n```\r\nIt's not a blocker or anything, but still worth investigating. I'll try to take some time next week to dig a bit further. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the unit test failure, it's a slightly different issue: `OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: ab_permission_view_role`. I suspect the db session object in the unit test doesn't see the FAB-generated tables exist (since we use scoped session). Although this could be fixed in unit test (I haven't taken too close of a look yet), I am suspecting maybe this is comes down to the way I've set up in app.py:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb = SQLA(app)\r\n...\r\nappbuilder = AppBuilder(app, db.session, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMay make more sense to do:\r\n```\r\nfrom settings import Session\r\nappbuilder = AppBuilder(app,  Session, ...)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/393944187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/393948790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3448#issuecomment-393948790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3448","id":393948790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk0ODc5MA==","user":{"login":"ggeorgiadis","id":6693503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTM1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6693503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis","html_url":"https://github.com/ggeorgiadis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggeorgiadis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T17:19:02Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T17:19:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @r39132.

back to your questions:\r\n\r\n1. if i understood correctly, this would mean that the roles are synced only upon (1) starting the webserver (2) when `airflow sync_perm` is called via cli. Otherwise they stay stale. Is that correct? If so, this may be confusing since the scheduler will sync the DAG file but doesn't sync its custom permissions.\r\n\r\n2. That's a good question! The migration code is currently in `airflow initdb`, which is an idempotent call, but is only used when first setting up airflow.  Perhaps it's more intuitive to add it in `airflow upgradedb` instead (which initdb calls anyways). Alternatively, we can add them as part of the migration script, The reason I initially didn't go down this path was because FAB itself lazily creates the tables when the application starts. This could become problematic in the future if our models diverge from FAB models, so perhaps its something we want to disable... and use db migration only. I think this is another reason to manager security models in airflow core rather than FAB.  cc @mistercrunch , I think this would address your comment:\r\n\r\n> I'm a bit confused as I couldn't find the rbac-related migrations in the repo\r\n\r\n3. As discussed in my previous comment. I'll budget some times next week to investigate into the db session side of things as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/393976438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/393978243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3438#issuecomment-393978243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3438","id":393978243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk3ODI0Mw==","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T18:57:45Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T18:57:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could
