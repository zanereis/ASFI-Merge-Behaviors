However, it requires prediction UDAF to know hyper-parameters (e.g., number of topics, alpha) which were used for training, and it's essentially infeasible. In addition, since users sometimes want to know posterior probabilities and their labels for each of all topics as follows, so single-column-output of UDAF is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n| docid | label | prob |\r\n|:---:|:---:|:---|\r\n|1  |     0      | 0.9957867647115234\r\n|1   |    1     |  0.004213235288476648\r\n|2    |   0    |   0.0014898943734896843\r\n|2     |  1   |    0.9985101056265103\r\n\r\nSee [HERE](https://gist.github.com/takuti/d24324e76d4b2ec7dc4b1d50a4d192d8) for detail.\r\n\r\nOf course, since we do not launch the \"expectation\" step as theory suggests, `prob` is approximated value in some sense.
