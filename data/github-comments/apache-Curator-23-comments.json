This is problematic because it means that when the last piece of work in the queue gets removed then the root path gets removed, and won't get recreated until another piece of work is added. This exposes a race condition in the take() method, whereby if the root node doesn't exist, the take method will never return. This is because it blocks waiting for children to exist in a path that doesn't exist, so the watch never fires.</p>\n\n<p>So, there are two options to fix this I guess:<br/>\n-Make the EnsureContainers stuff have an option of doing the ensure via a persistent node rather than a container node.<br/>\n-Modify the take method so that it can handle the root node disappearing.</p>\n\n<p>I think that it's probably best to fix both. If the root node disappears for some reason currently then the take method() will block forever which isn't ideal. It should instead run a checkExists() watcher to wait for the node to come back again.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604741539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604741846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/830#issuecomment-2604741846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/830","id":2604741846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NDE4NDY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T15:45:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:29:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=behrmann\">behrmann</a>:</i>\n<p>In case you wonder whether the custom decorator in the stack trace has anything to do with it, it's straight call through and doesn't affect the result: </p>\n\n<p>@Override<br/>\npublic T forPath(String path, byte[] data) throws Exception</p>\n{\n    return inner.forPath(path, data);\n}","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604741846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604741858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/830#issuecomment-2604741858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/830","id":2604741858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NDE4NTg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-18T02:20:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:29:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=cammckenzie\">cammckenzie</a>:</i>\n<p>Your assessment seems correct to me.

But I did observe this behavior very often in my clusters. </p>\n\n<p>For example, we have three EC2 instances, i.e., m1, m2, and m3. Each instance runs a zookeeper peer. For some reason, m3 is terminated and a new EC2 instance m4 is provisioned to replace m3. We called zookeeper reconfig() API to update the membership. But unfortunately, from time to time, we observed that one process that used the curator client read the stall data before the replacement (we updated the data after the replacement).  Thus, that process stuck with old data and failed the whole system. Manually restarted the process or used the mechanism I described above to force SharedValue to call readValue() when connection state changed did resolve this issue.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the code. SharedValue only used the watcher to update the value in-memory. That is why I suspected that the watcher may be lost or the session reconnection logic did not handle the watcher properly.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I wonder why SharedValue only used the watcher for value updates. There are always race conditions in a distributed system to lose events or lose the watcher since the watcher is set for each zookeeper API call. For example, if a Zookeeper session expires and a new session could not be established in time, then the events would be lost. Furthermore, if the session handling logic could not re-register the watcher properly, the value update would never happen anymore.  From my own experiences, anything could happen in production. Shouldn't a backup mechanism be used to check the data under certain conditions or make sure that the watcher is re-registered properly after a new session is established?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604742047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604718809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/693#issuecomment-2604718809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/693","id":2604718809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3MTg4MDk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-23T17:23:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:20:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kylar\">kylar</a>:</i>\n<p>We made a change by changing the way we queue zk calls for execution.
