The result would be imports that look like from `airflow.sensors.[sensor] import [Sensor]` and maintaining the deprecated `from airflow.operators import [Sensor]`. \r\n\r\nThe difference is whether we want to treat sensors as a feature separate from operators, regardless that they inherit from an operator.
