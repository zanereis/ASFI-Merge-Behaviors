So assuming smart decisions there, a pre-`ViewFn` cache might not actually have much benefit except in just this rare case where the same PCollection is viewed two ways. I wouldn't characterize it as deduplication, since the two different accesses to the same PCollection could easily have different enough access patterns to violate caching assumptions.\r\n\r\nOut of scope here is that the runner's worker will likely manage a pre-`ViewFn` protocol including caching that is tightly coupled with the runner's private implementation of the materialization and possibly much more complex.\r\n\r\nAnd if this turns out to be a wrong view of the future, I really thing the adaptation code will be quite trivial, ~zero in the scheme of things. Seems worth it for the clarity, though I don't care strongly either way; just a smidge more than style.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/283129593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/283130642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2127#issuecomment-283130642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2127","id":283130642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzEzMDY0Mg==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T18:59:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T18:59:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Generally

State is accessed by both key and window; when an element arrives in a (post-merge) window that is expired, it has no guarantee that any state associated with that window remains, and thus any output it emits has no guarantee of being correct. Dropping it seems like the correct thing to do when this occurs. The GBK in the DirectRunner is just one way of doing so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/283224433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/283227277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2119#issuecomment-283227277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2119","id":283227277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzIyNzI3Nw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T02:35:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T02:35:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
