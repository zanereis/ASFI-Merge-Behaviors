Currently all metrics-related implementations are in `hudi-client-common`. But I want to emit some metrics for `hudi-hadoop-mr` which only depends on `hudi-common`. Moving metrics to `hudi-common` will allow all modules like `hudi-hadoop-mr` or `hudi-hive-sync` to access the metrics-related implementation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/888095491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/888099547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3361#issuecomment-888099547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3361","id":888099547,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4071Lb","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T07:58:57Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T09:11:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"648113e9ca1f1825a773c88ea0431ceba64e69ac\",\n    \"status\" : \"UNKNOWN\",\n    \"url\" : \"TBD\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"648113e9ca1f1825a773c88ea0431ceba64e69ac\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  }, {\n    \"hash\" : \"7988786283d7d473f61c5ba0b573f4919f81210f\",\n    \"status\" : \"FAILURE\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=1217\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"7988786283d7d473f61c5ba0b573f4919f81210f\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 648113e9ca1f1825a773c88ea0431ceba64e69ac UNKNOWN\n* 7988786283d7d473f61c5ba0b573f4919f81210f Azure: [FAILURE](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=1217) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run travis` re-run the last Travis build\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/888099547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/888100829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3356#issuecomment-888100829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3356","id":888100829,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4071fd","user":{"login":"garyli1019","id":23007841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDA3ODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23007841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019","html_url":"https://github.com/garyli1019","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T08:01:03Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T08:01:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jintaoguan I see, this is not a minor change.
