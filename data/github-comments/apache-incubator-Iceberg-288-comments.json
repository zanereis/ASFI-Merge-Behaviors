The reason being, is if we change that the metadataFileLocation path for new metadata files would be different compared to the original location which would have double slash. This difference in where the metadata file gets written may confuse users and also have unintended side effects for external systems. Also I need to step through the code a bit more, but not sure if we always guaranteed at build/write time of the location that the trailing slash would be stripped. In that case we would already be covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1770872534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1770931874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8873#issuecomment-1770931874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8873","id":1770931874,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85pjkai","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-19T12:54:38Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T12:54:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nastra @Fokko for review!

Based on what you talked about, I believe we are doing quite similar things as you mentioned, that we setup a different auth server, and has to reimplement our own internal version of RestSessionCatalog and OAuth2Util so that our Spark/Flink Iceberg users can leverage our internal process to refresh token on the fly.\r\n> \r\n> That being said, I do see the value of separating out the interface of auth away from the interface of resources and define an auth protocol (interface) to allow more degrees of freedom for auth implementation.\r\n\r\nHi @haizhou-zhao - that's interesting that we share somewhat of a similar concern, that is also quite different.\r\n\r\nI think there's two layers of customization here and I would like to note them down just so that we don't lose track of each one:\r\n1. Support for a separate OIDC Authorization Server that is a separate entity from the Rest Catalog Server\r\n2. Support for custom authorization methods that do not follow the OIDC flow\r\n\r\nI think the implementation details of the solutions to the two issues will be quite different as well, where (1) will be resolved through introducing an optional parameter support to override the full path of token endpoint to the already existing OAuth2Util class. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, (2) will require a considerable amount of refactoring to OAuth2Util to create a BaseAuth interface that requires users to implement core auth methods like fetch_token, and break down many of the assumptions RestSessionCatalog is making about the auth mechanism. And I think solving for (2) at scale will be quite challenging - because there's no single spec for how a custom authorization flow would work that we can base our abstractions on.\r\n\r\nI'd like to advocate for this issue to be focused on solving for (1) which is a valid OIDC flow, which is just not supported yet with the Java and Python RestCatalog implementations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1771122573/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1771557957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8868#issuecomment-1771557957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8868","id":1771557957,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85pl9RF","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-19T19:07:24Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T19:07:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not sure I understand this change.

The reason I initially opened this PR was because we observed that when a user attempted to create a table, they got an exception indicating that the table already existed. However, the table did not exist because it had been deleted by another client.

entries.\r\n\r\n@nastra If we worry that longer running jobs all of a sudden might start to fail, we can retain the original policy `expireAfterAccess` , and add a TTL (`expireAfterWrite`) as the upper limit, so that we can give the user an accurate reply.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand it's possible that longer running jobs all of a sudden might start to fail, because the table they are operating

The issue is whether to use the table identifier (catalog, namespace, name) or the table metadata location and therefore whether to register the storage table in the catalog.\r\n\r\nI've come to realize that using the **table identifier** is the only solution that works for all iceberg catalogs because using the table metadata location doesn't work with the REST catalog.\r\n\r\nSo in my opinion we can settle my issue and use the table identifier as the pointer to the storage table.
