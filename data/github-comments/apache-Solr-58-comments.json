Otherwise I don't see how we would end up getting this exception. This isn't the top level path right? The stack trace says this is happening while walking the file tree...\r\n\r\nI think this is very likely a top-level path -- it's \"walking the file tree\", but it just hasn't gotten beyond the top level yet.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases the approach taken by this PR should be fine (i.e. would not lead to partial deletion or other failure). Still, if we can get away with handling this in a stricter way I still think that's preferable. In the unlikely event that some other non-solr process really _is_ deleting stuff, we'd want to know about it; and if we swallow this error, we would have no way of knowing there's a problem.\r\n\r\nI think it's well within our ability to properly order the deletes for all the tracked directories -- the logic was already basically there, it just wasn't working in all cases, and #2349 should fix that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2012621142/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2013499876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2363#issuecomment-2013499876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2363","id":2013499876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM54A5Hk","user":{"login":"aparnasuresh85","id":105652792,"node_id":"U_kgDOBkwiOA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105652792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85","html_url":"https://github.com/aparnasuresh85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aparnasuresh85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-21T19:39:17Z","updated_at":"2024-03-21T19:39:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I'm glad to see the logic that was in V2HttpCall made more common (move to base class) as it should not have been specific to V2.

The behavior we want to see client side is that it gets routed to Solr; don't give up client-side.
