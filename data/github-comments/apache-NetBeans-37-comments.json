Clearly it is related, but I think independent. This (#504) patch is applicable to any Java project, not a specific build technology, and should only affect the behavior of CoS execution. #1123 actually switches what the editor considers to be the authoritative source of dependencies for various purposes. If I understand it correctly, it would be similar to what for example the Maven project type already did when it detects that the Shade plugin is in use: bypass the normal binary → source linkage and just trust the build product instead.\r\n\r\nMuch as I loathe to do so, I wonder if this is important enough to integrate as a user option (off by default). I recall that there used to be some GUI in the global **Options** dialog to select different modes of CoS, but I cannot find it now. There is just the per-project **Compile on Save** checkbox.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/488092349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/488092623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1226#issuecomment-488092623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1226","id":488092623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODA5MjYyMw==","user":{"login":"GeertjanWielenga","id":5061961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjE5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5061961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga","html_url":"https://github.com/GeertjanWielenga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeertjanWielenga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T19:56:11Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T19:56:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Excellent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/488092623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/488104509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/504#issuecomment-488104509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/504","id":488104509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODEwNDUwOQ==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T20:32:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T20:32:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am tempted to try to dive into the CoS logic and see if I can help fix, or at least make reproducible, some of the bugs that occur intermittently in my own workflow.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, if I'm running NetBeans with non-standard CoS logic enabled, it will be hard for me to understand whether certain behaviors apply to the standard NetBeans distro, or whether they are caused by the patch.

For example, if you refer to a nonexistent method in a caller class, save it, then define the method in the API class, then run a test, you will get an error. (Worked around by just going back to the caller and resaving it.) But these should be pretty deterministic. I suspect that the intermittent bugs you are talking about are not bugs in CoS per se, but general bugs in the Java parser, which this patch would not affect except insofar as it may prevent them from breaking CoS execution.\r\n\r\nCertainly if you can track down any of these with reproducible test cases, the NetBeans community would be graceful. I do see obvious bugs in the form of uncaught exceptions from javac from time to time, but historically just reporting the stack trace has not always led to a resolution: the response was often that nothing could be done without a test case. In principle the reaction should be to figure out what critical diagnostic information was missing from the stack trace and improve the code somewhere in that stack to do better next time, whether with a richer exception message, earlier assertions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe same may apply to situations which clearly represent a bug in the product, such as the editor tab displaying an error badge but the editor pane not showing any specific errors. One thing that I have long wished for is a simple UI gesture to tell the IDE to throw out all its Java parser caches for a given source root and start over—sometimes deleting the `var/cache/` directory and restarting NetBeans fixes a problem, but this is rather drastic as it forces everything to be rebuilt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/488512142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/488568841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/504#issuecomment-488568841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/504","id":488568841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODU2ODg0MQ==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-02T06:49:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T06:49:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">

The reason was that, when the ability to use javac from JDK instead of the nb-javac fork was added, the use of javac's APIs that were JDK 9 specific (and were in nb-javac) was way too widespread, and it was simply unfeasible to make the Java support work using javac from JDK 8. So, the Java editing features in NetBeans can run with nb-javac installed on JDK 8+, or using javac from JDK (without nb-javac) on JDK 9+, but not using JDK's javac on JDK 8. But it was desirable that the IDE is able to start, and does not crash too hard when running without nb-javac on JDK 8. One step to achieve that was to inject the WriteableScope (which is in JDK 9, but not in JDK 8, and is used somewhere too hard/early in the Java support in NB, I don't recall where exactly). One thing to note is that this is neither necessary nor done on JDK 9+. So it seemed (and still seems to me) OK to use Unsafe.defineClass. After all, I don't think there is a better way to do that in JDK 8.\r\n\r\nIn any case, using MethodHandles.Lookup.defineClass(byte[]), which is (AFAIK) since 9, feels useless to me.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/490254911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/490280649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1232#issuecomment-490280649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1232","id":490280649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDI4MDY0OQ==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T22:41:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T22:41:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing I was just worried about the change of JavaScript editor but will merge :) Maybe it should be OK because it's the same change as PHP.

First I see it in IntelliJ (I can compare it with NetBeans, because the UI is swing too) and VS Code (Not comparable but a nice feature). What I see is, someone is presenting smth and he has his own mode, dark for example. No one can read it properly, because of the light or the beamer or whatever (Not only the editor, but also the whole IDE, filenames, options, etc.) they switch LaF, hit apply and everything is immediately applied and changed to a new LaF. (maybe with some delay of 200ms or whatever). This is not possible in NetBeans. You can only change the editor theme w/o restart which is good but first it looks weird when the LaF is still the same as before and the contrast (dark/light) is also not nice. So when I switch the LaF I need to restart NetBeans. And NetBeans is not usable up until 30s (more or less, depends on OS, version, Scanner, etc.). So this is really not nice.\r\n\r\nI mean there could be a difference, between, restarting the whole IDE or refreshing the UI. I think a lot of stuff could be handled by refreshing the whole UI which is way better and acceptable. So this is why such a switch is needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/490618523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/490806450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1196#issuecomment-490806450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1196","id":490806450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDgwNjQ1MA==","user":{"login":"rtaneja1","id":32299405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjk5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32299405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1","html_url":"https://github.com/rtaneja1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtaneja1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-09T08:21:01Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T08:21:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can

Makes sense to me, and many thanks for this contribution from Gluon, may there be more!\r\n\r\n@geertjanw, I understand that you are excited seeing new contributor. Actually I am as well. Welcome José. \r\n\r\nThat however doesn't mean that the contribution make sense to me.\r\n\r\n> ... just the application of the [JavaFX Maven archetypes](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-maven-archetypes), \r\n\r\nGood. There is an archetype. \r\n\r\n> via `New Project -> Java with Maven -> Project from Archetype`, \r\n\r\nI see. This is not the most straightforward way to integrate a technology into NetBeans. JavaFX indeed deserves a better wizard!\r\n\r\n> However, the purpose of this PR is to \"bundle the Open JFX NetBeans samples\", so while these two samples are the same anyone could generate via archetypes or via the [OpenJFX samples repository](https://github.com/openjfx/samples/blob/master/IDE/NetBeans/Modular/Maven), the user will get them ready to use from `New Project -> Samples`.\r\n\r\nThere already is \"New Project/Java with Maven/JavaFX Application\" - why don't you rather fix/modify that one to be a nice UI over the archetypes? NetBeans has a nice support for creating wizards over Maven archetypes. I suggest to use it.\r\n\r\n> What's more, these samples are a little bit more integrated with NetBeans (they contain custom nbactions that override `run` and `debug` default actions).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to put those files into the archetypes. Unless I am mistaken @eppleton does that for the DukeScript archetypes. Unacceptable? Even if hidden by a archetype property?\r\n\r\nJosé, please don't let me discourage you. We need Gluon to polish the JavaFX integration in NetBeans. I just want to do it the right \"Maven (UI) way\". I'd like NetBeans to be the _UI for Maven_ - e.g. just a wizard that harnesses Maven and its archetypes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/491357016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/491424316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1242#issuecomment-491424316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1242","id":491424316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTQyNDMxNg==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T20:43:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T20:43:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The binaries should not be checked in to git.
