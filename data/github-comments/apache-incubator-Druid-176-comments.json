I. e. it's just moving Double object from one place to another, no new objects are created.\r\n>\r\n> However, I'm going to replace the current way of storing data in the incremental index as Object[] with some based on ByteBuffers to reduce memory footprint (and finally remove Aggregators, leaving only BufferAggregators that could work in both realtime and historical). When that is done, with the current way of index merging a lot of new objects will need to be created when index merging is started, although no difference for the new index merging structures, presented in this PR.\r\n\r\n@leventov - in this PR you write that it may take several months to complete the series of changes you proposed, but you have also recently written elsewhere that you are \"probably going to stop being involved in [Druid] development soon\". Forgive me for asking, but are you going to be an active contributor long enough to complete this series of contributions and help with follow up? I ask because right now this area of the code is quite stable, and may become less stable as a result of major changes. Improvements are good, but it's always best if the original author is around to fix bugs, help with problems that may arise, comment on why things were done certain ways, and so on.\r\n\r\nFor example one potential bug could be a performance bug -- I have done experiments with replacing all uses of Aggregator with BufferAggregator before, and ran into problems with timeseries queries slowing down and growable aggregators in IncrementalIndex taking more memory than expected (I don't remember the exact details, but IIRC, some aggregator in datasketches has a buffer version that allocates the max upfront but the non-buffer versions can start small). If you are using the same approach I did in those experiments then your approach might run into the same problems. But even if not, that's just one example -- there are other potential bugs that could occur too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365107146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365126739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5383#issuecomment-365126739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5383","id":365126739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTEyNjczOQ==","user":{"login":"raravena80","id":7659560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTk1NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7659560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80","html_url":"https://github.com/raravena80","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raravena80/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T02:00:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T20:01:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Confirmed that we need this somewhere:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.amazonEC2Client.setRegion(RegionUtils.getRegion(\"region-id\"));\r\n// For example\r\nthis.amazonEC2Client.setRegion(RegionUtils.getRegion(\"us-west-1\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps in this file, in the constructor:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/io/druid/indexing/overlord/autoscaling/ec2/EC2AutoScaler.java#L68\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365126739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365152085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5382#issuecomment-365152085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5382","id":365152085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTE1MjA4NQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T05:04:12Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T05:04:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I don't understand why we need to use aws-java-sdk from Hadoop at all.

I'm not sure how the second and the third errors can be fixed (maybe by shading?).\r\n\r\nI understand what @gianm and @b-slim are concerned with. I'm doing further testing to figure out what's the best way.

Forgive me for asking, but are you going to be an active contributor long enough to complete this series of contributions and help with follow up? I ask because right now this area of the code is quite stable, and may become less stable as a result of major changes.\r\n\r\nAmount of work is not so big, I envision that it may take several months because for example it will require to propose some changes to https://github.com/DataSketches/memory, wait them merged (with PR review discussions, etc.), then wait until the library with needed changes is released in Maven central. After that (but not in parallel), do the same in https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap. After that, some PR(s) in Druid. There might be some delays along the way.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why it may take several months *is* that I'm going to reduce my involvement in Druid. But it doesn't take several months of full-time work.\r\n\r\n> Improvements are good, but it's always best if the original author is around to fix bugs, help with problems that may arise, comment on why things were done certain ways, and so on.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely going to be available for such things.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n> For example one potential bug could be a performance bug -- I have done experiments with replacing all uses of Aggregator with BufferAggregator before, and ran into problems with timeseries queries slowing down and growable aggregators in IncrementalIndex taking more memory than expected (I don't remember the exact details, but IIRC, some aggregator in datasketches has a buffer version that allocates the max upfront but the non-buffer versions can start small). If you are using the same approach I did in those experiments then your approach might run into the same problems. But even if not, that's just one example -- there are other potential bugs that could occur too.\r\n\r\nThanks for this notice, I didn't think about this, but I now see that it could be a problem, if all dimensions and metrics are required to be stored in a single inflexible (because of the shared base) ByteBuffer. Possible solution could be to allow certain Object metrics to be stored as separate (not shared, hence resizable) ByteBuffers, and when a metric Object requires a resize, it just abandons the former heap buffer and allocates a new, bigger one and stores the data in it. API may look like\r\n```java\r\ninterface AggregatorFactory {\r\n  /** true return designates that metrics aggregated with this factory need to be stored\r\n      in separate buffers */\r\n  default boolean needsFlexibleAggregate() { return false; }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface BufferAggregator {\r\n  void aggregate(ByteBuffer buf, int position); // this method already exists\r\n\r\n  /** If the aggregated object doesn't fit the given buffer (from pos 0 to capacity),\r\n      this method needs to allocate a new one and return from this method */\r\n  default ByteBuffer aggregateFlexible(ByteBuffer buf) {\r\n    aggregate(buf, 0);\r\n    return buf;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365274611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365290484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5365#issuecomment-365290484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5365","id":365290484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTI5MDQ4NA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T14:54:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T14:54:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pjain1

In some cases this does happen and would be a useful optimization, but I wasn't worrying about it at this point.\r\n\r\n`__time` we can always expect to be sorted, however it's int64 not int32 and I was only looking at int32 compression recently. But for `__time` I'm hoping we can switch the default to one of the strategies from https://imply.io/post/2016/12/07/compressing-longs.html soon. I'd expect both delta and table encoding should work very well on `__time` columns (table for coarse granularities and delta for fine ones).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365787505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/365791017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5363#issuecomment-365791017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5363","id":365791017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTc5MTAxNw==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-15T00:33:05Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T00:33:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dansuzuki does this patch support nested Map types as well?
