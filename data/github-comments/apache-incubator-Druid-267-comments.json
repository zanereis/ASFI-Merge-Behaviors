Does it refers to aggregators that are used only in the context of queries, when querying immutable segments that are cached off-heap? Does it also cover off-heap incremental index roll-up aggregation? If it is the first then it is reasonable to  define an API for external memory allocator, if it is the second then what I am suggesting is more relevant.\r\nNote that Oak is considered as a core contrib and not extension, and is proposed as an efficient alternative for the existing off-heap incremental index. Which brings me back to my previous question - does the current off-heap incremental index considered operational, with reasonable performance?\r\n\r\nI think that by introducing a new writable memory aggregator we avoid backward compatibility issues, do we not?  \r\n\r\n

think two big changes are happening in Druid's indexing service recently. One would be the native parallel indexing and another could be the new Indexer module (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7900). I think this Indexer module would be better than the middleManager in terms of memory management, monitoring, resource scheduling and sharing and hope it would be able to replace the middleManager in the future. It would be nice if we can keep the current behavior for users even with these changes, but I think it wouldn't be easy to keep the current behavior especially with the Indexer.\r\n\r\n> data cleanup could be easy if we follow a hierarchy, e.g the baseTaskDir/supervisor-task-id of the supervisor task can serve as the base path for the intermediary location and MM can just ensure that the base path and any underlying sub-dirs are cleaned up when the supervisor task fails.\r\n\r\nYeah, it would be pretty similar to when using MM as the intermediary data server with respect to intermediary data structure and management. But I think it could be more complex when it comes to the operational stuffs like permission or failure handling. Not only middleManager but the overlord should also be able to remove stale intermediary data because the middleManager could miss the supervisor task failure. The attempt to delete intermediary data could also fail and it would be easier if it's a local disk. I mean, it's still doable with deep storage but it would be a bit more complex.\r\n\r\n> I see MM as very lightweight processes that have the responsiblity of orchestration of peons, monitoring and cleaning any leftover files/data. It would be great if we can keep it that way.\r\n\r\nHmm, the additional functionality would be just serving intermediary data and cleaning up them periodically. Maybe the middleManager would need a bit more memory but it shouldn't be really big. Would you elaborate more about your concern?\r\n\r\nLooking at the code around `AutoScaler` and `Provisioner`, if the overlord can collect the remaining intermediary data on each middleManager, this information could be used for auto scaling. I guess this information could be easily added to existing code base since the overlord is already collecting some data from middleManagers (like host name and port, etc). And since the `AutoScaler` and `Provisioner` are executed in the overlord process, I guess we can easily provide this information to the `Provisioner`. Looks like the implementation wouldn't be not that difficult?\r\n\r\n> Efficiency wise I agree that reading data from deep storage (especially when using s3) would be slower than reading it from another MM, but till now I have seen creation of Druid indexes and final segments to be the major bottleneck instead of data transfer.\r\n\r\nThat sounds interesting. I haven't used Hadoop ingestion much, and I don't know how much data transfer would contribute to the total ingestion performance. Do you have any rough number on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/517516557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/517666987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5013#issuecomment-517666987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5013","id":517666987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzY2Njk4Nw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-02T11:30:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T11:30:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked as stale due to 280 days of inactivity.

I just want to warn you about trying to bring all of that at once - the extent of the change may become unbearable. So even if it incurs more work, it's better to make those changes separately: e. g. first, the transition to `Memory` (in the given subsystem), then - Oak. Doing it in the opposite order may be harder because Oak is already based on `Memory`, despite there is a method [`unsafeByteBufferView`](https://datasketches.github.io/api/memory/snapshot/apidocs/org/apache/datasketches/memory/Memory.html#unsafeByteBufferView-long-int-).\r\n\r\n> Any documentation on how we should configure the cluster to allow it running in off-heap mode?\r\n\r\nNot sure what do you mean by that.

The thoughts guiding me here are:\r\n\r\n- ExtractionFns are generally a nicer API for users writing native queries manually than virtual columns.\r\n- If most users that write queries manually switch to SQL, then the above point doesn't matter, since it's handled by the SQL layer.\r\n- Virtual columns are probably a nicer API for users that write native queries programmatically.\r\n- Getting rid of ExtractionFns on DimensionSpec and DimFilter interfaces would simplify the implementations, which is great. We would need to review to make sure we aren't losing any efficiency (this is a nice test of how good the VirtualColumn interface is).\r\n- Druid users that have already written integrations based on extractionFns are going to have a hard time upgrading to a Druid version that removes them. The feature has been around for a long time and is widely used, so we should give people a generous amount of time to migrate off.\r\n- A compatibility layer could be useful, it would be very user-friendly but complicate the implementation.

Do we need this because it's too hard or complex to guarantee the proper job execution order in the tool?\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate the scenario a bit more. There are many ETL things running (outside of my control) which would produce data in any arbitrary interval . If data interval overlaps from two different ETL jobs then , for the overlapped interval, data produced by later ETL job is \"correct\".\r\n\r\nthe \"tool\" could address it by being intelligent i.e. never submit druid task for a dataset if a druid task for another dataset with overlapping interval already running , wait for that to finish first, if task failed then retry it (if task continues to fail for some unexpected data corruption then that would block the whole pipeline, and also tasks fail for things unrelated such as occassionally druid k8s pods got rescheduled etc). Overall, aside from needing more intelligence in the tool, This limits our ability to parallelize indexing ability of different datasets as in most cases each overlaps with the previous one . This is not a major concern as of now but would become a limitation as load increases.\r\nIn this use case, we never \"append\" , never \"rollup\" as data is already always grouped by ETL jobs upfront.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTOH if I could let segment version be a timestamp token coming from ETL job then tool can run druid tasks for any of the uploaded data set in any order , in parallel or whatever. That makes tool's(and mine as writer of that tool infra) life so much more easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n>  I feel like it's a hacky way to avoid the segment versioning system of Druid which could be hard to use and even dangerous if something happens (like they might see some stale data unexpectedly). Also, it's very weird to me if indexing tasks could generate segments overshadowed by the existing segments. It could be just waste of time and resources I guess.\r\n\r\nall the catches you mentioned are acceptable. For Euphemism, I would call it a \"power user\" option instead of \"hack\" :) , where user understands the consequences.
