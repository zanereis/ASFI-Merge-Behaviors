I planned on updating the upgrade section in the docs to address what to expect.\r\n\r\n(1) By unsettled, the only hard requirement is that Accumulo has full access all of the nodes, specifically that Acuumulo session has or inherits cdrwa ZooKeeper permissions.  While it seems unwise to allow others access I was not sure if we a) explicitly stated that and then b) if we could / should enforce that for 2.1.x - for 3.x, that seems a better place to lock things down if that's how we want to go.  For 2.1.x, the we might want to make suggestions, but not sure how much further we can take it without potentially breaking user code external to Accumulo.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this should not be public API, so maybe its not \"breaking\" but just a way of saying \"hey, you should not have counted on that in the first place\".

For non-beta methods that we expect to be stable, and for which we expect a minimum Guava version to be required, I don't think it's a problem to use the utility that Guava provides.

the testing I went ahead and marked the integration test as SunnyDay but I can take that off if we don't want to make those tests take longer. The test seems to take about 40-45 seconds to test the max frame size against the different Thrift configurations. \r\n\r\nAlso note I added a test for all Thrift types except for SASL as SASL is a giant pain to setup and the main issue was when non blocking server is used which is covered by the tests and corresponds to the type of `ThriftServerType.CUSTOM_HS_HA `(default) and `ThriftServerType.THREADPOOL`. Also a test isn't really necessary anyways when using SSL or SASL as both SSL and SASL just use `ThriftUtil.transportFactory()` to create the transport factory and that utility uses our default factory which sets the length to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and isn't configurable as it doesn't read the max message size property.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1356329348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1356334033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3134#issuecomment-1356334033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3134","id":1356334033,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Q2APR","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-17T17:11:10Z","updated_at":"2022-12-17T17:11:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The changes look good and I did confirm this fixes the frame size error as expected.

I went to backport this to 1.10 and when I did I just noticed that the maxFrameSize option doesn't exist and wasn't added until this PR: https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2533\r\n\r\nSo this doesn't actually apply to 1.10 ....or at least if it is the same bug we can't apply this fix. I'm now wondering if the issue with #3094 is not easily fixable do to this option not being added yet. The answer might simply be to upgrade the version of thrift which supports the option and to a version where we set it which would imply to upgrade to Accumulo 2.1.1 when we release the fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1356818946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1357759120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3134#issuecomment-1357759120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3134","id":1357759120,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Q7cKQ","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-19T14:31:42Z","updated_at":"2022-12-19T14:31:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Catching up on this, so it appears that a new constructor was added to TNonblockingServerSocket that allows us to set the frame size, is that right?
