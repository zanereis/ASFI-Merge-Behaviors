PR does not depend on Jenkins. Perhaps your comment was queued up before the PR was rewritten?  This PR just restores status quo in a totally agnostic way, to unbreak the build.\r\n\r\nThe feature work you propose sounds perfectly reasonable.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion except that all of those things need to be done portably and documented. You should know, since your comment implies otherwise, that there is no propagation of `tempRoot` to `tempLocation` outside `TestDataflowRunner`. We [explicitly set both `tempRoot` and `tempLocation` for the direct runner](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/java/pom.xml#L195), and just don't run this test on other runners, where it would certainly fail for the current configurations. There is also no documentation on `tempRoot` so I'd say that what you've proposed would give it a defined meaning, which is nice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/298488554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/298488962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2814#issuecomment-298488962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2814","id":298488962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ4ODk2Mg==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T03:29:53Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T03:29:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks
