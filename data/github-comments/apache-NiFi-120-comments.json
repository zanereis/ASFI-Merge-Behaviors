I went back & forth in my mind over what made sense here as far as configuring different elements. This PR goes the route of making the framework file the default, and then selectively choosing what goes into the app-log. But I think we have to go the other way. The app-log should be default, and then be selective about which packages we put into the framework log. This is because we processors/controller services/etc. do not just belong to the package \"org.apache.nifi.processors\". We have some that are just in \"org.apache.nifi\", some in \"org.apache.nifi.json\", etc., etc. And users can have their own custom processors, in a package of say \"com.mycompany\" and we don't want that going to the framework log. So we will need the default to remain the app-log and then select specific packages to put into the framework.log file.

I think this is getting closer. It looks like the latest commit puts `org.apache.nifi` into the framework, log, though, which I think is still not what we want, because we have some processors, services, etc. that even are in that package. For example, `GetHTMLElement`, `ModifyHTMLElement`, and `PutHTMLElement` are all in the `org.apache.nifi` package. I think we have to be even more specific. I would look at the `nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework` module and its sub-modules. Especially `nifi-framework-core`, `nifi-framework-core-api`, `nifi-framework-clustering` and pick out any specific packages in those.

Was trying this out. Things seem to work well. There is a bit of an inconsistency, here, though. In order to perform a diff of two flows, I wanted to determine the version numbers of a Flow that I have in registry. So I used the `list-flows` command, got the flow identifier, then used the `list-flow-versions` command to get the version numbers. The `list-flow-versions` command needs the `flowIdentifier` provided but not a `bucketIdentifier`. But then when I attempt to perform the diff, I have to provide a bucket identifier.

Though the `FlowFileSwapManager` is not part of the FlowFile Repository, the default location to write data to is `./flowfile_repository/swap` and I think most users would expect that if encryption is enabled on the FlowFile Repository that any data written to the `swap` directory would also be encrypted. I feel this is a fair assumption, so we will need to be sure that we update the `FileSystemSwapManager` and any related code for that, as well.\r\n\r\nI missed `FlowFileSwapManager` and friends because I didn't look beyond the single package that had all the other FF bits in it.  Thank you for pointing that out and helping me advert a mistake!

Thanks for updating the docs @andrewmlim! I pointed out a handful of notes that I think could be clarified slightly. It may also make sense to point out a few additional notes:\r\n> \r\n> * Parameters cannot be referenced in Reporting Tasks currently, or in Controller-Level Controller Services.\r\n> * While most processor/controller service properties are not validated when referencing variables / using Expression Language, they will be validated (against the substituted value) when using Parameters. This is a nice advantage of Parameters over variables.\r\n> * Variable values cannot reference other variables or make use of Expression Language.\r\n> * It may be worth explaining how variables work when interacting with the Flow Registry. When exporting a flow to the flow registry, the name of the parameter context is sent for each process group that is stored. Additionally, the parameters (names, descriptions, values, whether or not sensitive) are stored with the flow (for sensitive params, the values are not stored). When a flow is imported / updated, if no parameter context is already set, NiFi will set the Parameter Context with the same name as the one stored in flow registry. If none exists with that name, it will create one. It will also add in values for any missing parameters, based on the values that were exported to the flow registry. Even though sensitive values are not stored in the flow registry, this is a huge improvement over variables, because of Parameters are used, it's very easy for the user, on import/upgrade, to just go in and define the values for the Parameters, including sensitive values. If using Variables, users had to search for sensitive properties to fill in the values, etc. And since all properties in the flow can now be parameterized, it is now easy, when designing the flow, to parameterize things that will change per-deployment, and then have just one place to fill in all of these values when importing the flow.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments @markap14 ! I'll edit my PR with these Notes. For the last bullet re: Flow Registry integration, I agree we need to cover this topic in more depth, however I was planning on doing that in a separate Jira/PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/531266412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/531269936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3667#issuecomment-531269936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3667","id":531269936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTI2OTkzNg==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T14:54:51Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T14:54:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @bbende all looks good. +1 merged to master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/531269936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/531271643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3715#issuecomment-531271643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3715","id":531271643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTI3MTY0Mw==","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T14:58:54Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T15:00:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To test this PR:\r\n\r\nWith embedded zookeeper:\r\n- nifi.zookeeper.connect.string=localhost:2181\r\n- nifi.state.management.embedded.zookeeper.start=true\r\n- zookeeper.properties file:\r\n    -

This capability is important and is something that many folks have requested. The proposed solution will perform an unbounded number of requests in order to clear all nested queues.

The clear queue action is an asynchronous request that the UI polls while the action completes.  When the action encompasses multiple queues we should be able to provide this context with the same asynchronous request/response model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/531830167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/531853461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3732#issuecomment-531853461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3732","id":531853461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTg1MzQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-16T16:27:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T16:27:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pvillard31 given you reviewed the PutKudu changes from a NiFi perspective, would you be interested in reviewing this one too?

So you suggest to move the empty multiple queues logic from the front-end to the back-end side by adding one or more rest api to the exsisting endpoints. We may have cases where the user wants to empty different selected process groups at once, or different selected queues at once, so I would suggest to add two rest api to the \"FlowFile Queues\" endpoint: the first one should accept a list of process group IDs in order to empty the queues inside them(recursively or not); the second one should accept a list of connections IDs to empty. We may collect all IDs into a json body.\r\n\r\nThis way we can efficiently cover all cases where the user wants to:\r\n\r\n- empty the selected queue\r\n- empty the selected queues\r\n- empty the selected process group (recursively or not)\r\n- empty the selected process groups (recursively or not)\r\n- empty the current process group (recursively or not)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about?\r\n\r\n@adarmiento you stated:\r\n\r\n> I think that the most useful features are:\r\n> \r\n>> selected queue: empty the selected queue\r\n>> selected queues: empty the selected queues\r\n>> current process group (recursive): empty all queues inside the current process group recursively\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to empty only a subset of the flow I'm currently viewing? In that case features like \"empty the selected process group\" or \"empty the selected process groups\" are necessary, do you agree?\r\n\r\nHowever, as mentioned by @adarmiento\r\n> Are there use cases in which you are interested into emptying all queue of a processor group which is not the current one AND at the same time we do not want to delete the queue recursively?\r\n\r\nI have doubts about the usefulness of the non recursive actions. Are there use cases where we do not really need to empty a process group recursively? Do you guys @mcgilman @adarmiento suggest to add the non recursive actions or postpone them to another pr?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/532601047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/532613745","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3700#issuecomment-532613745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3700","id":532613745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjYxMzc0NQ==","user":{"login":"adarmiento","id":13642937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQyOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13642937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento","html_url":"https://github.com/adarmiento","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T09:57:40Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T09:57:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd say that to empty a subset of the flow I am currently viewing, I'd go for the \"selected queues: empty the selected queues\", however, I understand your urge to add more convenience methods.\r\nI'd say I would add all the non-core feature in 1+ separate PRs, keeping this \"core\" implementation as simple as possible. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/532613745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/532672648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3643#issuecomment-532672648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3643","id":532672648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjY3MjY0OA==","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T12:59:21Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T12:59:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@belugabehr \r\nUnfortunately I can't do much about the failed CI jobs.
