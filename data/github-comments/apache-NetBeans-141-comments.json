There is actually another pending PR #5091 which fixes a few things there. E.g it adds the JDK to the path and fixes parsing for stack traces with module names in them.\r\n\r\nI mostly got annoyed by NB not linking traces in tests (ant project did that if i remember correctly). Initially I only wanted to enable it in selected mojos, but I couldn't see a reason to not enable it everywhere. A stacktrace is a stacktrace. It does lose it's classloader information once its logged. The IDE can only resolve those links on a best-effort basis. Links leading into JDK or program code will be correct most of the time, but they don't have to be.

Specifically, if we try to add the same feature for implicitly type lambda parameters, it will be hard to put the types at the end of the line. Ultimately, `var` will be the an outlier in how other similar things will be handled. (And, overall, we may need to add more stuff at the end of lines - debugging info comes to mind.)\r\n\r\n@jlahoda that depends a little whether you consider if it's conceptually the `var` type that should be hinted, or the return type of methods where it's chained or not assigned to the same explicit type. eg. could consider hinting where assignment is to a super type as well as `var`?\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm not sure completely inline hints scale anyway.  Some users get confused by non-editable text appearing in amongst their text, and they affect formatting of code (eg. by default we show a right margin guide, which becomes less useful the more hints there are).  Whereas there's at least more space at line ends to show information in a potentially less confusing way?  Or we could consider vertical space instead?\r\n\r\nI have less concerns where hints are not enabled by default though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1356770439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1356783096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4485#issuecomment-1356783096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4485","id":1356783096,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Q3t34","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-18T12:01:20Z","updated_at":"2022-12-18T12:01:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Chris2011 something went wrong here.

sometimes there is a difference between operating correctly and as expected.\r\n\r\nBit of history why Maven Local artifacts is resolved to Maven projects: The only way Maven could share code between projects was through local repository, even if the project were in the same project tree in source control. That was the case until Maven 3 came out. That also created the belief that the source and the artifacts in Maven Local are the \"same\". Probably the most common way maven build is executed today is using `mvn install` (even NetBeans does that), instead of `mvn package`, which would be enough.\r\n\r\nThe interoperability between Maven and Gradle projects were never an important issue as people either use Maven or Gradle for one project usually not both of them. When they do that. They share released artifacts, not live code.\r\n\r\nI can assure you that the Gradle integration was created with the attention of NetBeans Project integration, and many parts were made after how the Maven integration were done.\r\n\r\n> My expectation is that the experience developing java projects with NetBeans is not dependent on project's underlying build system (as much as possible). I expect the default behavior of projects to be the same and that the different project types, for the same language, interact seamlessly.\r\n\r\nI would say that's a kind of utopia, probably a very few people chased / cared about that one. I'd say the build system defines the project, not the language. There could be similarities, after all, we would like to see the sources get compiled and packaged at the end, but that's it.\r\n\r\nJust check the Ant and Maven integration. You might end up with a similar situation like with Gradle. You would  need to a library produced with Ant consumable from maven, so you would add some task which publish the artifact created with Ant into Maven Local repo. The IDE would not be able to trace back the artifact in the repo into the Ant project sources. Though if you'd provide both binary and source artifacts from Ant, then the provided source jar would be opened on `GoToDeclaration` action.\r\n\r\nAs of breakpoints, nothing prevents you to place a breakpoint into the readonly sources opened by the `GoToDeclaration` action.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of NetBeans that Maven, Gradle and Ant as build tools are first class citizens. You can open those project as they are, no extra setup / preparation needed. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1362282694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1363182797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5115#issuecomment-1363182797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5115","id":1363182797,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5RQITN","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-22T17:55:32Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T17:55:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lbownik I did not want to really put out on the public mailing list.

Last summer I wanted to update my biggest project's build system from ant and I selected Gradle (I can't stomach xml as a programming language); I'm still a novice but I'm happy with the results (even published a Gradle plugin to assist when using NetBeans' standalone lookup library).\r\n\r\nI decided to package some things into a library for use in various projects; the lib is used by both Maven and Gradle projects. When working with a developing library, there is **mixed Gradle/Maven development**; _it's unavoidable_. Editing, breakpoints and refactoring between projects is needed.\r\n\r\n> I can assure you that the Gradle integration was created with the attention of NetBeans Project integration, and many parts were made after how the Maven integration were done.\r\n\r\nI didn't think carefully enough about \"project\", apologies. I didn't mean the user facing project view; I meant an underlying/nb-internal Java project API, presumably built around the scanner and it's results (something that provided interoperability) but I guess such an API doesn't exist. Too bad such an API wasn't formalized when Maven support was added.\r\n\r\n> > My expectation is that the experience developing java projects with NetBeans is not dependent on project's underlying build system (as much as possible). I expect the default behavior of projects to be the same and that the different project types, for the same language, interact seamlessly.\r\n\r\n> I would say that's a kind of utopia, probably a very few people chased / cared about that one. I'd say the build system defines the project, not the language. There could be similarities, after all, we would like to see the sources get compiled and packaged at the end, but that's it.\r\n\r\nBy \"the experience developing java projects with NetBeans\" I mean `editing`, `debugging`, `refactoring` source code between open projects, independent of build system. I do not mean build script or other things outside of NetBeans. The expectations are about working with Java source within NetBeans; not hopes for some utopian unified view of building.\r\n\r\nAnt is essentially deprecated; it feels like both Maven and Gradle will be around and active for a long time. When working with source code within NetBeans, the underlying build system should not have a bearing. If behavior is different, _these problems will only become be more obvious_.\r\n\r\n> The beauty of NetBeans that Maven, Gradle and Ant as build tools are first class citizens. You can open those project as they are, no extra setup / preparation needed.\r\n\r\nI agree wholeheartedly.

I do not mean build script or other things outside of NetBeans. The expectations are about working with Java source within NetBeans; not hopes for some utopian unified view of building.\r\n\r\nIt is. Projects provide classpath to the java files in the editor and source -> binary, binary -> source mappings. Your issue here is that the Gradle project does not provide a Maven Local repository -> Gradle source mapping.\r\n\r\nIs that good or is that bad? That could be viewed from different angles. For me it seems to be correct as publishMavenLocal means a release, and from that point whatever is published is independent from it source. From your point of view, you would like to get \"IDE time binding between the two\". That's why @neilcsmith-net mentioned, that there could be an option/switch for that.\r\n\r\nYou could actually get the Go to declaration/refactoring/etc working if you can convince Maven to use the jar directly produced by the Gradle project (in it's build/libs dir). It could be done by providing that jar system scoped with it's path (that scope is deprecated by now, but still could work). Unfortunately it is hard to convince Maven to do anything the other way it is doing by default. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, why would you develop in that mixed project style? It's like asking for problems. What I'd do right now is to convert the Maven project into a Gradle project and use the includeBuild functionality of Gradle. That one is just designed for your exact use case. \r\n\r\nYou can even leave the pom.xml in place for a while for those who likes Maven.\r\n\r\nSo sum this up:\r\n * There could be a switch which would let MavenLocal artifacts associated with Gradle project\r\n * Convert the Maven build to Gradle\r\n   Upon that there could be a desirable Gradle plugin feature, which would convert Maven projects to Gradle.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1363609927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1363979981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4700#issuecomment-1363979981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4700","id":1363979981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5RTK7N","user":{"login":"spyhunter99","id":1975321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzUzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99","html_url":"https://github.com/spyhunter99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spyhunter99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-23T14:05:14Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T16:13:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i get similar issues with profiling with nb15 against a jdk8 app, just crashes the jvm instantly.
