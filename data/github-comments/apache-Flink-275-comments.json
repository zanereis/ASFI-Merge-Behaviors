Thanks for iterating on this so quickly! I will do a last thorough review next week and then hopefully merge.\r\n\r\nTo make the reviewing easier you could restructure the commits a bit. All prerequisite work should go into isolated commits and then the last commit should only have the new files for the Kafka 2.0 connector. For example the dependency change would be separate, or renaming the `KafkaTableSource` to `KafkaTableSourceBase` can be separate to more clearly see what each change does. This makes it way easier in the feature when someone looks at the changes and tries to figure out what was going on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/429374391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/429376594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6703#issuecomment-429376594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6703","id":429376594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTM3NjU5NA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T16:04:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T16:04:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha
