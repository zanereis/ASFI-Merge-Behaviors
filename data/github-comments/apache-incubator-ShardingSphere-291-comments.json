However as @AnushkaSingh1 comes first, I just assigned this issue to her. \r\nIf you would like to work on similar issues, you can find more [here](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22project%3A+OpenForce+2022%22+++label%3A%22in%3A+SQL+parse%22+no%3Aassignee+) about PostgreSQL, which haven't been assigned yet. Let me know if you're interested in Oracle specific SQLs, I can open another issue for you:) \r\n\r\nYou can learn more about ANTLR in their official doc [here](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md) and see some already implemented grammar [here](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/tree/c27bfea1a989d36055fe81c4da5fd37a0e40d526/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-dialect/shardingsphere-sql-parser-oracle/src/main/antlr4/imports/oracle) as examples.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1065092241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1065099306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15746#issuecomment-1065099306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15746","id":1065099306,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M4_fCAq","user":{"login":"pk-218","id":53428217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDI4MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53428217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218","html_url":"https://github.com/pk-218","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pk-218/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T13:10:06Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T13:10:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @tuichenchuxin!
