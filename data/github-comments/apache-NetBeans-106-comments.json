Then it can be copied, modified and filtered with the provided methods.\r\n\r\nHowever you've got me thinking. As it all started with ```--configuration-cache``` could be globally enabled. That flag is used maybe 3 times in the code and can be checked the GradleVersion on those spots to add that flag or clear that. So for that problem this implementation is an overkill. I've got carried away as the GradleCommandLine has already have a getSupportedCommandLine() method and I thought it would be fun, if that would understand the target GradleVersion as well.\r\n\r\n@sdedic @JaroslavTulach do you see value in this PR for the future?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1075330631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1075584342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3836#issuecomment-1075584342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3836","id":1075584342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5AHB1W","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-22T20:01:14Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T20:01:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This fixes encoding problems for maven execution introduced by JEP 400.

Keeping unreliable tests in the shared CI pool undermines the main purpose - it only annoys others as they are being punished by your own incapability to stabilize your tests.\r\n\r\nSet a private job (like [vscode did](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Netbeans/job/netbeans-vscode/) with `java/java.lsp.server` tests) to run your tests including `@RandomlyFails` ones. Execute often and perform stabilization of your code & tests there until the code is stable. Meanwhile just annotate **every** randomly failing test in pre-commit CI as `@RandomlyFails` ones.\r\n\r\nI fully understand why engineers don't want to disable tests, but consider the harm caused by keeping annoying randomly failing tests in the shared CI pool. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1077385798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
