, I looked into the test cases for tvmc (https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/python/unittest/test_target_codegen_c_host.py#L36) and found that all the cases export their module as library and then load the module, before actually run the module, like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nmhost = tvm.build(s, [A, B, C], \"c\", name=\"test_fadd\")\r\n**mhost.export_library(path_dso)\r\nm = tvm.runtime.load_module(path_dso)**\r\nfadd = m[\"test_fadd\"]\r\nfadd(a, b, c)\r\n</pre> \r\n\r\nMy question is, is this a desired behavior, rather than a bug that tvmc does not support to run a module directly?\r\n<pre>\r\n# Following code pattern is not desired in tvmc?\r\nf = tvm.build(s, [A, B, D, bias], \"c\")\r\nf(a, b, d,

I'll spend some time to fix them.\r\nLater we can add ARM results to TLCBench or write a blog for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/797174452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/797176693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7645#issuecomment-797176693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7645","id":797176693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NzE3NjY5Mw==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-12T01:49:49Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T01:49:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes that sounds correct, can you send a PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/797176693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/797178335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7299#issuecomment-797178335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7299","id":797178335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NzE3ODMzNQ==","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-12T01:54:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T01:54:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @apeskov, @FrozenGene, @leandron, and @echuraev.
