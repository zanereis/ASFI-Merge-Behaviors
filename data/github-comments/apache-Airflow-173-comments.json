NoneType\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat None result is annoying even the scheduler :)\r\n\r\nEDIT: quoting the documentation for expected behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn the example above, if the DAG is picked up by the scheduler daemon on 2016-01-02 at 6 AM, (or from the command line), a single DAG Run will be created, with an execution_date of 2016-01-01, and the next one will be created just after midnight on the morning of 2016-01-03 with an execution date of 2016-01-02.\r\n\r\nIf the dag.catchup value had been True instead, the scheduler would have created a DAG Run for each completed interval between 2015-12-01 and 2016-01-02 (but not yet one for 2016-01-02, as that interval hasn’t completed) and the scheduler will execute them sequentially. This behavior is great for atomic datasets that can easily be split into periods. Turning catchup off is great if your DAG Runs perform backfill internally.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/436295821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/436298904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2460#issuecomment-436298904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2460","id":436298904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjI5ODkwNA==","user":{"login":"ultrabug","id":474389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDM4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/474389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug","html_url":"https://github.com/ultrabug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultrabug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T15:43:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T15:43:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To

The change made in that PR is partially meant to address a breaking change in Python package `docker==3.0.0`. But I missed to pin the `docker` version in that commit. This may result in issues for users who have `docker < 3.0.0` when they upgrade to
