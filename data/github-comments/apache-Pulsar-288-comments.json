If curent ledger is closed(we shut down the service) or full a new ledger will be created and become the current ledger. There's a caveat that ledger trimming is performed on ledger level, e.g. it removes a whole ledger, and it **won't touch current ledger.** So in your case even if ledger retention is set to 10M and ledger size has exceeded, but it's the current ledger so it won't be removed. I think if you set `managedLedgerMaxSizePerLedgerMbytes` to lower value and produce messages to make topic write to a new ledger or just simplelu stop the service and start again and check stats again to activate the topic, you can observe the old ledger being deleted due to exceeded retention size limit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/767744226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/767772635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9308#issuecomment-767772635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9308","id":767772635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2Nzc3MjYzNQ==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-26T19:25:35Z","updated_at":"2021-01-26T19:25:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot

tested in my local environment, it works well. Here're my detail steps:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the latest pulsar repository.\r\n2. Change `SampleConsumer.cc` and `SampleProducer.cc` under `pulsar-client-cpp/examples` to\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// SampleProducer.cc (ignore the license header...)\r\n#include <pulsar/Client.h>\r\n#include <lib/LogUtils.h>\r\n\r\nDECLARE_LOG_OBJECT()\r\nusing namespace pulsar;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    Client client(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\");\r\n    Producer producer;\r\n    Result result = client.createProducer(\"xyz-topic\", producer);\r\n    if (result != ResultOk) {\r\n        LOG_ERROR(\"Error creating producer: \" << result);\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Send synchronously\r\n    const std::string key = \"my-key\";\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\r\n        const auto msg = MessageBuilder().setContent(\"msg-\" + std::to_string(i)).setPartitionKey(key).build();\r\n        MessageId id;\r\n        result = producer.send(msg, id);\r\n        if (result == ResultOk) {\r\n            LOG_INFO(\"Send \" << msg << \" to \" << id);\r\n        } else {\r\n            LOG_ERROR(\"Failed to send \" << msg << \": \" << result);\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    client.close();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <pulsar/Client.h>\r\n#include <lib/LogUtils.h>\r\n\r\nDECLARE_LOG_OBJECT()\r\nusing namespace pulsar;\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\r\n    const std::string subName = (argc > 1) ? argv[1] : \"my-sub\";\r\n    Client client(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\");\r\n    Consumer consumer;\r\n    ConsumerConfiguration conf;\r\n    conf.setReadCompacted(true);\r\n    conf.setSubscriptionInitialPosition(InitialPositionEarliest);\r\n    Result result = client.subscribe(\"xyz-topic\", subName, conf, consumer);\r\n    if (result != ResultOk) {\r\n        LOG_ERROR(\"Failed to subscribe: \" << result);\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Message msg;\r\n    while (true) {\r\n        Result result = consumer.receive(msg, 1000);\r\n        if (result == ResultTimeout) {\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        if (result != ResultOk) {\r\n            LOG_ERROR(\"Failed to receive: \" << result);\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n        LOG_INFO(\"Receive: \" << msg.getPartitionKey() << \" => \" << msg.getDataAsString() << \" from \"\r\n                             << msg.getMessageId());\r\n        consumer.acknowledge(msg);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    client.close();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `SampleProducer` send 10 messages (`msg-0` to `msg-9`) with the same key `my-key` to topic `xyz-topic`. And the `SampleConsumer` try to consume all messages from the initial position.\r\n\r\n3. Build the pulsar using `mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pcore-modules`.\r\n4. Run a test standalone service by running `pulsar-client-cpp/pulsar-test-service-start.sh`.\r\n5. Build the C++ client using `cmake`.\r\n6. Run `./examples/SampleProducer`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.153 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=0, publish_time=1611735688045, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,0,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.158 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=1, publish_time=1611735688153, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,1,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.164 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=2, publish_time=1611735688158, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,2,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.168 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=3, publish_time=1611735688164, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,3,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.175 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=4, publish_time=1611735688168, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,4,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.180 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=5, publish_time=1611735688175, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,5,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.185 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=6, publish_time=1611735688180, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,6,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.191 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=7, publish_time=1611735688185, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,7,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.195 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=8, publish_time=1611735688191, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,8,-1,0)\r\n2021-01-27 16:21:28.200 INFO  [0x118964dc0] SampleProducer:41 | Send Message(prod=standalone-0-0, seq=9, publish_time=1611735688195, payload_size=5, msg_id=(-1,-1,-1,-1), props={}) to (0,9,-1,0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n8.
