The Libcloud code required one minor fix to handle the different behaviour related to ETags in the Amazon S3 and Ceph RGW implementations. Ceph RGW is not shipping ETag headers in this case so the code needs to handle the case where ETags don't exist.\n\nBTW, Ceph RGW was not handling the case for unsigned payloads in the PUT method so I pushed this support in Ceph and it is upstream now with Jewel 10.2.0\n\nThe PUT method is working now. Tests are passing.

I updated the PR to adjust the hierarchy although pylint is expected to fail with this new update. With this PR I am suggesting the following hierarchy:\n\nS3RGWOutscaleStorageDriver -> S3RGWStorageDriver -> S3StorageDriver\n\nThe Outscale code is looking for reusing all methods in the RGW driver (_ex_connection_class_kwargs, etc) but the constructor. That's the reason to see pylint failing. In the case of S3RGWOutscaleStorageDriver the code calls the S3RGWStorageDriver's parent instead of the S3RGWOutscaleStorageDriver's parent as expected by pylint. It is also passing 2.x and 3.x series together with lint checks so perhaps the approach could be considered good enough.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/219874116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/220161449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/790#issuecomment-220161449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/790","id":220161449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDE2MTQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"anze3db","id":513444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzQ0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db","html_url":"https://github.com/anze3db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anze3db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T21:19:09Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T21:19:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updating pricing.json with `scrape-ec2-prices.py` caused multiple tests to fail, because some prices that were previously set are now `N/A`.

I was working on your review comments the last hours but I was not fast enough to update the PR before merging and closing this PR.\n\nI think I have a PR addressing your previous comments now. It has a better design and it is not forced by the kwargs issue.\n\nI reviewed the class-hierarchy stuff and I think we are on the same page. I was using UML notation (maybe not the best choice to communicate my idea in plain text, sorry!) with the following meaning subclass -> superclass. As mentioned I think we are on the same page. The code follows this class hierarchy.\n\nBy the way,  I think the lint fix could be breaking the driver cause it will call on the parent constructor without the signature_version parameter (it was pop'ed in the subclass) so the parent will set the default signature (v2). The previous code was jumping over the parent's constructor. It was the reason to lint complaining.\n\nAs commented, I will test the link fix and I will open a new PR to fix it if needed together with the improvements suggested by you on the previous revision.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/220566050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/220567869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/790#issuecomment-220567869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/790","id":220567869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDU2Nzg2OQ==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T10:10:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T10:10:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Made

added some additional asserts (084ce3cf7eaeeb4bd6bb0b5472b9f75ca59ec6cd) and merged changes into trunk. I believe there is still a bug with they way the host is handled though:\n\n``` python\n       ....\n        self.driver_v2 = self.driver_type(*self.driver_args,\n                                          signature_version='2',\n                                          host='host1')\n        self.driver_v4 = self.driver_type(*self.driver_args,\n                                          signature_version='4',\n                                          host='host2')\n\n        print self.driver_v2.connectionCls.host\n        print self.driver_v4.connectionCls.host\n```\n\nAnd when running it:\n\n``` bash\nosu.eu-west-2.outscale.com\nosu.eu-west-2.outscale.com\n```\n\nAs you can see, the host argument is ignored. That's probably because when `connectionCls` is instantiated, the `host` argument you set in the driver class constructor is overridden - as mentioned before, I recommend you to use `_ex_connection_class_kwargs` method. Overriding class variables is usually not a good idea, because it results in bugs and issues like that.\n\nIt would be great if you can look into it and also add corresponding tests (I didn't include those tests in the commit so it would cause the build to fail). When working on a fix, you can start with a failing test case :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/220824743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
