Because of that, I doesn't need the nginx-proxy and dnymasq.\r\nI disabled sparkUI completely, because the URL in zeppelin-server GUI is wrong, but I can access the sparkUI manually via ingress.\r\n\r\nI use a [K8s-Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) to manage the zeppelin server. The current [pod example](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml#L77-L166) is unsatisfactory, because if a [Node dies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-lifetime) the pod also dies.\r\nMy zeppelin-server deployment looks like this. [GitHub-Gist](https://gist.github.com/Reamer/bac4e568064809160c969034ed5a4b18).\r\nBecause of the deployment, this [condition in zeppelin code](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/98b26a12f4ebe73e9ab9aa011e9a8a56731addbe/zeppelin-plugins/launcher/k8s-standard/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/launcher/K8sStandardInterpreterLauncher.java#L112) isn't truth any more.

Thanks for the comment.\r\n\r\nProxy sutff via nginx and go-dnsmasq is there to make Zeppelin on Kubernetes out of the box, including SparkUI, on minkube environment. The current configuration out of the Box does not include Ingress controller.\r\n\r\nSo, it is up to the user to how to configure Ingress controller. One way (a) is like you did let each interpreter create Ingress configuration in their creation, another way (b) is to let one ingress controller accept all traffic and make nginx proxy route traffic to individual interpreters.\r\n\r\nI think it is better to let the user decide (a) or (b). while\r\n  - some ingress controller (like cloud provider's ingress controller) takes few minutes to be created, and some does not (like nginx ingress controller)\r\n  - some ingress controller takes additional cost (like cloud provider's ingress controller) on each creation, and some does not (like nginx ingress controller)\r\n  - ingress controller need to be customized for each user (like host, path, domain name, subdomain name, tls, etc) \r\n\r\nSo, how about make out-of-box configuration ready for both (a) and (b), and let user decide which one to use?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/612091801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/612094455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3728#issuecomment-612094455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3728","id":612094455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjA5NDQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-10T15:58:12Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T15:59:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Regarding using Deployment for instead of Pod, I generally agree but I think we need one consideration.\r\n\r\nSome interpreters (like markdown, jdbc) are stateless.

I think it should make things easier.\r\n\r\nUsing subpath changes git commands in a way which breaks them. For e.g. the root of git repo is `<parent of Folder A>`, but using subpath means that the relative note path for note A in Folder D becomes simply `note A` instead of `Folder A/Folder C/ Folder D/note A`. This causes git commands to fail as the relative path is wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/620469750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/620538963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3640#issuecomment-620538963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3640","id":620538963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDUzODk2Mw==","user":{"login":"rhajek","id":2169548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2169548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek","html_url":"https://github.com/rhajek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhajek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T11:08:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T11:16:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

think I understand your approach.\r\nYou should change your view. `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR` should handle the Git Root-Directory you should introduce a new variable like
