I have updated the patch to address all comments.\r\n\r\nOn the Kafka side, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4462 is the umbrella patch that makes sure the 0.11 client can talk to broker with version 0.10.2 or later. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4548 added integration tests (executed with Vagrant and Docker) which verified that new client can talk to old broker.\r\n\r\nI think we can manually test that Samza compiled with Kafka 0.11 can work with Kafka 0.10.2 or later. But it may take a lot of work to add integration test for this in Samza. Currently Samza's integration test will always use the same version of Kafka client library as the version of the Kafka cluster it starts. We will probably need similar integration test framework as Kafka (with Vagrant and Docker) to do this compatibility test.\r\n

While I'm +1 to your idea, I'm trying to ensure that the open-source codebase doesn't remain in a state where some `Config` classes follow inheritance while others follow composition for a long period of time. Ideally, I would love to make all changes in one-shot throughout the Samza code-base. It need not have to be a single PR but would be nice if you have all necessary PRs ready and if they can be merged in quick succession. cc: @prateekm @nickpan47 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/358387002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/358393678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/373#issuecomment-358393678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/373","id":358393678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODM5MzY3OA==","user":{"login":"vjagadish1989","id":18561937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989","html_url":"https://github.com/vjagadish1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-17T18:14:56Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T18:14:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fredji97 : Please can you resolve the conflict and we should be good to merge this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/358393678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
