I'm just thinking that after one version of a Delete ES processor is available, the rest would be desired, requested, and possibly implemented. If that were the case, would it be better to have 3 new processors for delete, or to update the 3 Put processors to accept delete?

Although the proposed change can keep a signal when there are counts remaining, I found that:\r\n\r\n- Current implementation of Wait and WaitNotifyProtocal are already complex, and adding another execution branch would make it more complex, and hard to maintain\r\n- Calling WaitNotifyProtocol.notify method from Wait is not expected by design.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to propose different approach, that refactors and consolidates current implementation so that Wait processor has less different execution paths in its code.

that I first tried the approach you mentioned (use local time zone) will encounter problem with Time type.\r\nMy time zone is UTC+8, which cause time string like “01:01:01” in Time type will become negative long value.\r\nThis is reasonable because Time type only consider time without epoch so it will be negative if it’s earlier than “08:00:00”.\r\n\r\nHowever this will not pass the LONG_PATTERN in PutSQL and thus consider a negative long value to be in format \"HH:mm:ss.SSS” instead of long.\r\nThis will encounter error while parsing for sure : java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: “-28739000”.\r\n\r\nIf I try your commit with changing the timeStr to “01:01:01\" in testUsingDateTimeValuesWithFormatAttribute will encounter negative long parsing problem which mentioned above.\r\nDon’t know if you will encounter similar problem with **negative long value in Time type**, too?\r\n\r\nI've try your commit together with LONG_PATTERN that also match negative long value (\"^-?\\\\d{1,19}$”) today and everything works fine now.\r\nThanks for any

There are only 2 differences aside from the version upgrades:\r\n\r\n1. `aopalliance:aopalliance:1.0` moves from `org.springframework:spring-aop:jar:4.2.4.RELEASE` to `org.springframework.security:spring-security-core:jar:4.2.3.RELEASE` but has the same version and license as currently exists.\r\n1. `ring-cors:ring-cors:0.1.5` is a new transitive dependency brought in by `org.apache.storm:storm-core:jar:1.1.1` after it was upgraded from `1.0.1`. `ring-cors` uses the [EPL 1.0](https://eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php), which is considered [Category B by Apache](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b). I believe this is acceptable from the statement:\r\n\r\n> For small amounts of source that is directly consumed by the ASF product at runtime in source form, and for which that source is unmodified and unlikely to be changed anyway (say, by virtue of being specified by a standard), inclusion of appropriately labeled source is also permitted.\r\n\r\nThere is no existing `LICENSE` or `NOTICE` file in the `nifi-external` or `nifi-external/nifi-storm-spout` modules, which is where this code is brought in. @joewitt , please advise on proper license/notice model to follow/copy here.

Sorry I didn't notice until now. So I think that what you're proposing here is that we should have a property named \"Schema Text Format\" on the readers/writers, in addition to \"Schema Text\", and the Schema Text Format would tell the service how to parse the \"Schema Text.\" For example, there would be two options: \"Avro\" and \"String Column Names\". In addition to this, we could potentially also introduce a new Schema Registry as I described above. This means that for one-off types of schemas, such as when we have a CSV file and we only need to use the schema once, we don't have to go to the trouble of creating a Schema Registry and adding entries to it - we'd just set the column names (optionally using Expression Language) in the Reader. And we would add this capability to JSON, etc. as well.\r\n\r\nDoes that all sound accurate? Just want to make sure that we are on the same page here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/323138141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/323143682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2020#issuecomment-323143682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2020","id":323143682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzE0MzY4Mg==","user":{"login":"rickysaltzer","id":347356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzM1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer","html_url":"https://github.com/rickysaltzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-17T17:40:52Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T17:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You could push my force push my commit to this PR and that'll be fine, too.

This reduced the volume of this PR, a little bit.\r\n- Rebased with the latest master, and updated few new classes to meet the new RecordSetWriterFactory method signatures.\r\n\r\nLocal contrib check passed without issue.
