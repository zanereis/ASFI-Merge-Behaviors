I don't think we need to test that path when there is a recommended alternative.\r\n\r\nI think this change to the test is necessary to test the right upgrade scenario and avoid consumer timeouts.

you very much for the PR @rajinisivaram. I am trying to understand where we do the disruptive change. We currently start the broker with the plaintext and client protocol ports open:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        self.kafka.security_protocol = client_protocol\r\n        self.kafka.interbroker_security_protocol = \"PLAINTEXT\"\r\n        self.kafka.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe then start to produce and consume via `client_protocol` and do the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n       # Roll cluster to include inter broker security protocol.\r\n        self.kafka.interbroker_security_protocol = broker_protocol\r\n        self.kafka.open_port(client_protocol)\r\n        self.kafka.open_port(broker_protocol)\r\n        self.bounce()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe change the inter-broker protocol, open the ports for client (which seems unnecessary) and broker protocol and then bounce the brokers. The changes should only take effect when we bounce the brokers, right? So, I don't see any period where the we do a disruptive change, but I could be missing something.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/282318447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/282318951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2589#issuecomment-282318951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2589","id":282318951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjMxODk1MQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T15:26:48Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T15:26:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh, I see.
