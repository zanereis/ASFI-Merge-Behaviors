I was pretty close to getting nashorn to execute gremlin-javascript natively, but there's weird pathing issue and npm integration issues that just aren't making it easy (possible). I tried to hack my way around the pathing problems and while i was making progress it was just getting ugly. I'll need to think about the language agnostic approach a bit before I worry about trying to go any further in this direction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/327892950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/327964557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/705#issuecomment-327964557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/705","id":327964557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzk2NDU1Nw==","user":{"login":"mpollmeier","id":506752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/mpollmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpollmeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T00:14:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T00:14:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"there we go @spmallette @robertdale ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/327964557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/328025536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/695#issuecomment-328025536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/695","id":328025536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODAyNTUzNg==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T07:36:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T07:36:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've removed support for Nashorn as part of #626 (see first comment).

So I technically preferred the PR as it was as opposed to a generalized utility function that will work shoddily for large graphs. \r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the solution I have that should make everyone content. @okram liked this as a utility class but ultimately didn't have strong feeling about it either way. @mpollmeier seemed to make it clear that this was to help with testing. How about we just move `GraphHelper` to gremlin-test. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-test/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin\r\n\r\nThen it is a utility that clearly exists for testing use cases only.  TinkerGraph depends on gremlin-test and can thus directly test it's capabilties - maybe just add your \"clone\" test to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/tinkergraph-gremlin/src/test/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph/structure/TinkerGraphTest.java\r\n\r\n@mpollmeier if this is agreeable to you, perhaps wait a few days to see if there are other comments before progressing forward. i'd hate for you to make more changes and then someone yells -1 at you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/329761788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/329789246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/715#issuecomment-329789246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/715","id":329789246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTc4OTI0Ng==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T13:53:13Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T13:53:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Using the modern graph:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngremlin> g.V().emit().repeat(both()).times(3).limit(15).path()\r\n==>[v[1]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[2]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[4]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[1]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[1],v[3]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[1],v[2]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[1],v[4]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[4]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[4],v[5]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[4],v[3]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[4],v[1]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[6]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[3],v[6],v[3]]\r\n==>[v[1],v[2],v[1]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n^ This doesn't look like DFS to me.

Let me explain what I know and hopefully you or someone else can fill the blanks. \r\n\r\nLet's take my toy graph `v5 <- v3 <- v1 <- v0 -> v2 -> v4 -> v6` since it's easier to see where you are with a simple println of the vertex. Without emit, this PR does what it's supposed to do: DFS. First the even numbers, then the odds. \r\n\r\n```\r\ngraph = TinkerGraph.open()\r\nv0 = graph.addVertex(\"l0\")\r\nv1 = graph.addVertex(\"l1\")\r\nv2 = graph.addVertex(\"l1\")\r\nv3 = graph.addVertex(\"l2\")\r\nv4 = graph.addVertex(\"l2\")\r\nv5 = graph.addVertex(\"l3\")\r\nv6 = graph.addVertex(\"l3\")\r\nv0.addEdge(\"e\", v2)\r\nv2.addEdge(\"e\", v4)\r\nv4.addEdge(\"e\", v6)\r\nv0.addEdge(\"e\", v1)\r\nv1.addEdge(\"e\", v3)\r\nv3.addEdge(\"e\", v5)\r\ngraph.traversal().V(v0).repeat(sideEffect{println(\"inside repeat at \" + it)}.out()).times(3)\r\ninside repeat at v[0]\r\ninside repeat at v[2]\r\ninside repeat at v[4]\r\n==>v[6]\r\ninside repeat at v[1]\r\ninside repeat at v[3]\r\n==>v[5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever if I add an `emit()` it becomes BFS again:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngraph.traversal().V(v0).emit().repeat(sideEffect{println(\"inside repeat at \" + it)}.out()).times(3)\r\n==>v[0]\r\ninside repeat at v[0]\r\n==>v[2]\r\ninside repeat at v[2]\r\n==>v[1]\r\ninside repeat at v[1]\r\n==>v[4]\r\ninside repeat at v[4]\r\n==>v[6]\r\n==>v[3]\r\ninside repeat at v[3]\r\n==>v[5]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to understand it in the debugger, and the core difference seems to be the behaviour of `this.starts.hasNext()` in `RepeatEndStep.standardAlgorithm`, which is an `ExpandableStepIterator`. \r\n* without emit, `hasNext` finds that `this.hostStep.getPreviousStep().hasNext()` is true, because it asks it's `previousStep` (which is a `VertexStep(OUT)`), which in turns has some results for `processNextStart`. \r\n* with emit, the above chain returns false, which in turn leads to a NoSuchElementException, which short-circuits and `while (true)` loop, which results in losing DFS semantics.\r\n\r\nI don't know where these different semantics derive from.
