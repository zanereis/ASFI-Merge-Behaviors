With the fencing operation marking the VM as stopped, does it mean that the same remote disk volume is used if the VM is spawned on another host (while the other one still running on the first host)?\r\n\r\n@abhinandanprateek if the reason to fence off the VM is to clean up resources, IMO this should be the job of the VM sync, on the ping command/startup command. In case a host is lost, the capacity of the cluster should reflect the lose of that host and the stat capacity should calculate its value based on the hosts that are Up only. When a host comes back (possibly with some VMs still running), the startup command should sync the VM states and the capacity of the cluster/zone should be updated. \r\nIn short, cleaning up resources that are not \"reachable\" anymore should not be needed and should not be taken into account when calculating the actual capacity of the cluster/zone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/261955835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/261958544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/756#issuecomment-261958544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/756","id":261958544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTk1ODU0NA==","user":{"login":"prashanthvarma","id":3722369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3722369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma","html_url":"https://github.com/prashanthvarma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashanthvarma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T14:51:32Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T14:51:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rhtyd Here are the screen-shots without and with this UI bug fix:\r\n\r\n![6a4ded44-adb4-4821-bceb-3eb8c44c79f8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3722369/20486648/d037587a-b000-11e6-9cda-f82e52747626.jpg)\r\n\r\n![rsz_screenshot_from_2016-11-21_15-15-52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3722369/20486654/d65af0ae-b000-11e6-9201-d2df4e8bcd7f.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by @nlivens in the previous comment, \"The actual Public Load Balancer provider is derived from the VPC offering, and not from this extra field \"Public Load Balancer Provider\".

This data is to be stored in *details tables.\r\nAbout existing API methods, I have checked `updateTemplate` and `updateVirtualMachines` methods before adding this new methods, and they provide a way to add/update details (although updateTemplate overrides existing details). Also, details can be listed on `listTemplates` and `listVirtualMachines` but thought the best approach was introducing this new methods to reduce overhead and treat entity details separately instead of updating/listing the entity every time. What do you think of this approach?
