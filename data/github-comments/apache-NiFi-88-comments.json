\r\n\r\nI have updated my code to use the Apache Pulsar 2.0 client API, but cannot commit the changes yet, as the release vote is still pending, and thus the client jar file hasn't been released to

Processors\r\n\r\n1. Launch a docker container running Apache Pulsar 2.0:  \r\n    docker pull apachepulsar/pulsar:2.0.0-rc1-incubating\r\n    docker run -d -i --name pulsar -p 6650:6650 -p 8000:8080 apachepulsar/pulsar:2.0.0-rc1-incubating\r\n\r\n2. ssh into the pulsar container and start the Pulsar service\r\n    docker exec -it pulsar /bin/bash\r\n    root@266e559270ce:/pulsar/bin/pulsar standalone &\r\n\r\n3. Launch a docker container running apache NiFi 1.7.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n      docker run -d -i --name nifi --link pulsar -p 8080:8080 apache/nifi:1.7.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n4. Load the attached template to to NiFi, and start the ConsumePulsar processor FIRST.\r\n5. Then start the other processors.\r\n6. Verify that the data is being produced and consumed at the same rate.\r\n7. Open the Pulsar dashboard at http://localhost:8000 to see the topic was created and that the messages were generated.\r\n\r\n[Pulsar-Test-xml.txt](https://github.com/apache/nifi/files/2051691/Pulsar-Test-xml.txt)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/392976705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/393063241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2724#issuecomment-393063241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2724","id":393063241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzA2MzI0MQ==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T07:45:10Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T07:45:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah...

What the change does is look for specific runtime exceptions that the framework could throw and which the user code of this processor couldn't really do anything meaningful and causes the normal behavior that will happen if these exceptions leak out which is yield/rollback.  But that was done so that 'other' exceptions besides those could then be handled in a way specific to what is desired here and that is to treat the flowfile as a failure and route it appropriately.  Typically, you'd not want to be treating general exceptions as the reason for 'failure' routing and instead you'd be looking for specific conditions.  So the change here I think is just dealing with the reality of the limited options this processor must have (i didnt' look into the details but that is what makes sense to me).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395196289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/395202524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2752#issuecomment-395202524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2752","id":395202524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTIwMjUyNA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T20:27:21Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T20:27:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman that's a good call.

Route these to failure as yield/rollback isn't viable and wont solve the problem.\r\n\r\nCategory3: If you know bad stuff can happen but cannot detect them ahead of time and there isn't a clear finite set of things to detect then doing what you're doing to isolate them by instead putting the frameworky things in a finite set and calling all else as 'failure' is fair game.\r\n\r\nYour case appears to be Category3 right now so you're handling it fine for that.

See ControllerFacade.java:1353. This getEvent() method call is prior to createProvenanceEventDto(). So, it would be redundant to authorize the user for the event inside createProvenanceEventDto() as any unauthorized events will have already been filtered out. The original approach was to exclude all events from a provenance query result for which the user is not authorized (e.g. the user is not in the 'view provenance' component level policy). Therefore, it should not be necessary to perform your point #2 above.\r\n\r\nFor point #3 and a slight refactor of authorizeReplay(), I've renamed it to authorizeData(). And, removed the duplicate authorization block from getProvenanceEvent(). Instead, the createProvenanceEventDto() will perform the data authorization prior to the if !summarize block.

Certainly the processor can use a deep learning model to classify or predict using regression, but current approach that writing evaluation result into FlowFile content may not be useful in real data flows.\r\n\r\nLet's say user want to route incoming data into different branches of a data flow to process differently. The most basic use-case would be binary classification. If a given data is predicted as class A, then do something, such as sending an alert. In order to do so, we need to carry original data to report meaningful alert. By rewriting FlowFile content only using result makes it difficult to tie-up original data and prediction result, and it is hard to construct subsequent flow.\r\n\r\nBy considering real use-cases more, I started feeling this is more of a Enrich or Lookup pattern.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Original dataset\r\nRecord1\r\nRecord2\r\nRecord3\r\n\r\n# Convert the original dataset into a vector to applying a model, while keeping original data to preserve relationships.\r\nRecord1, Feature Vector1\r\nRecord2, Feature Vector2\r\nRecord3, Feature Vector3\r\n\r\n# Then we can further enrich records with prediction results\r\nRecord1, Result1 (A:0.9, B:0.1)\r\nRecord2, Result2 (A:0.85, B:0.15)\r\nRecord3, Result3 (A:0.05, B:0.95)\r\n\r\n# Once we have such FlowFile, we can filter certain dataset based on prediction\r\n# Route class A into flow branch A\r\nRecord1\r\nRecord2\r\n# Route class B into branch B\r\nRecord 3\r\n\r\n# Then we can produce some meaningful report using original information\r\nSend an alert based on Record3\r\n```\r\n\r\nHave you ever looked at LookupRecord processor and RecordLookupService controller service?
