Annotations across 2 charts. this is similar to #2 but down side is that you cannot filter across the annotation as far as I am aware.\r\n\r\nIf you really do need tight integration you would have to either do it in the ETL pre-Druid ingestion or perhaps customize the SQL Alchemy engine to meet your needs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/397780573/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/397816662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5220#issuecomment-397816662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5220","id":397816662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzgxNjY2Mg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-16T14:39:26Z","updated_at":"2018-06-16T14:39:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5220?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5220](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5220?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/7b49b6c2de4746ff1b1b87222f556800db47bbc4?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5220/graphs/tree.svg?token=KsB0fHcx6l&width=650&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5220?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #5220   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   63.45%   63.45%           \n=======================================\n  Files         261      261           \n  Lines       19842    19842           \n  Branches     1998     1998           \n=======================================\n  Hits        12591    12591           \n  Misses       7242     7242           \n  Partials        9        9\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5220?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5220?src=pr&el=footer).
