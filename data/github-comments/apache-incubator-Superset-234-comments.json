It makes sense to pull the tagging actions into its own file because it would be shared between both Explore and Dashboard views, but I think that maintaining the state of tags in its own redux store would be more typical and follow the patterns i've seen throughout superset already.\r\n\r\nGreat question. Yeah, we've been running this code at Lyft for maybe a year now, so it's definitely outdated and would be written differently from scratch today.\r\n\r\nIIRC we went with API functions since the state lives outside the applications (explore, dashboards, SQL Lab). Maybe @mistercrunch remembers better?\r\n\r\n> I would recommend creating a new directory in assets/src/tags to keep the component files, the main tags page, the redux actions and the reducers and then wire up the required state to both explore and dashboard components. It would make tagging consistent with the rest of the app, clearer, and easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/503684944/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/503713210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7736#issuecomment-503713210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7736","id":503713210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzcxMzIxMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-19T19:24:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T23:39:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7736?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`master@7a575ce`).

For instance, if I don't correctly `from pydruid.utils.having import Having`, then I can't declare DimSelector. If I don't declare DimSelector, then I can't use `_get_having_obj(self, col, op, eq)` in models.py. And of course it starts getting deeper than that -- I haven't followed it deep enough but I suspect the whole Python file becomes useless.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to remove completely the druid-related code from the `db upgrade` and `load_examples` commands (whatever that means)? Or you just suggest to `pass` every time we can't correctly declare a symbol for lack of imports?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/503938014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/503939983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7643#issuecomment-503939983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7643","id":503939983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzkzOTk4Mw==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T08:52:51Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T08:52:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sturmer I agree, it's not trivial and there are several options, all with pros and cons.
