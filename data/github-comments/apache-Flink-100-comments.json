I just saw that the build actually failed and it seems to me that the problem is indeed related to removing the dependency to asm from the pom.xml as Robert suggested? So I could either add the dependency again or do you see any option to solve this otherwise?\n\nThere is one remaining question that I already started to discuss with Till about the select functions in PatternStream. The Java API wants to call them with java.util.Map as parameters, but I don't think we want Java classes in our Scala API. Currently I see two options how to change this without touching the Java API:\n\n1) Use Scala mutable.Map and automatic conversion.\n2) Use Scala immutable.Map and explicit conversion. From how I interpret the actual use of the Map in this function, the semantics are actually that of an immutable map.\n\nIf the impact of the conversion is not an issue, I have already implemented version 2 (it is currently commented out in favor of a version that still uses Java Map.

The original dataset handled by a `map` operator to ensure that the type of partition key is same with the boundary in the supplied distribution. In the `DataDistribution` interface, the type of `getBucketBoundary` method returned is `Object[]`. My doubt is whether this can be changed to type of `Tuple`. I mean that when range partition by one field, it return `Tuple1` and two fields return `Tuple2`. Also in the `OutputEmmiter`, change the type of keys from `Object[]` to `Tuple` and comparing the key with boundary using `Tuple` comparator. If this is possible, the boundaries in the distribution for rangePartition test will be:\n`Tuple2<Integer, Long>[] boundaries = new Tuple2[]{\nnew Tuple2(1, 1L),\nnew Tuple2(3, 2L),\n....\n}`\nThis can make the test more succinct and direct.\nAnother confusing is that why partitionByHash and partitionByRange do not support some KeySelectors returned Tuple type such as:\n\n```\npublic static class KeySelector3 implements KeySelector<Tuple3<Integer,Long,String>, Tuple2<Integer,Long>> {\n        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n        @Override\n        public Tuple2<Integer,Long> getKey(Tuple3<Integer,Long,String> in) {\n            return new Tuple2<>(in.f0,in.f1);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nand can not run the following codes:\n\n```\nDataSet<Tuple3<Integer,Long,String>> dataSet = ...;\ndataSet.partitionByRange(new KeySelector3());\n```\n\nCan you explain it to me?Thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/212300584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/212305774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1915#issuecomment-212305774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1915","id":212305774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjMwNTc3NA==","user":{"login":"stefanobortoli","id":6428160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjgxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6428160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanobortoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanobortoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T07:46:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T07:46:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We had a look at the Flink test dependency hierarchies and the thing is feasible but I it should be done in a separate PR.

I have only marked the first occurrences where I've noticed it.\n\nThe Scala code contained several lines which exceeded the maximum line length of 100 characters. The Scala style check plugin, which detects these style violations, is executed when you run `mvn verify`.

E.g. it is trying to use the pipeline, but still gets gigged in the scaler.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/212916215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/212942014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1849#issuecomment-212942014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1849","id":212942014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjk0MjAxNA==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T14:27:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T14:48:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"~~Well breeze was recently bumped to 0.12 #1876, maybe that has something to do with it, but let's see.~~\n\n~~Any chance you can try with the prev.

The `ExecutionEnvironment` reuses the config. This problem is not always visible because it depends on Akka whether the class is serialized or simply passed as a reference. If the class is serialized, then a deserialization of the lists won't affect the original reference.\n\nAs a solution, I've wrapped the types/serializer lists in a `SerilizableCacheableValue` which keeps the value for as long as possible and deserializes using the default class loader when not explicitly deserialized during task instantiating. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/213003239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/213030347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1856#issuecomment-213030347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1856","id":213030347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzAzMDM0Nw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T17:34:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T17:34:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your contribution @ramkrish86.

I don't think it is a good idea to tie `closeInputFormat()` to `configure()` because `configure()` is called at different places such as the JobManager and in the optimizer to retrieve statistics. Hence, it is not a good idea to open resources in `configure()`.\n\nWe should rather add a `openInputFormat()` method to `RichInputFormat()` which is called directly before `open()`. Would you add such a method and remove the unnecessary `closeInputFormat()` calls, and tests that check that `openInputFormat()` and `closeInputFormat()` are correctly called in the life cycle of a RichInputFormat? \n\nSorry for not thinking about this earlier.

I will do a more detailed review hopefully soon.\n\nThanks also for adding a lot of tests. It is definitely good to have extensive test coverage, but end-to-end tests such as yours add quite a bit to the build time. Flink uses Travis as CI service which kills builds after 2h. Unfortunately, we are experiencing build time outs already and have to be careful when adding tests.\n\nI would like to ask you to remove some of the tests which check for different expression syntax but end up in identical executions. In addition, it would be good to add one SQL test that executes a query which sorts on two fields to have the SQL part covered.\n\nWe will add a unit test framework, that checks for correct parsing of the expressions without actually executing queries in a separate effort. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/213565509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/213567820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1916#issuecomment-213567820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1916","id":213567820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzU2NzgyMA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T19:53:50Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T19:53:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the additional information @yjshen!
