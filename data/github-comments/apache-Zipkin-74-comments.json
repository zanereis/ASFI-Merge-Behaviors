are a place to discuss changes to code, not general question and\nanswer.\n\nbased on the trace you posted I dont see a bug in zipkin which is the repo\nyou are discussing on right now. I think you are not instrumenting properly\nand should look at brave project and its various readme. I think it would\nhelp both of us if you start with a working example even if you dont use\nspring.\n\nRegardless, use existing instrumentation there before creating your own.\nfor example we have tests which mean we know the scenarios where something\nworks or not. For example, there is okhttp instrumentation in brave and it\nhad a README and also is tested.\n\nIf you need more discussion please go to https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\nas again issues are for changes not troubleshooting\n\nOn Sun, 30 Sep 2018, 16:49 wxmimperio, <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @adriancole <https://github.com/adriancole>\n>\n> If my app not use spring frame,even not web app, just a normal java app.\n> And this app use okHttp to request spring restful API, it can not tracing\n> in Zipkin?\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2200#issuecomment-425705320>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAD61-fH7Y5hrn2h08jlN_q7kT8Q77cqks5ugIWugaJpZM4W-Cmz>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/425717702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/425847245","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2202#issuecomment-425847245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2202","id":425847245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTg0NzI0NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T09:39:58Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T09:39:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks again!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/425847245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/425849597","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2203#issuecomment-425849597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2203","id":425849597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTg0OTU5Nw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T09:47:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T09:47:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks.. in the future, can you please bundle together incidental versions?
