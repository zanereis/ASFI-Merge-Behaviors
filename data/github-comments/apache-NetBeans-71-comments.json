unfortunately you are right. But what speaks against it is the following case:\r\n\r\nI have 5 - 6 Web projects open (next to a lot of others, web independent projects).\r\nOne project is the biggest, that I'm working on, it is from my company. The node_modules folder has 115.605 files and 18.964 folders. The node_modules folder is 963 mb big. It is a mono repo with nrwl-nx - Angular application. After I removed the node_modules from the ignored files pattern, NetBeans started indexing. This project, needed round about 1h to finish and the web projects needed round about 1 more hour. So all in all it ~ 2h for indexing/background scanning the node_modules folder. Which seems waaaaaay to long.\r\n\r\nMy environment is a Surface Laptop 3, Windows 10, latest version with an i7, 16GB RAM and a M2 SSD. Afaik, not even Windows need that much time to indexing 100k files. I know this is another case but there is also another application called everything: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_(software) It took round about 30s - 1m to index the whole SSD with 3.638.195 files on it. It is written in C/C++ and assembler. Just to let you know, that I don't understand, why NetBeans took so long so as you see it gets faster. Btw Windows Defender is disabled, so this can't be the problem.\r\n\r\nSo long story short, whether there is possible to be as fast as the everything tool, which would be pretty awesome in any case and second, if not possible my solution for indexing the node_modules would be to read out all packages from the package.json and bower.json, that should be fast enough I guess. Also, indexing all modules, that are used by require() and the ES 6 modules with import etc. So that would be a good improvement to still have code completion for all imported modules and maybe sub modules like incrementialy index.\r\n\r\nIs one of those solutions possible? IMHO, it is not needed to index all files in node_modules. Or someone knows how VS Code and WebStorm does it. WebStorm is also fast enough for my point of view. It just needed ~2min to index the company project which is quite good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/706742979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/706744123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2438#issuecomment-706744123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2438","id":706744123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjc0NDEyMw==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-11T18:08:41Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T18:11:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Chris2011 so this is a big hammer that helps you, but might be a problem for \"normal\" JS users. \r\n\r\nI can explain why indexing in netbeans is slow: Because the JS indexer tries to deal with the mess, that is the JS ecosystem.

If you use npm you install your dep and it installs more deps, etc. The other 4 projects are not that big but still have > 20k files inside of it and those are normal JS projects created with Vue CLI or Angular CLI etc. So some other people complained about that in Stack Overflow too \"How can I prevent node_modules from indexing in NetBeans\".

The JS files are parsed in context and that is a dramatic slowdown.\r\n\r\nJust in NetBeans, not in any other major IDEs/Editor. I tried it couple of minutes ago with WebStorm, the result is significant and this is what I expect for NetBeans too. WebStorm also indexes the node_modules folder as I can see, when I open a web project, what my company project was. So as I understand it right, just the JS parser in NetBeans is slow and not a JS parser in general.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thx for the hint with the indexing we can revert it, but we need a solution for that. Here again:\r\n\r\n* Make the JS paraser as fast as possible to make it comparable with other major IDEs. 2h is to long and it is even possible.\r\n* Just index the packages from the package.json and bower.json because those are the packages that are used via require() and import\r\n* Make the indexing in NetBeans as fast as possible and take a look into the everything tool.\r\n\r\nYes I can understand that not just indexing, but also parsing is done here.
