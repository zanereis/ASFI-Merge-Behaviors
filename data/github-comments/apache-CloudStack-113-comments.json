Then we executed the migration script and verified the commands.properties are no longer available and all the rules are migrated in the DB. This was performed with regular users as well as LDAP and SAML users. Fresh installation of 4.9 was also tested, by default dynamic-checker is enabled. Also regression testing was performed on creating and using custom rules.

I am trying to understand how reordering should work.  For example, a user creates a role with a set of rules ordered as follows:\n1. Rule A\n2. Rule B\n3. Rule C\n4. Rule D\n5. Rule E\n6. Rule F\n\nLater, the user reorders the rules as follows:\n1. Rule A\n2. Rule D\n3. Rule B\n4. Rule C\n5. Rule E\n6. Rule F\n\nAs I understand the API, the following discrete API calls are required to affect this change:\n1. `updateRolePermission(roleId: \"Rule D\", parentUUID: \"Rule A\")`\n2. `updateRolePermission(roleId: \"Rule B\", parentUUID: \"Rule D\")`\n3. `updateRolePermission(roleId: \"Rule C\", parentUUID: \"Rule B\")`\n\nAssuming my understanding regarding the API usage is correct, I have the following concerns about this approach:\n1. **Operation Interleaving**: Since each API call can only provide a guarantee the persistence of a single list mutation, it is possible for two users to concurrently change the order of rules for permission.  The result of this operation interleaving would leave the order of the rules in an indeterminate order.  \n2. **Client Complexity**: This model places a burden on clients to track the mutations to the list of rules rather than simply tracking the current order of the list.  This additional complexity could lead to more error prone client code.\n\nAs a user my expectation would be to reorder all rules associated with a permission in one atomic operation rather than a series of atomic mutation operations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/216734107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/216735024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1529#issuecomment-216735024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1529","id":216735024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjczNTAyNA==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T03:49:42Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T03:49:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mike-tutkowski I apologize for being behind on my review queue.
