@caishunfeng Ask a question, the code I submitted does not involve the dolphinscheduler-ui module, why is there a large number of errors in the js code of the dolphinscheduler-ui module in the sonar report?\r\n\r\nIt seems the sonar will check all the project files, not only the change files. You can skip the UI errors if you don't update the UI module. \r\nBut you have to check the CI build fail. see https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/en-us/community/development/DS-License.html.\r\nPTAL
