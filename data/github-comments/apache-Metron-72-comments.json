The changes in all classes except ParserRunnerImpl and ParserRunnerImplTest were fairly trivial, mainly just adjusting the return types to match the new MessageParserResult and ParserRunnerResults interfaces.\r\n\r\nMost of the work was done in ParserRunnerImpl (the execute method specifically).  Since the MessageParser interface can now return multiple messages and exceptions (and a master exception in some cases), there needs to be a way to map them to a ParserRunnerResults object (which is a list of messages and errors).   Now the primary job of this execute method is to:\r\n- call MessageParser.parseOptionalResult\r\n- post process messages returned by the MessageParser\r\n- consolidate the various errors and messages into a single ParserRunnerResults object\r\n\r\nLet me know if anyone thinks this should work differently.  I also added more javadocs to the various classes involved, primarily ParserRunnerImpl since that's where the magic happens.  This merge was fairly significant so I am planning on testing in full dev again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/429151395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/429158331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1218#issuecomment-429158331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1218","id":429158331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTE1ODMzMQ==","user":{"login":"alinazemian","id":8438293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzgyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8438293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian","html_url":"https://github.com/alinazemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alinazemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-11T23:47:31Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T23:47:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @mraliagha, that's a good suggestion. I believe we can functionally achieve that be creating a custom id field in the format you suggest (with a Stellar field transform) and set that field to be the ES id with the Ambari property exposed in this PR.

It can give users an understanding of where it is safe to play with the ID and what the recommendations are.

The basic rule is to unsubscribe when you no longer want to know about new values from a particular stream. (RxJs/Angular handling observables like streams, even if we know that there will be just one value. It's highly recommended to ignore that.)\r\nAn error is just a possible new value from a stream. It could be followed by an actual value and then an error again. \r\n\r\nActually, you are right with your concerns. The original implementation here gives no chance to handle events in a reactive way. In my opinion, our real streams here are the following:\r\n- the stream of clicks on query button (leads to a request)\r\n- the stream of clicks on the cancel button (leads to a cancel request)\r\n- the stream of PCAP values (leads to rendering table)\r\n- a stream of status changes (leads to updating several UI controls)\r\n- a stream of percentages (leads to updating progress bar)\r\n\r\nAnd we only want to unsubscribe from these streams when the user navigates away to the alert tab.\r\nIf an error occurs, the job fails, user click cancel we like to continue observing them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the implementation creates new observables on every click instead of observing the stream of clicks. This leads to the fact that we unsubscribing and resubscribing all the time. Also makes this code hard to understand and explain any change or small improvement.\r\n\r\nHowever, IMHO unsubscribe implemented in this PR is an improvement, still not the perfect state of this code part.\r\nI suggest @ruffle1986 to create a followup ticket which is about \"Implementing proper reactive event handling in PCAP\".\r\nAnd another about \"Refactor out PCAP querying logic from PCAP panel and move it to the service\". That would also make things way clearer here, hence right now the panel contains all the query logic.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/429286791/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/429304639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1226#issuecomment-429304639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1226","id":429304639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTMwNDYzOQ==","user":{"login":"tiborm","id":2437400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzc0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2437400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm","html_url":"https://github.com/tiborm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T12:10:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T12:10:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc The log output with multiple errors looks exactly as you described. \r\n\r\nThe test file size is like that because it contains the copy of a full response.

Basically, just making the existing methods in MessageParser `@deprecated` and with a new default implementation for `parse(..)` that throws a `NotImplementedException`. This does clean up some of the shrapnel we had discussed on 1234 such that there's no further need for a decorator.\r\n\r\n@merrimanr - the only thing missing here I think is to mark the `parse` and `parseOptional` methods `@deprecated`. Also, I didn't see a delete of `MultilineMessageParser` in your latest commits to go with that refactor/merge. We probably want to get rid of it altogether if we take this alternate approach. Also, I think we should make a more public statement on the user and dev list about deprecating the methods if we all agree on this approach to give users time to migrate existing custom parser implementations.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/430410666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/430534140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1226#issuecomment-430534140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1226","id":430534140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDUzNDE0MA==","user":{"login":"tiborm","id":2437400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzc0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2437400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm","html_url":"https://github.com/tiborm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T08:17:19Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T08:17:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc Yes, that's the main file.

I'll be using `/tmp/ldif/test.ldif` in this example.\r\n\r\n### Run the container.\r\n\r\nRun the container with\r\n```\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  -p 33389:389 \\\r\n  --name metron_ldap_demo \\\r\n  --env LDAP_ORGANISATION=Hadoop \\\r\n  --env LDAP_DOMAIN=apache.org \\\r\n  --env LDAP_TLS_FALSE \\\r\n  --volume /tmp/ldif:/container/service/slapd/assets/config/bootstrap/ldif/custom \\\r\n  osixia/openldap:1.2.2 --copy-service\r\n```\r\nThis does a few things\r\n* Exposes the LDAP port (389) on the host's port 33389. The host port is arbitrarily chosen\r\n* Makes sure we have the appropriate org and domain for the users\r\n* Makes sure we aren't using TLS. There are options for in the configs, but I wasn't able to get the certs lined up properly (although I was able to see both sides connecting, then failing).\r\n* Makes the test.ldif available in the right place\r\n* --copy-service needs to be provided for some reason or another. I didn't really dig into why, it's just part of the documentation\r\n\r\nThis will spin up the OpenLDAP instance and let it run.\r\n\r\n## Ambari LDAP setup\r\n\r\nFrom the command line of the vagrant machine, run\r\n`netstat -rn | grep \"^0.0.0.0 \" | cut -d \" \" -f10`. It should return the address it can use to address the host machine. E.g. for me it was \"10.0.2.2\". This is needed to be able to hit the Docker container from inside the Vagrant VM.\r\n\r\nA new tab is added \"Security\" with the various LDAP related properties.\r\nIn here, we'll went to set\r\n* LDAP URL = ldap://10.0.2.2:33389\r\n  * Make sure to fill in the IP from above!\r\n* Bind User = cn=admin,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n* Bind User Password = admin\r\n\r\nThe other fields are set already set to defaults to match the modified Knox users-ldif provided, so nothing should change.\r\nThese values are\r\n* User dn pattern = uid={0},ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n* User password attribute = userPassword\r\n* Group Search Base = ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n* User Search Filter is empty\r\n* Group Search Base = ou=groups,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n* Group Search Filter = member={0}\r\n* LDAP group role attribute = cn\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we also need to tell REST we will be using LDAP.\r\n\r\nIn the REST tab\r\n* Active Spring profiles = dev,ldap\r\n\r\nRestart Metron REST\r\n\r\n## Testing LDAP\r\nGo to the Swagger UI.  You should meet a login screen. There are 3 users that should work in LDAP\r\n* admin/admin-password\r\n  * {SSHA} format in LDAP\r\n* sam/sam-password\r\n  * Plaintext format in LDAP\r\n* tom/tom-password\r\n  * Plaintext format in LDAP\r\n\r\nIn Swagger, the UserController has another endpoint: \"/whoami/roles\".  Using this endpoint should return the roles for each user\r\n* admin has ROLE_ADMIN\r\n* sam has ROLE_USER\r\n* tom has no roles.\r\n\r\nThese ROLES can be altered by changing the LDAP groups each user belongs to, e.g. see https://gist.github.com/justinleet/b8f0350f27b32d4d705f45b9c1ba8c6e#file-test-ldif-L95 for how \"sam\" is added to the \"user\" group.\r\n\r\nThis same login should also apply to the Alerts UI and Management UI.  Login via JDBC should also not be able to happen (e.g. user/password login should no longer work).\r\n\r\n## SSL Note\r\nIf anyone is brave enough to try, or wants to help me, you can run the container with\r\n```\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  -p 33389:389 \\\r\n  -p 33636:636 \\\r\n  --name metron_ldap_demo \\\r\n  --env LDAP_ORGANISATION=Hadoop \\\r\n  --env LDAP_DOMAIN=apache.org \\\r\n  --env LDAP_TLS_VERIFY_CLIENT=try \\\r\n  --volume /tmp/ldif:/container/service/slapd/assets/config/bootstrap/ldif/custom \\\r\n  osixia/openldap:1.2.2 --copy-service\r\n```\r\nThis will setup the appropriate SSL port and map it to 33636. `LDAP_TLS_VERIFY_CLIENT=try ` seems necessary to be able to connect from outside the container.\r\n\r\nIn the Vagrant box, it's necessary to import the appropriate certificates to the truststore to be used.  Generally this can be done with\r\n```\r\nkeytool -importcert -keystore <keystore file> -alias <unique alias> -storepass <password> -file <certificate file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the configs, there are settings for \"LDAP Truststore\" and \"LDAP Truststore Password\". These should be set to match the keystore you imported certificates to.\r\n\r\nI attempted to pull the certs out of the container itself, as well as to use\r\n```\r\necho -n | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 10.0.2.2:33636 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' >> ldapserver.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nin order to get certs. Neither seemed to make SSL happy, I can only assume my sacrificial offerings have been lacking lately.\r\n\r\nThe log error in Vagrant:\r\n```\r\nWarning: no suitable certificate found - continuing without client authentication\r\n*** Certificate chain\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the container gives:\r\n```\r\n5bd1d66c conn=1011 fd=13 ACCEPT from IP=172.17.0.1:35946 (IP=0.0.0.0:636)\r\nTLS: can't accept: No certificate was found..\r\n5bd1d66c conn=1011 fd=13 closed (TLS negotiation failure)\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a negotiation failure, rather than an inability to make it to the handshake, I'm kind of inclined to not troubleshoot it too much here.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/433175628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/433392293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1014#issuecomment-433392293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1014","id":433392293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzM5MjI5Mw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-26T12:33:50Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T12:33:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok,
