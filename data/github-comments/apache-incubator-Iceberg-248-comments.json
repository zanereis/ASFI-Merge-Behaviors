just because incremental read can't use compacted data, doesn't necessarily mean you can't use incremental reads, just that it would potentially be less efficient. How inefficient incremental reads would be would depend largely on how efficiently the data was stored when it was first appended to the Iceberg table. \r\n\r\nWhile querying on a partitioned time column would have the advantage of using compacted files where available, it would come with the disadvantage of having to deal with missing or duplicate results due to any data being ingested late.

This means that Spark does a shuffle (which is expensive) and assigns each partition to a single task (which is observed in your example).\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this is that you get large-sized files, which result in smaller metadata files and reduce the small files problem.\r\n\r\nOne config you can try to speed up the writes is to set `write.distribution-mode` to `None`. This means there is no shuffle, and any task can write to any partition. This can result in a large number of files, which can trigger the small files problem and slower reads. \r\n\r\nI also think there can be an intermediate option, such as setting `write.distribution-mode` to` None` and then repartitioning the data during the Spark write to get more parallelism. You can use `repartition(numPartitions)` or `coalesce(numPartitions)` if applicable, so that you can have more parallelism and still have somewhat larger files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1526757304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1526779646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7430#issuecomment-1526779646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7430","id":1526779646,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bAM7-","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T23:43:52Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T23:43:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can we identify exact scenarios when the default split size performs poorly and check if we can solve the underlying problem?

When I write a large number of datasets to a large number of partitions, because we need to write data to a large number of partitions for each TASK, so each TASK will create a lot of FlieWriter objects, which will quickly lead to the OOM of the job.\r\n2. In the above case, we will create a large number of handles on the server, the load on the server will rapidly increase, and the risk of downtime increases. \r\n3. even if the job can be completed, we will get a bunch of small files, which will lead to a significant drop in performance of analysis tasks based on this table.\r\n\r\nIf I am using HIVE, when I write to the partition table, I tend to do the following.\r\n```\r\ninsert overwrite table partition(part)\r\nselect id,name,part from source_table\r\ndistribute by part  //or distribute by hash(part)%1024\r\n```\r\nThe data is bucketed before it is written to the partition table. Each TASK writes a relatively small number of partitions, so the writes are quite acceptable. \r\nThis SQL statement tends to take longer to run because I redistribute the data.\r\n\r\nWhen `write.distribution-mode=HASH`, ICEBERG works in the same way as the SQL above. \r\nBut the problem is, ICEBERG has hidden partitions, so I can't control the data distribution manually outside. \r\nAnd our jobs are basically SQL jobs, our users can't accept to use SPARK API to redevelop their jobs. \r\nSo now the situation is rather awkward.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1526907138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1526918436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7430#issuecomment-1526918436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7430","id":1526918436,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bAu0k","user":{"login":"singhpk234","id":35593236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTkzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35593236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234","html_url":"https://github.com/singhpk234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-28T03:07:11Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T03:17:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We first find matching files and then plan splits so the split size can be dynamic, we just need a good way to estimate it correctly.\r\n\r\n+1 on @aokolnychyi's suggestion on dynamic split size generation, this would help in solving the problem from both sides small table with a large split size, and large table with a small split size, since iceberg is responsible for the scan planning it's best if it's takes the call itself on how to make these splits.

Do you mean you are fine with the current change but against making it correlate to \"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\"? If so, I am fine with that.\r\n\r\n> Can we identify exact scenarios when the default split size performs poorly and check if we can solve the underlying problem?\r\n\r\nI can share two scenarios, they don't really lead to poor performance, but it made our platform team's life harder (\"harder\" means making migration work more challenging).\r\n\r\n(1) as mentioned above, when SparkSQL used to consume a Hive table with a large \"spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes\" value (for example, 1GB), changing the underlying table to Iceberg (default to 128MB split size) will immediately increase the split count by 8x (in theory), this will lead to driver memory consumption increased and cause job driver OOM. To fix that, we will have to increase driver memory manually for that job.\r\n\r\n(2) we have a strict SLA with we customer, this usually mean when we perform a change to a SparkSQL job (i.e. underlying table from Hive to Iceberg), hopefully we make sure the output are the same (number of files and size of each files). In the case of Iceberg migration, when source table is changed from Hive to Iceberg, due to the split count changes, it will directly increase the SparkSQL job output files by 8x (in theory). While we can further make a case that the increase is OK, but this is making the surface of work larger thus slower down the innovation.

@Fokko I do have a specific question for one of the warnings showing up for mkdocs serve --strict mode. Specifically for iceberg/python/pyiceberg/table/sorting.py. Within the class def for class SortOrder, the comments reference truly a parameter that is not contained within the def __init__(...).
