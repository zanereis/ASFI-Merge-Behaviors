Sorry missed this issue before.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `go get` fetches the code from master which has moved on since the 2.2.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe Pulsar Go code needs to match the same version of `apache-pulsar-client` RPM. \r\n\r\nYou can use `dep ensure -add github.com/apache/pulsar/pulsar-client-go/pulsar@v2.2.0` to force a release version on the Go code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/446764706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/446769164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3166#issuecomment-446769164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3166","id":446769164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Njc2OTE2NA==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-12T22:31:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T22:31:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run

\r\n\r\n> If can't depends on client clock, i think publish time now be client-generated\r\n\r\nYes, as far as I understand publish time is set [here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ProducerImpl.java#L348) this should be set by broker instead of client, do you see any problem in doing so?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify this one step further, I can see two main features with the `delayed message` topic.\r\n\r\n1. Consumer dependent delay (this pr) would be used just to having some delay on _every_ message of the consumer, maybe for short period of times, in the range or less than minutes. And the obvious advantage is that the producer does not need to be aware of such delay.\r\n\r\n2. Publisher dependent delay (#2375 and [here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-26%3A-Delayed-Message-Delivery)) I think this feature is more advance and complex and the proposed way is a really good path, since the time of delay for deliver such messages could be far in time and totally different from each other, therefore, messages need to be structured in consideration with this factor.\r\n\r\nI think both approaches would be great to have on pulsar since they are used for different purposes.\r\n\r\nSo, on 2nd approach we could do what you propose if I'm not wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/446819094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/446830121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3181#issuecomment-446830121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3181","id":446830121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjgzMDEyMQ==","user":{"login":"aahmed-se","id":8009085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se","html_url":"https://github.com/aahmed-se","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-13T03:27:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T03:27:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run
