The part I struggled with is that it randomly picks between `wt` JavaBin, Json, and XML, so I created SolrClients using the builder for each one. Those can be pointed at specific nodes... I just tweaked the Javadocs a bit to try and better explain:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>    * returns a random SolrClient -- either a CloudSolrClient, or an HttpSolrClient pointed at a node\r\n>    * in our cluster.  We have different CLIENTS based on their wt setting for each node.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Honestly, I do find it a bit convoluted.. The test passes, but I don't love it. If you have some ideas on how to make it less convoluted, I'd love that ;-)\r\n\r\nOkay, I've made some changes..

BUT I am not completely convinced this is the correct patch. possibly something could be made better in the `DistributedZkUpdateProcessor` area instead (where a lot of leader calculations are being made but the result is not correct in this edge case).\r\nWhile I am still evaluating a patch for `DistributedZkUpdateProcessor`, I would love some feedback on the observations so far.\r\n\r\nMore on the `isLeader` update: I have decided to only do this in the case where it can be used to avoid throwing an exception. this was to add a best-effort way correct an inconsistent state before bailing out, possibly a cleaner fix would compute the 'isLeader' flag in a way that this approach is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nTogether with the patch I have added a check which will not allow additions with no version. this is now consistent with the delete flows. although I must admit I am confused by the fact that this check was missing on this execution path, while the delete path had this from at least 8 years ago.\r\n\r\nOther points\r\n - in the current test, there are a few operations (add and deletes) that run parallel to the split operation. these can fail and this is where the bug is. because the exceptions are not correctly accounted for, the NPE popped up at a weird place. I added tracking and assertions on this part too (except for deletes, see below)\r\n - deletes can also cause exceptions, I don't have a good handle on how to fix this, so I removed the strict error check. this can be added once the confidence level is higher and this flow is accounted for. until then I will focus on the addition parts.\r\n - DistributedZkUpdateProcessor will call setupRequest twice. this is probably a minor nuisance for some future improvement PR.\r\n - finding the code very hard to read I took the decision to remove one variable that is not really needed (the `updateCommand`), this change is purely cosmetic and I can revert it if it adds too much noise to the current patch.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1492441639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1492444801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1501#issuecomment-1492444801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1501","id":1492444801,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5Y9OaB","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-31T18:50:59Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T18:50:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

I have tried to enable the delete flow as well but was not successful. I left a few TODOs in the code where this is needed. in short: currently the concurrent deletes will be rejected (which is not ideal), this change could make the check less strict by looking at the `isSubShardLeader` (basically using the same code for all flows). trying this approach makes the test fail (from time to time) because there is a delete that is reported successful, but not applied, so the integrity check at the end fails because there are too many documents found.\r\nThe tradeoff is: leave the deletes code 'as-is' and the exceptions untracked vs. update the deletes code, enable all assertions and possibly have this test be flaky (which is today's state, but I can't tell if this would be more flaky or less flaky).\r\n\r\nI think I would prefer to stabilize the 'add doc' flow and then open another PR for the deletes investigation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1493173156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1493249446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1360#issuecomment-1493249446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1360","id":1493249446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5ZAS2m","user":{"login":"vinayakphegde","id":58620771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjIwNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58620771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde","html_url":"https://github.com/vinayakphegde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinayakphegde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-02T07:00:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-02T07:20:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> You forgot [Uwe's comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16642?focusedCommentId=17683095&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17683095) out reverting the `--enable-preview`.

You mentioned in the jira ticket comments that the actual creation and deletion of snapshots was tested elsewhere, so I think just supplying unit tests may be all that's needed here. Spinning up a full cloud test case may be a little overkill! The only issue I haven't tackled yet is that V1 ListSnapshots serialization weirdness.\r\n\r\nI'm still looking into the documentation portion of this work. It may be worth adding the API docs to collection-management.adoc like you mentioned, but I'll need to read through the backup-restore.adoc to see how I'd want to work them into there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1498439957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1499143172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1182#issuecomment-1499143172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1182","id":1499143172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5ZWxwE","user":{"login":"bszabo97","id":79325622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzI1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79325622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97","html_url":"https://github.com/bszabo97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bszabo97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-06T14:19:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T14:19:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"gradle check was successful, I pushed the rebased commits.
