I checked with @nlu90 this afternoon and we believe that this error happens because metrics info is refreshed every one minute, and if you fire up `heron-tracker` and `heron-ui` immediately after you submit the topology, this exception will show up. **If you refresh the UI after one minute you open the `heron-ui/heron-tracker`, you will not see any error message.**\n\nAnother reason that makes me more confident in my conclusion is that @alanngai 's change on `heron.py` is purely syntax level change and involves no change on the semantic of the program. If we really want to consider the above scenario in the above paragraph an issue, we can merge this issue first, and I can submit a new PR to make sure no exception will be thrown even if there is no
