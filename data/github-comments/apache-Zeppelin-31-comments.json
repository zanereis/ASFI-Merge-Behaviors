So vertical bar's color could say about it's output.\nGrey: normal\nOrange: edited\nRed: output contains atleast 1 error\nGreen: output contains no error\n\nWhile we are at it, we could, if possible, have different colors of different lines within the same output.

Question 1 : What's the purpose of ticket ?\n\nI added an implementation note in the security-readme file. It explains why we need a ticket to handle webscoket connections. Basically, it works as follows :\n1. Shiro sits as a servlet filter and protect HTTP requests. That's enough to secure HTTP REST requests.\n2. To secure web sockets connections, we make sure that the user submitted the right credentials on the HTTP REST channel. We do this by issuing a ticket on the HTTP channel (/ticket method) that the browser must submit with each websocket message.\n\n#### Question 2 : Ticket saved in notebook ?\n\nIn this PR( #586) Principal and ticket are not saved in the notebook.\n\n#### Question 3 : What will happen if switching from secure to non secure version and vice-versa\n\nIn this PR( #586). It will work as expected since no change is made to the notebook structure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168367611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/168426954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/586#issuecomment-168426954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/586","id":168426954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODQyNjk1NA==","user":{"login":"jeffsteinmetz","id":5488059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODgwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5488059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffsteinmetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-02T20:44:07Z","updated_at":"2016-01-02T20:44:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"
