This is one of the things I didn't like about it either. However, the modernizer-maven-plugin catches a lot of these, and unless we believe that plugin to be not worth running at all, they will need to be changed. I think we can try to make some of the intent more clear with inline comments, and possibly utility classes that wrap Java internals.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what modernizer-maven-plugin says, there's still value in at least trying to use Java internal stuff, to reduce our use of external libs that could be subject to change between versions. This improves our compatibility/interoperability with other code bases. This change alone won't eliminate the use of Guava, but it could reduce future potential incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n> * A lot of the replacement code is sometimes immutable, but not always.\r\n\r\nI will have to take a look at the specific cases a bit more closely.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something (entirely possible), then Java 11 may have produced different byte code with, and without, the `-release 8` option, even though `-source 1.8` and `-target 1.8` were specified and the animal-sniffer enforcer rule verified the compilation results against Java 1.8. That's very strange, but if it works with the `-release 8` option (which is now automatically added by a profile which is activated when building with javac 9 and later), then I guess all is well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/503794722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/503795758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1221#issuecomment-503795758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1221","id":503795758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzc5NTc1OA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T00:38:01Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T00:40:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The `SecurityOperation` class is currently an internal only class.
