Although record-oriented support may not be required in some cases, introducing this processor without support for a RecordWriter would lock in support for the JSON-specific output.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that it requires some changes, and that a lot of work has already gone into this component, it is also important to consider community maintainability. Components designed for more narrow use cases are difficult to maintain over time, so that's why it can be more difficult to introduce new components. Generating large numbers of small FlowFiles leads to poor flow performance, so that's why it is more important to implement that capability initially, as opposed to introducing it later.

I could find nothing wrong with the expected behavior as well as compatibility issues which were well-thought out. Here are some of the tests I performed:\r\n\r\nChanged this PR's code to modify a controller service (CS), specifically CSVReader, to issue DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR log messages when enabled. Built and installed.\r\n\r\nInstantiated CSVReader within a process group (PG) and set the Bulletin Level to DEBUG\r\nEnabled the CS and observed all four bulletins on the PG's listing of Controller Services. Also observed them on the Bulletin Board.\r\nRepeat, changing the Bulletin Level to INFO, then WARN, then ERROR. All confirmed to behave as expected with bulletin visibility.\r\n\r\nCopy/paste the PG. \r\n > The bulletin level for the CS remained as DEBUG, and behavior confirmed.\r\n\r\nVersion controlled the PG to NiFi Registry of this PR (1.17.0-SNAPSHOT). Then, instantiated the flow from Registry.\r\n > The bulletin level for the CS remained as DEBUG, and behavior confirmed.\r\n\r\nVersion controlled the PG to NiFi Registry, 1.16.1. Then, instantiated the flow from Registry.\r\n > The bulletin level for the CS returned to WARN as expected, and corresponding behavior confirmed.\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility, installed NiFi 1.16.1 placing flow.xml.gz and flow.json.gz in the conf directory (and other required config updates to enable NIFi to start.) NiFi started without issue. CS issued bulletins at the WARN level.\r\n\r\nThe only comment is that TRACE is not an option. However, it is not a Bulletin Level option for processors either, so I think this is fine. If you're interested in TRACE level, you're probably looking at - or have the ability to look at - the log file directly.\r\n\r\n+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1131972414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1132061588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6059#issuecomment-1132061588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6059","id":1132061588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5DeeOU","user":{"login":"NissimShiman","id":57680836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjgwODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57680836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman","html_url":"https://github.com/NissimShiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-19T18:32:31Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T18:32:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A lot of subtle catches.

You've presented one use case where users simply append updated properties at the end of the file. This approach is susceptible to unnoticed configuration errors. Different values represent an ambiguous configuration. A user not in the know will not even be certain if the last property takes precedence or the first - or is it random? The documentation makes no mention of this. Therefore, we are in the gray area requiring the user to assume - never a good position to be in.\r\nThat is largely the point of this ticket: to ensure a well-defined, unambiguous state of the application. I don't find that prospect overly limiting nor ill advised.\r\n\r\nThe use case which brought about this ticket is a user (or maybe it was an automated script.. it's been lost to history a bit) updated nifi.properties in a similar way as you mentioned. However, operators looked at nifi.properties, and specifically looked at the area of the file that is commented and documented to hold certain properties, e.g. \"# security properties #\". Those values were correct, but a new property was added towards the end of the file and was unnoticed.\r\n\r\nSo, we seem to be discussing the valid - or advisable - structure of the nifi.properties file, and the appropriate response of the application. Through this ticket, I would argue that it is not recommended to allow the properties file such wide latitude of property loading. There is very little downside to being more strict, yet potentially costly results for being more lax. I think it is perfectly reasonable to disallow start with the reason being logged. (In fact, failure happens so quickly that the log file is extremely short making it immediately obvious what the problem was.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1134861610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1134902560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6061#issuecomment-1134902560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6061","id":1134902560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5DpT0g","user":{"login":"NissimShiman","id":57680836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjgwODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57680836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman","html_url":"https://github.com/NissimShiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T16:42:55Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T16:42:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested
