There is a method to trim the deleted schemas int the SchemaRegistryServiceImpl. Maybe you can use it directly.\r\n> https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/9d3ab60efddd3f4064789293fd8e9c4d4388b6c7/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/schema/SchemaRegistryServiceImpl.java#L317\r\n\r\nThanks,\"trimDeletedSchemaAndGetList\" is mainly used to get all the schemas and filter out the deleted ones. It is a query method, not really trimming the schema. \r\nIf there is no need to delete Ledger, then I will remove this piece of code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/615892696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/615895321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6732#issuecomment-615895321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6732","id":615895321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTg5NTMyMQ==","user":{"login":"BewareMyPower","id":18204803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower","html_url":"https://github.com/BewareMyPower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-18T16:04:30Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T16:04:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @codelipenghui @merlimat  @jiazhai  @sijie , could you help me with the failure of unit tests?\r\n\r\nI've only changed files under `pulsar-client-cpp` directory, but there're some unrelated tests that can't pass:\r\n\r\n- Integration - Process / process\r\n- Unit - Adaptors / unit-tests\r\n- Unit - Broker Auth SASL / unit-tests\r\n- Unit - Flaky / unit-test-flaky\r\n- Unit - Proxy / unit-tests\r\n- Unit / unit-tests\r\n\r\nThey all failed with `No space left on device`.

rescind the last paragraph. I thought that `pulsar.MessageID`s were being reused, but that was in fact a separate bug in my code :sob:.\r\n\r\nFWIW, while I was debugging, I did manage to work around the issue by creating a new function in `pulsar-client-cpp/lib/c/c_Consumer.cc`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n\r\nvoid pulsar_consumer_acknowledge_async_id_topic(pulsar_consumer_t *consumer, pulsar_message_id_t *messageId,\r\n                                                const char *topic, pulsar_result_callback callback,\r\n                                                void *ctx) {\r\n    std::string t = std::string(topic);\r\n    messageId->messageId.setTopicName(t);\r\n    consumer->consumer.acknowledgeAsync(\r\n        messageId->messageId, std::bind(handle_result_callback, std::placeholders::_1, callback, ctx));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in `pulsar-client-go/pulsar/c_consumer.go`,\r\n\r\n```golang\r\n\r\nfunc (c *consumer) AckIDTopic(msgId MessageID, topic string) error {\r\n\tcTopic := C.CString(topic)\r\n\tdefer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(cTopic))\r\n\tC.pulsar_consumer_acknowledge_async_id_topic(c.ptr, msgId.(*messageID).ptr, cTopic, nil, nil)\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new `AckIDTopic()` does then work, without crashing.
