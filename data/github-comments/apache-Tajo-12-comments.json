There may be mistake in the title. Could you rename the title? \n\nIn these days, TravisCI has been too slow. There have been many pending pull requests for this reason. So, it would be better if you submit the patch to the jira and mark the jira as PATCH AVAILABLE.

If there are any bugs related to `TEXT_DELIMITER`, we must fix it instead of using `CSVFILE_DELIMITER`.\nIn addition, I have a question about the following your description.\n\n```\nWithout this, when two tables, one is 'csvfile.delimiter'=';' and the other has no option, are used in the same query, one is set as TEXT_DELIMITER = ';' and the other is set as TEXT_DELIMITER = '|' and compete for the meta option of the Execution block.\n```\n\nIf only one table is configured with an explicitly different delimiter, two tables must be parsed with different delimiters. If I misunderstand anything, please let me know.\n\nSecond, it is hard to unserstand for me why `CSVFILE_DELIMITER` or `TEXT_DELIMITER` is required to store intermediate results.
