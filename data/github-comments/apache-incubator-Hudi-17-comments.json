Although, ingesting 50 GB of data into Hudi should take no less than 15-30 mins in an average case. We will need a little more information to help you debug the problem : \r\n\r\n1. Can you take a screenshot of the `stages` tab in your Spark UI. Essentially, I'm interested to see what's the shuffle in your stages.\r\n2. Can you tell me how many executors you used to run this ? If you look at the spark properties you linked, the `spark.executor.instances` field doesn't have a value. If you are relying on YARN, the default is 1 executor. You can also see the number of executors by clicking on the executors tab in the Spark UI.\r\n3. Can you please share the hoodie configs ?\r\n\r\nOn a side note, if you are just trying to import your dataset into hudi format, look at this : https://hudi.apache.org/migration_guide.html#approach-2","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/465864131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/465865652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/568#issuecomment-465865652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/568","id":465865652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTg2NTY1Mg==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-21T05:19:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T05:19:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dimejune13 The error you describe does seem like there is some sort of BLOCK replication issue in HDFS, for example a file/block becomes under replicated if 1 or more nodes go down depending on your replication factor; it doesn't look like a version issue since it's intermittently working for you.

Let's try to dig a little further into each of these : \r\n\r\n1. Performance Bug -> Have you tried to run a comparison of a non-hudi dataset (just a plain hive table for example) on HDFS vs S3 ? I'd like to understand if there's an inherent slowness of HDFS vs S3.\r\n\r\n2. Just to be clear, is the EMRFs an issue with EMRFileSystem initialization and not Hudi ?\r\n\r\n3. The intermittent issue is a good catch. The problem is due to this line [https://github.com/uber/hudi/blob/master/hoodie-client/src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/io/HoodieCreateHandle.java#L156](here). Since S3 is eventually consistent, sometimes, the filegetstatus(..) does not find the path and throws this exception. We have consistency checks for S3 at the end of the write before publishing the commit, this is a corner case and should be addressed. Could you please open a bug for this ?\r\n\r\n4. Although the exception you see is due to `concurrent modification`, the underlying issue is likely different, seems like a Kryo serlialization issue when serializing array list types (a known issue with kryo).

We have been monitoring our cluster for 7 days and the error never appeared again.\r\n\r\nOur guess (really, just a guess) is that this issue is caused by some kind of unclean thread shutdown from a killed or stopped query, causing FSDataInputStream to still be opened to HDFS and causing any hudi query submitted the next time to always get the error. Just to confirm our report before, the issue is intermittent in a sense that: the first error might appear intermittently (we cannot predict the time it appears the first time), but once it appeared, any hudi query submitted after will always get the same error. After this point, the only way to solve it is to restart our presto coordinator. So for example:\r\n````\r\n12.00: the presto cluster is up after restarted \r\n12.00 - 12.30: any hudi query always succeeded \r\n12.31: the first error appeared\r\n12.31 - 12.45: any hudi query always threw the error\r\n12.45: restarted the presto coordinator, and presto cluster is up again.\r\n12.45 - ...: any hudi query always succeeded \r\nand the loop continue.\r\n````\r\nAnswering @n3nash 's question regarding the hadoop fsck, yes. We have done hadoop fsck command targeting the folder that contains the data and metadata partition file, and the result has always been HEALTHY. We did this both before and after the issue appeared on the presto cluster.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @n3nash and @vinothchandar for taking the time to look into this issue, and @bhasudha along with @vinothchandar for the commit.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it here in case someone else encounter the same problem in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/468560561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/468738480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/590#issuecomment-468738480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/590","id":468738480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODczODQ4MA==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T17:10:46Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T17:10:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rahuledavalath :  As mentioned in https://github.com/uber/hudi/blob/687395e40f71f12f130640a9db048bea77a20d8c/hoodie-common/src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/common/table/log/HoodieLogFormatWriter.java#L236\r\n\r\nthis is a corner case when spark retries a failed task too quickly before the lease is yielded or when the data-node expires.

But if we really want kryo to use them then we can always register this class to use instead JavaSerializer() using \"spark.kryo.registrator\" spark config.\r\n\r\nDetails of kryo serialization performance are here. https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/468868205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/468868787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/591#issuecomment-468868787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/591","id":468868787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODg2ODc4Nw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T01:45:26Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T01:45:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is this just a spark issue?
