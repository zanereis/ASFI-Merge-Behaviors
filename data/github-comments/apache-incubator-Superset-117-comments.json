oh man. Good catch. I had forgotten that the `query_obj` contains the `form_data`. It's used for templating use case the user is using a tempalted SQL query (a Superset view), coming from SQL Lab.\r\n\r\nNow I still think this is the right high level approach, but that we need to mitigate the templating use case somehow. Maybe have users opt-in on passing the `form_data` (?). Perhaps a new Slice boolean \"allow form_data templating\". Templating brings potentially other problems around things being non-deterministic...

I took a look at the latest code and I do think that the new caching method would be useful for us to implement said feature.\r\n\r\nI am currently thinking of adding a param to the cache to allow us to add determine the `layer` of data that is cached, e.g. Dataframe level, Payload-data level. \r\n\r\nDoing this should enable cache to work with the csv download, while not affecting the other features at the same time. We can reconsider the caching layer for the existing features some other time.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other feedback or suggestion for this idea?\r\n\r\nI will work on trying to getting the cache to
