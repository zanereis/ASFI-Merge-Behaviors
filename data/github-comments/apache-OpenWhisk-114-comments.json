resource not recovered problem`\r\nfirst execute `docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)`, then, `wskN_N_prewarm_nodejs6` containers will not be removed because it is `paused` status, next execute `systemctl restart docker` to delete  `wskN_N_prewarm_nodejs6` containers, then, we can see `network resource not recovered problem` appeared again.\r\n\r\n#### 3.How to solve above problem?\r\n* don't  execute `docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)` on invoker nodes manually.\r\nif executed above cmd, please execute `docker-runc resume XXX` to delete the `wskN_N_prewarm_nodejs6` containers.\r\n* normal actions is that first execute `docker stop invokerN`, then, execute `docker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)`\r\n\r\n#### 4.Conclusion\r\nWhen deploy/redeploy the invoker before, if we promise that the invoker node's network resource is recovered, above problem will gone.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/359349184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/359521936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3202#issuecomment-359521936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3202","id":359521936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTUyMTkzNg==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-22T18:38:56Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T18:38:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey
