think there may be a LOT of other issues with the Docker version of Zeppelin.   For example, I wanted to go ahead and use the installer script, and discovered that since my plugin isn't yet on Maven Central (it's a fresh SNAPSHOT of the solr interpreter) that the install script wouldn't work.   I also tried the -artifact approach, but didn't have luck with that.  Partly because I don't quite understand how it works, and maybe because of the mismatch between a local development environment and being able to install local dependencies and attempting to do it in Docker environment.   \r\n\r\nLastly, and maybe most importantly, I still don't see the logs being written out either.  I mucked around with manually creating that directory, but still no luck there.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the direction I am going down isn't really viable, and hoping that maybe there is a better
