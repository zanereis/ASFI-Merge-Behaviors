for the late review @ChengXiangLi. I finished it now and the PR looks really good. \n\nThere is only one thing I would like to change before merging it. This is to move the `sample` and the `sampleWithSize` methods from the `DataSet` to the `DataSetUtils` class. This will effectively make the `sample` methods not part of the core API. The reason for this is that the `sampleWithSize` method breaks with one of Flink's guarantees, which is the robustness of the core API functions against `OutOfMemoryExceptions`. Let me elaborate on it for better understanding.\n\nAll of Flink internal operations work on serialized data which is stored in Flink's _managed_ memory. The managed memory allows Flink to detect when to spill elements from memory to disk to avoid out of memory exceptions and, thus, to make the system robust. The managed memory is a pre-allocated area of memory which is administered by the `MemoryManager`. The `MemoryManager` allows you to allocate and deallocate `MemorySegments` in a c-style fashion. However, once a data item enters a UDF, the item has to be deserialized putting it on the remaining heap. This is not bad if your UDF does not accumulate these elements. However, the `sampleWithSize` method materializes up to `numSamples` elements on the heap. Depending on the number of samples and the data item size, this might be enough to eat up all remaining heap memory space and to crash the JVM.\n\nI think that your current implementation will work for most use cases but in order to make it part of the core API, we also have to deal with the case where our sample cannot be materialized on the remaining heap of a running Flink program. In order to achieve this, I think it would be necessary to implement a native `topK` operator. With _native_ I mean an operator which works on Flink's managed memory and, thus, can also deal with spilling records to disk. Having such a `topK` operator, we could reimplement the reservoir sampling algorithm the following way: For sampling without replacement we first assign weights in a map operation to each element. Then we call topK with respect to the weights and obtain the sample. For the sampling with replacement we could simply use a flat map operation to assign `numSamples` times a weight to each element. Then we again call `topK` with respect to the weight.\n\nFor the topK implementation, we would need something like a `PriorityQueue` which operates on managed memory (similar to the `CompactingHashTable` which is a hash table working on managed memory). Thus, we would have a priority queue which stores the priority values of each record and a pointer to the record which is kept in managed memory. Whenever an element is removed from the priority queue, we can also free the occupied managed memory. In case that we run out of managed memory, we have to spill some of the records to disk which are still in the race for the top k. As a first step, we can skip the spilling and just throw a proper exception (other than `OutOfMemoryException`) when we run out of memory. Afterwards, we can incrementally add the spilling functionality.\n\nI know that you've already spent a lot of effort into writing the sampling operator and that this result might be a little bit demotivating. However, if we want to make it right and robust, then I think this is the way to go. Additionally we would add a proper topK operator to Flink's API which is missing big time :-) If you want to, then you could also take the lead here. The further discussion should then happen in a separate issue. I'm more than willing to assist you in implementing this operator. What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/132692640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/132704210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1031#issuecomment-132704210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1031","id":132704210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjcwNDIxMA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-19T17:26:26Z","updated_at":"2015-08-19T17:26:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A call to clear cache files does not hurt, but let's fix the MultipleProgramsTest base to produce fresh ExecutionEnvironments in its factory, rather than repeatedly handing out the same one.

As the owner of this issue, make it work correctly and  efficiently is my top desire, so i would never say no to a reasonable and proper suggestion(although i did expect it happens earlier :-)). `OutOfMemoryError` is one of my concern during the implementation as well, unlimited usage of Java heap is unacceptable, so i limit the reservoir size(`PriorityQueue` size in implementation) same as `numSamples` parameter, which give the user full control of the memory used in java heap for `sample` operator. It may lead to `OutOfMemoryError` if the `numSamples` is too large, but other operators may lead to `OutOfMemoryError` as well if user cache too much objects inside UDF.

You'll find many classes in Flink which define methods which are not used by itself. It's part of the idea of OOP that the methods you define on a class constitute the interface to it. Thus, it defines what you can do with it. In that sense, `makeQualified` should stay part of the `Path` class, because it allows you to create a qualified path object from another path object.\n\nMoreover, scattering functionality around in some static util classes won't make it easier for others to actually find it. How should people know that there is a class `FileSystemUtil` which allows you to convert paths into qualified paths? It's more natural to look at the methods defined in the `Path` class. Having much code in one class is not per se bad if you structure it clearly and if your methods don't become behemoths it's fine. I also don't think that @fhueske had this in mind when he created the JIRA issue.\n\nMaybe I'm totally wrong here, but I think we should close this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/133340112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/133358126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1036#issuecomment-133358126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1036","id":133358126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzM1ODEyNg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-21T09:51:02Z","updated_at":"2015-08-21T09:51:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, the github mirror is out of sync again -

Using a `TreeMap` and `PriorityQueue` with invalidation, I've managed to bring down the complexity of the `add` and `merge` operations to logarithmic time. Further, `quantile` and `count` are also linear only, as they should be.\nFurther, I've decided to put both the Histograms in the `accumulator` package since they're supposed to work like one anyway. There already was a _discrete_ histogram in the `accumulator` package. The _continuous_ one now resides in the same place.\nAlso, the `DataSetUtils` class now contains functions to create histograms, providing access to these classes from the Java api itself instead of the ML library. That was needed to be done sooner or later. Flink-2274 actually asks for that. \n@thvasilo @chiwanpark

It doesn't seem to serve its purpose. I tried sampling with fraction three times with the same seed, however, every time I get different results. \nI've been stuck on this problem myself for quite some time. The fix is, instead of `seed + index`, you should just use `seed`. But then, the sample is not truly random. Far as I could figure out, splits of data don't arrive at the exactly same index subtask every time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134070592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/134070893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/949#issuecomment-134070893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/949","id":134070893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDA3MDg5Mw==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-24T07:22:21Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T07:22:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@thvasilo, the PR did not yet include the proper sampling behaviour within iterations.
