The default distributed RPC port is 55560. I see that you have found the answer to this question.\r\n2. For cluster version testing, we generally use the support_ cluster branch[1] for testing, and the master is not used for the cluster version.\r\n> Interestingly when I ingest more data only node1's data folder size is getting larger than node2 and node3 ones.\r\n> This means data is actually stored only under the node1 data folder.\r\n3. About node1's data folder size is getting bigger than node2 and node3. Because the default copy is 2 copies, and the data is partitioned according to storage group name + time, it is not possible to guarantee the same size of the data on the three nodes. You can use this tool[1] to look at data partitioning. \r\n> Lots of \"TTransportException: null\" exceptions seen on logs.\r\n4. Yes, there are a large number of errors in the currently distributed version, but it does not affect the normal operation and can be ignored for the time being.

could I know which version were you trying? \r\n\r\nI tried to create timeseries with path `root.sg.d1.\"C:\\\"` on `0.12-snapshot` and got an error message `Msg: 315: The timeseries name contains unsupported character. root.sg.d1.\"C:\\\" is not a legal path`.\r\n\r\nI do know why this error thrown. We have a `ID_MATCHER` field in IoTDBConfig class. If the path node name doesn't match this, the creating will fail. \r\n\r\nAlso, antlr will check if the name is following the rule defined in SqlBase.g4 when create timeseries using JDBC api.\r\n\r\nBTW, the matcher and the antlr rule need to be updated indeed.
