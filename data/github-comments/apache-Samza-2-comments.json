Where was it introduced?  \r\n\r\nAs a part of JobModelManager refactoring, I added coordinatorStreamConsumer.stop, coordinatorStreamProducer.stop  in the finally block of JobModelManager.apply method. \r\n\r\nReason for doing it : These resources(coordinatorStreamConsumer, coordinatorStreamProducer) were created in the apply method and most of them goes out of scope after the method execution. \r\n\r\nWith the intent to handle the lifecycle and free up resources, this change was done. \r\n\r\nA BrokerProxy thread is spawned for each KafkaSystemConsumer creation. \r\n\r\nAnd a KafkaSystemConsumer is created for each call to JobModelManager.apply. After the completion,  kind of felt this is unnecessary to leave this thread open, when it will be unused.\r\n\r\n> What is the actual cause of this? Why was messages are not read till highest watermark offset? \r\n\r\nIn jobModel creation, localityManager is passed in as a parameter and is used for reading ContainerLocality mappings.\r\n\r\nPassing in a live resource(that holds open socket connections, threads) to a pojo object that should’ve been immutable kinds of now creates a global state dependency. \r\n\r\nSince the reference to both coordinatorStreamConsumer, coordinatorStreamProducer is held indirectly through jobModel(a client which has jobModel reference can get stale data if getContainerLocality is invoked after coordinatorStreamConsumer.close), it doesn’t make sense to stop them just after generating the jobModel.\r\n\r\nIn SamzaContainerProcessManager.start, we read containerToHostMappings from the jobModel, which in turn uses localityManager to read from it. \r\n\r\nSince the systemConsumer is closed after the job model creation , this read containerLocality just returns the messages to be returned only from the KafkaConsumer cache.\r\n\r\n \r\n> Ideal fix would entail doing the following. \r\n\r\n* To handle lifecycle properly, should be just passing the container locality map(map<String, map<String, String>) in jobModel constructor during creation, which is beyond the scope of this patch. \r\n* Fixing the BalancingTaskNameGrouper interface which takes in localityManager. Since samza users can indirectly reference(coordinatorStreamConsumer, coordinatorStreamProducer)   in their taskNameGrouper implementation and can have logic based upon that.

Before I respond to your comments, can you please move the description of the problem and its proposed solution to a JIRA? PR is not a place to be doing root-cause analysis. Please read [the docs](http://samza.apache.org/contribute/contributors-corner.html#contributing-to-apache-samza)\r\n\r\n>  when we stop coordinatorStreamConsumer after jobModel is generated in JobModelManager, future reads from the coordinatorStream in AM doesn’t read until the highest watermark offset.\r\n\r\nWhich component is doing the \"future reads\" ? Afaik, the leader creates the JobModel and exposes it using the HTTP end-point. even though the goal is for the leader to continuously catch-up with coordinator stream, I don't believe we are doing that yet. Correct me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\n>In jobModel creation, localityManager is passed in as a parameter and is used for reading ContainerLocality mappings.\r\n> \r\n> Passing in a live resource(that holds open socket connections, threads) to a pojo object that should’ve been immutable kinds of now creates a global state dependency.\r\n\r\nAgreed. \r\n\r\n>  it doesn’t make sense to stop them just after generating the jobModel.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense. But how are you proposing to fix this? Not handling life-cycle within JobModelManager and pushing it up to the callers is a fine model too. It doesn't look like that is what is in the patch though.\r\n\r\n> To handle lifecycle properly, should be just passing the container locality map(map<String, map<String, String>) in jobModel constructor during creation, which is beyond the scope of this patch.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you have identified a real issue here. However, I disagree on the fix being outside the scope of this patch. In fact, this PR seems to have identified a good deal of issues we have. But it doesn't address any of them, leaving behind loopholes. -1 on the scoping of the issue/patch\r\n\r\n> This interface needs to change before we can conclusively say lifecycle of this resource is now done.\r\n\r\nIt is not straightforward to change a public interface.

This complication was introduced because of how jobModel was constructed which existed much prior to JobModelManager refactoring.\r\n\r\nIt is awesome that you have identified a crucial bug/issue. Rather than taking it back to the broken state that it was, I prefer to fix it forward. \r\n\r\n> Just a interim solution to unblock @xinyuiscool testing, before we fix it properly.\r\n\r\nWhat part of this fix is @xinyuiscool blocked on?\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't understand the basis behind the solution in this PR. -1 for this change.

Code associated with them aren't modified for ages. @xinyuiscool can correct me here, if i'm wrong. Despite that we're seeing failures. Success/Failure of individual tests depends upon proper initialization of shared global state in before method.  In parallel execution of tests, assignments can get interleaved leading to race conditions. \r\n\r\nAs a fix I've moved object hierarchy construction to individual test methods & local build's green.\r\n\r\n> Why does the test setup invoke task.process more than once when EOS message is used?\r\n\r\nI should have phrased that better. \r\n\r\nThere's a lag between processing last message & shutting the executor down in tests(This was allowed since in some runs executor is shutdown before task threads complete). Due to which, the last value returned by the mock will be the value it returns throughout the lag period(this is how mocks work). So it keeps on hitting task.process method with that EOS message. When chooser returns null as last value(instead of EOS), AsyncRunLoop doesn’t hit task instances(hence the change).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/291389862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/291649713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/110#issuecomment-291649713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/110","id":291649713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTY0OTcxMw==","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-04T22:16:20Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T22:16:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jmakes and @prateekm : please take a look at this patch.

As we discussed, NodeId is the ID for either operator node or stream node, and it is used to construct the topology of the graph.

Each node has a reference of the other in the pair. I updated the link to the example json.

It receives others from external sources like the task assignment manager. I was only suggesting that the latter should be validated s.t. we throw an exception rather than letting unexpected/undefined behavior occur.\r\n\r\nYeah. I agree we can test the latter. The place where you had added the comment threw me off. It should probably be in getPreviousContainers, where we readTaskAssignment.\r\n\r\n> Also, I believe this is not equivalent to integer comparison.\r\nIn a sort scenario, for the same id's:\r\nInteger comparison would yield [3, 8, 10]\r\nString comparison would yield [10, 3, 8]\r\nWe should be certain that this will not affect any other code that uses ContainerModel as a comparator. e.g. for sort. If that code expects them to be in integer order for example, it could break. Or it could produce inconsistent behavior, different mappings of anything that is assigned to containers in a round-robin fashion.\r\n\r\nI totally agree that comparison between Integer and String will result in different order. I am actually not even sure if \"comparable\" even makes sense anymore. I am trying to figure out where in our code we rely on \"ordering\" or \"sorting\" of ContainerModels. I couldn't find any use-case for this. \r\nIn fact, I removed it and ran a build and it seems to work fine.

Now the logic should be much cleaner.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on refactoring the interaction between StreamProcessor/JobCoordinator/Container. I think the goal is for the StreamProcessor to listen to JobCoordinator events and accordingly, manage the container lifecycle. This way, we de-couple jobcoordinator from container lifecycle. While it makes sense for processorId to come from StreamProcessor to make it for LocalApplicationRunner, I think the change to JobCoordinatorFactory to include processorId is incorrect and should have been called out explicitly in the PR. \r\n\r\nIn future, please document motivations for changing samza-core apis as well. It impacts other developers relying on the samza-core interface. \r\n\r\nIn general, please seek for explicit approvals from committers who have explicitly given a -1 in the PR before committing the code. While it defies the general [commit policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#votes-on-code-modification) followed in Apache projects, more importantly, it impacts the productivity of other project developers, and ultimately, the progress of the project itself.

Only exception is the one involving the boolean flag. Replacing it with the enum makes it easy to read. But I don't think we have clear values for the enum - except for JobCoordinator. \r\nOn second thought, would it be better to keep a separate method called \"pause\" in SamzaContainer and that is used to set the paused flag. The benefit of this approach is: \r\n1. It will be more readable and we won't semantically overload the shutdown method\r\n2.
