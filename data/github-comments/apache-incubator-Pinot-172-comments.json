And I agree with @snleee that we shouldn't introduce another knob/api for this. \r\n\r\nMore to the point, I don't think linkedin should be using those metrics in the current state at least. They are bound to be inaccurate unless there is an external mechanism in linkedin that can ensure that no topic is consumed by more than 1 pinot table. Moreover, all our spis accept clientId in their interfaces and there is no way currently to customize it. \r\n\r\nAnyway, let's wait for @jugomezv to confirm. Tks all for jumping in!
