you know, sitting in a hotel room and being forced to build using my Macbook (which has 8 cores but also only 8GB of ram) ... what would, in fact, be nice would be to simply have the integration test

`userMaxForks` and `userMaxITForks` with:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nmaxParallelForks = userMaxITForks ?: (userMaxForks ?: Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors())\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least, to me personally this
