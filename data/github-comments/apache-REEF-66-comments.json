This change is way too big. It literally crashed the browser tab when I tried to do a code review.\n\nThere is also limited documentation on the design. Hence, I will comment on that here in the hopes that a set of smaller commits can replace this one.\n\nThe code seems to overspecialize on the case of combining the local runtime with another one. The configuration builder goes so far as to expose specific options of the local runtime again in methods. This seems unnecessary to me, as we already have ways to configure each runtime. I was hoping for a multi runtime layer that would allow for the generic combination of any runtime. That should not only be more general, but also much simpler from a code perspective.\n\nIn terms of breaking this change down into a set of smaller commits that each have a specific focus, how about the following:\n1. Introduce multi-runtime API with support for 0 actual runtimes. That commit should introduce the new interfaces for the user of the multi runtime as well as the new interfaces for runtimes that would like to take part in a multi-runtime setup. Tests in this commit can validate invariants of the multi-runtime APIs.\n2. Add support for the local runtime to take part in a multi-runtime setup. In this commit, we can also add a new launcher for `HelloREEF` that uses the multiruntime in this configuration.\n3. Add support for the yarn runtime to take part in a multi-runtime setup. We can expand the test and `HelloREEF` coverage in this commit.\n4. Add support for the HDI runtime as above.\n\nI expect step 1 in this plan to be the most review-heavy, but it is also a cheap way to evade the need for a lengthy design plan discussion. I find it easier to discuss code than design docs, but this PR as presented is just too much.\n\n@shulmanb Do you think that sequence of events is feasible? Or is there another that makes more sense?\n\n@afchung You've had a chance to look at the code, is the above reasonable? I'm making this up in the void, after all :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213573065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213573400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/960#issuecomment-213573400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/960","id":213573400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzU3MzQwMA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T20:08:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T20:08:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm doing another pass.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213573400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213573936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/960#issuecomment-213573936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/960","id":213573936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzU3MzkzNg==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T20:11:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T20:11:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, @jwang98052?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213573936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213578309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/963#issuecomment-213578309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/963","id":213578309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzU3ODMwOQ==","user":{"login":"dkm2110","id":151031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110","html_url":"https://github.com/dkm2110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T20:29:32Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T20:29:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"jwang98052 some of major concerns/questions have been answered by @tcNickolas .

As long as the JIRA and commit message make it clear how it all fits together, separating along the language boundary makes sense.\n\n> Current implementation does not specialized on yarn/local, the reason builder supports only these two is that nothing else is supported on the c# layer, \n\nThat is fair. However, leaking local runtime configuration parameters to the multi runtime builder is dangerous, as we now have to pay attention to the multi runtime when changing the local runtime. This tight coupling will become an issue.\n\nHence, my suggestion is to make the multi-runtime agnostic to the specific runtime, and expose APIs that a runtime needs to implement to take part in the multi-runtime setup.

Previously our code supported only the second one, with the proposed change it would support only the first one. I think we should support both.\n\nWe can have two log level fields: one static and one per instance. They can be set independently, and when a message arrives to be logged, it is logged if either of level fields dictates it to be logged. Or per instance field could have priority, if it was set explicitly instead of staying on default value.\n\nWhat do you
