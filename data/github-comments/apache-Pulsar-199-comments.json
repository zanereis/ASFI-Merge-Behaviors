Without having looked at the implementation, it seems like the fix would be to not have the negative ack remove the message from the unack message tracker if that message processing has already timed out?\r\n\r\nI also did a bit of additional testing to confirm the actual consequences, and it seems there is a difference whether partitioned or non-partitioned topics are used.\r\n\r\nIf using partitioned topics (with just 1 partition), the consumer gets completely stuck and no further messages will be processed by the consumer (and the message will not be put on the DLQ). That seems like a serious bug. Furthermore, I can consistently reproduce this in a test case, but in a real setup, this is likely to only happen rarely, making it way harder to track down the source of the issue.\r\n\r\nIf using non-partitioned topics the redelivery-count is just messed up and the message correctly ends up on the DLQ, so that is less serious.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/594616979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/594626472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6356#issuecomment-594626472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6356","id":594626472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDYyNjQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"congbobo184","id":39078850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDc4ODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39078850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184","html_url":"https://github.com/congbobo184","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/congbobo184/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-04T16:00:27Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T16:00:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/594626472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/594678993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6468#issuecomment-594678993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6468","id":594678993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDY3ODk5Mw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-04T17:22:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T17:22:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Confirmed that this behavior doesn't exist in pre-2.5.0 release.

Assumptions like  \"Any resource operation should be managed/authorized by the resource which owns it.\" and  \"ClusterOperations should manage Tenants, TenantOperation should manage Namespaces, etc. Hierarchical approach\" it only makes me think that is being designed for some other system, which is not Pulsar. \r\n\r\nPulsar has no operational hierarchy beyond  tenants. It is not designed for namespace admins or topic admins. The premise of pulsar is that a tenant manages all its namespaces. There are  operations that can be logically managed at the namespace and topic level, but that is a convenience for the tenant admin.
