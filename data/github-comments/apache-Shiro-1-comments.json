looking at the question about `#calculatePath()`, I checked the rules for path matching for browsers, and found an edge case: the logic would accept a prefix that is not a complete path, for example it would accept requests from '/foobar/something.jsp' as matching for the cookie with a path of '/foo'.

spent some time looking into this.  I think it is a bigger issue API wise in shiro-guice.\n\nThe current proposal is great for a starting point!,  The one problem I have with it, is it does NOT allow for custom `PathMatchingFilter`.  And one cannot extend `FilterConfigKey` because it is private.\n\nI _think_ the root of the problem is the [`addFilterChain`](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/samples/guice/src/main/java/org/apache/shiro/samples/guice/SampleShiroServletModule.java#L59) method, which provides a nice fluid interface, but mixes `Keys` and Key with configuration string (`FilterConfigKey`).  As far as I can tell (from this thread), extending `Key` is not a good idea...\n\nI think the solution is going to require a few new methods, namely something that replaces [`addFilterChain`](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/support/guice/src/main/java/org/apache/shiro/guice/web/ShiroWebModule.java#L230-L233)\n\nSeeing how the Guice 4 path is most likely backwards compatible with Guice 3, we should be able to add/extend a class, and deprecate the old API (and remove it in 2.0)\n\nWe _could_ create methods similar to:\n\n``` java\nvoid addFilterChain(String pattern, SomeConfigBean... configBeans) // general use\n```\n\nBut... then you end up with something not as easy to read as the original (IMHO)\n\n``` java\n// original\naddFilterChain(\"/remoting/**\", AUTHC, config(ROLES, \"b2bClient\"), config(PERMS, \"remote:invoke:lan,wan\"));\n\n// new \naddFilterChain(\"/remoting/**\", config(AUTHC), config(ROLES, \"b2bClient\"), config(PERMS, \"remote:invoke:lan,wan\"));\n```\n\nBut I could be over thinking this, thoughts?\n\ncc: \n@kaosko\n@

Thus I would like to help with given task. We looked into `pax-shiro-cdi-web` and `pax-shiro-cdi` and have ideas how to make them even more CDI-oriented, without need for `shiro-web` dependency, e.g. own `Environment` implementation etc. I guess I will start with pulling of existing changes and see how to add our improvements there.\n\nRegards,\nDmytro\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/249107754/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/249586611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/38#issuecomment-249586611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/38","id":249586611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTU4NjYxMQ==","user":{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-26T14:31:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-26T14:31:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"merged

thanks!\n\nIs there an easy way we can test the features file (and bundle configs).  These pull requests are a great help, but I'd like to see how we can better test for these things.\n\n(or a example app we can use to run a basic IT against)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/254213735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/256120357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/32#issuecomment-256120357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/32","id":256120357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjEyMDM1Nw==","user":{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-25T18:18:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T18:18:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cleaned

I don't see any use case where `FirstSuccessfulStrategy` in its current form adds value. Its behavior needs to be changed. As you had suggested, its better to build this behavior into `FirstSuccessfulStrategy` itslef, controlled through a boolean, rather then introducing a new strategy.  \r\n\r\nAlso was thinking if adding `FirstNSuccessfulStrategy` & `AtLeastNSuccessfulStrategy` to have min of 2, 3, ... n successful authentications would be beneficial.

I had a similar problem when working on the Stormpath Shiro integration, and used a [ShiroPrioritizedFilterChainResolver](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-shiro/blob/master/extensions/servlet/src/main/java/com/stormpath/shiro/servlet/filter/ShiroPrioritizedFilterChainResolver.java) which is configured with a set of filters that will execute before any path filters.  So in this case, it would probably look something like:\r\n\r\n``` ini\r\n[main]\r\n# enable hsts\r\nssl.hsts.enabled = true\r\n\r\n# All paths go through ssl filter\r\npriorityFilter.filters = ssl\r\n\r\n[urls]\r\n/** = authc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, this is not part of Shiro at the moment, and I think this pull request can be completed independent of this, but it may help both with your other question:\r\n\r\nThe issue with the path configuration of the ssl filter and path, does seem odd, but I think this solution makes it easier to configure and explain/configure.
