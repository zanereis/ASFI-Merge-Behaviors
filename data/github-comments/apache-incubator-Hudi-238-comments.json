I also encountered this issue, in my case upgrading to 0.9.0 and setting `parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure` to false helped both for MOR and COW table. When using 0.8.0 issue still persists.\r\n> \r\n> In my case I had two problems:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Schema evolution in complex type column from `array<struct<col1>>` to `array<struct<col1, col2>>`, when reading col2 should be null for the first record, hudi was failing to read table.\r\n> 2. While doing upserts, the scenario was like this: do initial load with  `array<struct<col1>>`, upsert records with exact same data. Hudi was creating avro file with different type for this column: `array<string>`. It was failing at avro parquet schema conversion, hive sync was failing also because of the schema change.\r\n\r\n@kazdy can you please share the environment details which you used while fixing this issue, since we are facing still facing it  wanted to confirm if its due to the configurations.
