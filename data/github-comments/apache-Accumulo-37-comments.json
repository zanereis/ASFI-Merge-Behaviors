In order to just use separate config files, we would have to go through and scrub for those and ensure every set property is in the configs appropriately (at least for those that are tserver related). Granted, this is our problem, not accumulo's.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to me that not having a mechanism for dealing with this in the config shell commands leads to ambiguous behavior, or at least changes what the intuitive definition of \"site\" is. For instance, when connected to one tserver, would config -f <property> output that value in that tservers configuration under the \"site\" layer? That leads me, as the user, to believe that is for this entire accumulo instance, but that is not the case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/510675412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/510686342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1265#issuecomment-510686342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1265","id":510686342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDY4NjM0Mg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T23:11:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T23:11:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree that some improvements to the shell to make the runtime config of a given tserver query-able would be a welcome improvement.
