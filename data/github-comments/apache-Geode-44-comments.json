To keep all discussion in a single location, I'll summarize my comment here:\r\n  I am uncomfortable with the syntax `alter runtime --statistic-archive-file=` where no value follows \r\n  the equals sign. I would like to see comments from the Apache Geode developers' mailing list on this \r\n  proposal.\r\nHowever, I am also uncomfortable with this latest change. If I understand it correctly, to enable this property, the value following the equals sign must be a filename with one of two suffixes: '.gfs' or '.gz'. Any other string disables the archive-to-a-file function.\r\nI find this counterintuitive. In my opinion:\r\nThe simplest way to add a turn-off function to this existing property would be to specify an empty string, using a syntax you suggested earlier: `alter runtime --statistic-archive-file=\"\"`.\r\nIf that isn't workable, then (again, my opinion) the next best approach would be to add a boolean option that sets statistics archiving to 'true' or 'false'. \r\nAgain, I would like to see this put to the dev list for additional thoughts.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/576394007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/577467413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4408#issuecomment-577467413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4408","id":577467413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzQ2NzQxMw==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T01:44:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T01:44:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging 47893d0caacd7aa416e48ccb99f70ee1d358c701 into 98e75f4acfea3d5ecf5630429899aa20fd3b21cd -

Hi,\r\n> \r\n> can you share some info regarding this internal tests, so we can speed up detection of problem in this PR?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks\r\n\r\nHi Mario,\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the internal test is to force async message queueing and confirm that no deadlocks occur. The test in question starts 6 servers with 5 regions in the cluster, each using a custom CacheListener that sleeps the thread for 2 ms when onCreate() is called with a particular event key in order to encourage queueing. Random events are delivered to the regions, including ones using the key that will trigger a 2ms sleep.\r\n\r\nEach server is configured to run with 5 threads, conserve sockets is set to true, async distribution timeout is 5ms, async queue timeout is 60000ms and async max queue size is 10.\r\n\r\nWe consistently see the test hang when two members log that they are sleeping due to the onCreate() listener call. If only one member has logged that call then the test continues regardless of how many times its called, but as soon as a second member logs it, the test encounters problems and a hang is declared 5 minutes later.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to investigate this issue after the weekend, but I hope that the information here is helpful to you in the meantime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/589973406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/590198698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4726#issuecomment-590198698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4726","id":590198698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDE5ODY5OA==","user":{"login":"mivanac","id":48509724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac","html_url":"https://github.com/mivanac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-24T07:41:45Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T07:41:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
