Thanks for your comment. I didn't notice these two rules before.

This way you can control when `RestClient` is closed.\r\n\r\n@asereda-gs I can see if we can lift the rest client management out to Drill but do you really want to retain the situation where this library creates internal objects that allocate OS resources and never calls `close()` on them, either of its own accord or in response to some message from the application?\r\n\r\nSurely that's just bad library code and now we're arguing \"Yes it leaks but applications that are in a position to to do a lot of reuse can make that a slow, perhaps even a bounded leak.  Alternatively they can forgo using the API in the obvious way, i.e. figure out not to use the factory class, and do their own resource management.  So we don't need to fix the library\"?  You have to think that there are probably many applications out there using Calcite with slow resource leaks today as a result.\r\n\r\nOr, if Calcite really doesn't want to have to free rest clients itself then either the factory should change to ask the application to provide them or Schema change to extend AutoCloseable so that the application can close schema objects (which can close rest clients if they have them).  Maybe one of these is a better idea, because the cache in this PR doesn't work perfectly.  A cache that falls into disuse results in a bounded leak because it has no reaper thread, while an application that creates its own class loaders could still in theory experience an unbounded leak by creating many caches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1092407150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1092465865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2698#issuecomment-1092465865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2698","id":1092465865,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5BHbTJ","user":{"login":"asereda-gs","id":25229979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI5OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25229979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs","html_url":"https://github.com/asereda-gs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-08T05:52:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T05:52:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The problem is that `ElasticsearchSchemaFactory` (or other `SchemaFactory` implementations for that matter) creates new resource but it doesn't know exactly when to close it, only application does.\r\n\r\nFreeing resources on `finalize()` or cache timeout looks more like a hack.\r\n\r\nI believe there should be an explicit `close()` call from library user for `ElasticsearchSchemaFactory` to free its resources. \r\n\r\nMaybe `Schema` or `SchemaFactory` should be implementing `AutoCloseable`.
