This interceptor would be invoked twice, one for origin request and another for fallback request.  The ServerWebExchange for these two aren't exactly the same one, but the former one is a delegate inside of the latter one, thus, they **share the same attributes.**  \r\n\r\nThe problem of the old code is that get the span from attributes within the execution of Mono would get span for latter request twice.   so just move this part of code out could solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThen there is a new question about the operation name. Because  _BEST_MATCHING_PATTERN_ATTRIBUTE_  is also in attributes,  leave the setOperationName in  Mono make both two spans use the fallback url as operationName. But move these codes out would change the recording result of requests with path parameters, from /annotation/{test} to /annotation/foo or /annotation/loo with the parameter shown, because the best matching pattern is calculated after mono are subscribed.  And that's what makes the plugin test fail before.\r\n\r\nI tried several ways on  adjusting the order of execution  to solve this,  but it seems imposibble to make the mono chain work like expected. So instead I check whether the best matching pattern really match the url.  This check code is how webflux generating the best match pattern, so should not lead to any problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/881861114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/881862001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7320#issuecomment-881862001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7320","id":881862001,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls840kCVx","user":{"login":"lujiajing1126","id":2568208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2568208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126","html_url":"https://github.com/lujiajing1126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-17T09:03:39Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T09:03:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think have a javadoc issue.

I am not saying there is no bug, as I didn't check all details. This is for namespace topic of agent side specific.\r\n\r\n@wu-sheng yeah, KafkaReporterPluginConfig#Plugin#Kafka#NAMESPACE does work at the agent side for the namespace. but when using namespace at the oap and agent side, oap will create four  topics except for \"meter\" topics.  whereas, when starting agent with the same namespace, agent will check the \"meter\" topic is or not existed.  That's to say, agent will check five kind of metric topics but oap only register and create four topics depending on the default config. So I suggest that we should give default \"true\" value to \"enableMeterSystem\" in application.yaml at oap side  in order to keep the logic consistency of creating and consuming topic at oap and agent side. I had already  tested it last Friday, it worked. All the three problem mentioned above have been fixed in my local repository.  I am making full test and submit a pull request once done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/881984084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/881984859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7316#issuecomment-881984859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7316","id":881984859,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls840kgVb","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-18T01:53:35Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T01:53:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It makes sense to activate in default or always.

You could do the same thing to extend the implementation, without changing the structure. \r\nAll existing modules with this structure means SkyWalking is going to provide multiple implementation, but we wouldn't.
