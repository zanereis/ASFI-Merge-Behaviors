Of course, that would involve lot of discussion and don't know what is the recommended forum to have that discussion (mailing list, jira or PR). \n\nHere is an example:\nComparing forward functions in scripts/staging/SystemML-NN/nn/layers/conv_builtin.dml and src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/api/dl/layer/ConvolutionLayer.java: Both have same expression for forward for convolution but differ in bias. \nCaffe generator will output:\n\n``` python\nones_2 = matrix(1.0, rows=1, cols=(P_2*Q_2));\nH_2 = H_2 + matrix(bias_2 %*% ones_2, rows=1, cols=(32*(P_2*Q_2)));\n```\n\nwhereas DML library will use:\n\n``` python\nfor (i in 1:P_2*Q_2-1)\n    bias = cbind(bias, b)  # creating shape (32, P_2*Q_2)\nH_2 = H_2 + matrix(bias, rows=1, cols=32*P_2*Q_2)\n```\n\nLinks:\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/160/files#diff-512c25ade02fd0dd41ee07a7b415f85bR70\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/158/files#diff-3fc6d70003f29a7bb91bac7dd043af30R113\n\nEither ways, I think we are heading in right direction wrt DML library and Caffe DML generator. I can imagine both serving the needs/painpoints of different types of end-users :) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/220104907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/220118623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/166#issuecomment-220118623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/166","id":220118623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDExODYyMw==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T18:35:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T18:35:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All tests passed [here](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/392/).\n\nLGTM.

The 'first-class' algorithms go in the primary scripts/algorithms directory. The 'second-class' scripts go in scripts/staging, which is excluded from all the artifacts (except in the src artifacts). By including scripts/algorithms/\\* and excluding scripts/staging/*, all first-class scripts are automatically included, and all second-class scripts are excluded. When an algorithm script has graduated, it is moved from scripts/staging/ to scripts/algorithms/ and will automatically be placed in each build artifact.

Awesome work - thanks @akunft @fschueler @FelixNeutatz @carabolic . Couple of comments:\n\n1) Setup: Even with HADOOP_HOME properly configured there were issues so I disabled the respective code in InfrastructureAnalyzer. This is something, we should probably do anyway. Thanks for pointing this out. Furthermore, I had to reconfigure akka.framesize to 512MB to make these scenarios work.\n\n2) Performance: My biggest concern right now is performance but I'm sure there are simple fixes to that or I simply misconfigured Flink. Let us have a look at the comparison to the MR and Spark backends, where I exclude the time for Spark context creation because Flink runs against an initialized cluster too:\n- MR: LinregDS: 147s (2 jobs); LinregCG w/ 6 iterations: 361s (8 jobs) w/ mmchain; 628s (14 jobs) w/o mmchain\n- Spark: LinregDS: 71s (3 jobs); LinregCG w/ 6 iterations: 41s (8 jobs) w/ mmchain; 48s (14 jobs) w/o mmchain\n- Flink: LinregDS: 212s (3 jobs); LinregCG w/ 6 iterations: 1,047s (14 jobs) w/o mmchain\n\n3) MMchain instruction: Maybe you could add the mmchain instruction for the special case of t(X)%_%(X%_%v) to allow a better understanding what is going on here. This would remove any potential performance influence of broadcasts as the intermediate vector of 80MB does not need to be collected and redistributed via broadcast and it also reduces the number of scans per iteration from 2 to 1. You already have the necessary function implemented. \n\n4) JDK7 Compatibility: It would be great to ensure backwards compatibility with JDK7, i.e., replace JDK8 methods with their JDK7 counterparts as we try to simultaneously support older deployments and dev environments.\n\n5) FlinkExecutionContext Execute: You already commented wrt a clean handling of this call to pending dataset operations. Couldn't we remove this and simply call execute on write instructions - all other jobs are triggered when the buffer pool collects matrices from producing operations.

@asurve - most of the following comments are due to the recent modifications of the frame integration:\n\n1) Input/output infos: Could we consistently use binaryblock throughout the compiler, tests, and runtime for both matrices and frames (e.g., remove from Connection, DAG, CacheableData, etc). We can map it to BinaryBlockFrame input/output formats whenever required during runtime.\n\n2) Checkpoint: Meanwhile we support spark checkpoints over frames too. Hence, there is no need to disable this rewrite for frames any longer.\n\n3) Frame object: Why is there a need to have 'num rows per block' in the frame object - we could simply use a global optimizer constant whenever needed because this does not describe the actual data.\n\n4) Frame block: Furthermore, why is there a need for leftindexing changes on frame block. The additional indexing operations for multiple output blocks are ok, but the rest should stay in tact, right? Also, please remove any reference to longwritable from frame block (to be replaced with long). Similarly, why do we need a merge over unaligned blocks - any operation that wants to merge blocks should align them first.\n\n5) Frame read/write rdds: Please stick to the current version of reading/writing frame rdds; I did on purpose not implement guarded collect as the memory check needs further investigation first.\n\n6) Execution context frame primitives: The method getFrameRDDHandleForVariable is redundant, given the existence of getRDDHandleForVariable. Also please reuse the existing toFrameBlock (note that there is no notion of bclen for frames).\n\n7) Generalization broadcast matrix object: Could we remove the new matrix broadcast object and frame broadcast object? The valid check should be possible in a generic manner too, right? Also, please double check if we could generalize the partitioned matrix and frame blocks.\n\n8) RDDAggregateUtils: Please revert the signature change of mergeByFrameKey and change the usage in RDDConverterUtils. If there is a key type mismatch, let's call LongWritableToLong before merge.\n\n9) Write meta data file: Please consolidate this new method with the existing metadata write (which is already used for frames too) to avoid code duplication.\n\n10) UtilFunctions: It would be good to move the compare functionality with tolerance out of util functions and into test utils to clearly separate between performance relevant code and tests. Of course, you could still reuse whenever existing functionality directly matches the needs of your tests.\n\n11) Code style: Please update the exception messages of refactored code (e.g., indexing instructions), delete commented code, remove TODOs for MR (as we did not even start this yet), merge multiple static initializers, and make static constants final. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/223489574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/223711991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/172#issuecomment-223711991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/172","id":223711991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzcxMTk5MQ==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T22:43:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T22:43:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.

We are working on a fix for the akka framesize. The problem here seems to be the collect(), which uses akka to retrieve the data. For large data, this should be done via the data transport instead.\n2. As we see it, the performance problems are due to 2 drawback of the current Flink version:\n\na) Flink currently broadcasts data by sending the data to each slot of the task managers separately instead of sharing it among the slots of a task manager. Therefore, the amount of data sent over the network is increased with increasing number of slots per task managers. This seems like a bug, and we hope to fix this relatively fast.\n\nb) As Flink does not support caching of data in the moment, we have to re-read from HDFS every time data sources are accessed.\n1. We will try this, as it would at least omit the problem stated in 2 a. Thank you for pointing that out.\n2. Good point, we fixed that.\n3. Yes, we think this is possible and implement that.\n\nWe try to solve the problems mentioned in 1 and 2, but especially 2b. will take some time and needs to be accepted by the Flink community. What do you think is the best way to go in the meanwhile with regards to the integration in SystemML?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/224002082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/224078909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/155#issuecomment-224078909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/155","id":224078909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDA3ODkwOQ==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-06T20:32:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-06T20:32:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @petro-rudenko  ... that's a good point.

I would just recommend a couple of cleanups: \n\n1) Rewrite: Could you please apply the rewrite only if the number of parents of (lambda*X) is 1 i.e., the sum is the only consumer? This would ensure it is always beneficial to apply the rewrite.\n\n2) Rewrite code style: First, please remove the unnecessary casts to BinaryOp for data type checks and input references. Second, could we rename the rewrite to 'pushdownSumBinaryMult' and position it after pushdownUnaryAggTransposeOperation to group these similar rewrites together?\n\n3) Test scripts: It would be good to change the testscripts to something like \"lambda=sum(X)\" to test the rewrite with variables not just literals; furthermore, this would also test an interesting case of common subexpression elimination after rewrites (i.e., sum(X) should be executed just once). In addition, the R script should get only 'expectedDir' as an argument, which would allow you to change the scripts from args[2] to args[1] too.\n\n4) Test scripts copyright: Currently, both R scripts are missing the ASF copyright header - please add this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/224133174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/224201477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/119#issuecomment-224201477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/119","id":224201477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDIwMTQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T07:26:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T07:26:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for sharing these thoughts - that sounds good to me. In general, I'd say that, even without caching, the Flink integration would still be a valuable (experimental) feature, because it enables the SystemML community to play around with it and explore advanced features like iteration constructs. So, if we manage to bring the performance to a level that is consistently better than the MR backend (because there is no reason why it should not), I'll endorse it. If later Flink also adds support for distributed caching, even better.\n\nRegarding the broadcast issue, I was actually thinking that the lookup map of matrix blocks might implicitly replicate blocks, if (and only if) broadcasts are internally shared in serialized form. In that case, we could have addressed it with a lazy broadcast partition read (as we do in the MR backend, because a single task seldom reads all broadcast blocks). However, if broadcast are indeed sent to each slot, it is probably a good idea to fix this for the general case.  \n\nSo let's have a look into the mmchain instruction and re-evaluate these scenarios once we have it. This should help us understand these characteristics in detail but it will also be useful in general because this operation is the core of major algorithms like LinregCG, GLM, Logreg, and HITS.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/224201477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/224517608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/174#issuecomment-224517608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/174","id":224517608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDUxNzYwOA==","user":{"login":"shirisht","id":13215072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE1MDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13215072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht","html_url":"https://github.com/shirisht","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shirisht/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T08:03:15Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T08:03:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Deron, that is a whooping 30% reduction in size. awesome!\nBtw, I am curious about the performance impact  -- especially, the code change in `DummyCodeAgent.java`?

@tgamal - this is a great feature as the addressed pattern is indeed very common. Couple of comments: \n\n1) Simplify sparsity estimate to min(sp1+sp2, 1)\n\n2) Please rename the rewrite to 'fuse binary operation chain'. Also use something like 'tmp' as the name for the new ternary operator, and add the linenumbers to the debug output.\n\n3) Fix the lop comments of matrix/scalar operands (exchange the position scalar and second matrix)\n\n4) Make the ValueFunctionWithConstant class member private\n\n5) Test: Rename the test to RewriteFuseBinaryOpChainTest, incl the used dml/R scripts. Further, please decomment the actual testcases, add this class to the testsuite org.apache.sysml.test.integration.functions.misc.ZPackageSuite, remove all sysout prints from the test class, and remove the class comment copied from a different test. \n\n6) Why did you have to change RewriteSimplifyRowColSumMVMultTest.java?\n\n7) Add the missing copyright in RewriteAxpy.R and
