have discussed with @csantanapr.\r\nActually there is limitation in #2810.\r\n\r\nWith that change, we can't setup multiple couchdb nodes on a single machine.\r\nThis limitation comes from erlang epmd port.\r\n\r\nIt is briefly explained here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/2810#issuecomment-343837080\r\n\r\nWhen couchdb form a cluster it counts on erlang epmd to find other nodes.\r\nAll nodes will try to find each other with same port(`4369`).\r\nSince it is not possible to differentiate this port for each nodes, we can't run multiple nodes on a single machine.\r\n\r\nOne idea is, make all nodes communicate with each other using container IP.\r\nIf they are on same machine, they will be in the same docker network and reachable to each other.\r\nBut I am not sure if it works, and it requires many dirty changes.\r\n\r\nSo @cbickel and I tried to take current approach.\r\n\r\n@csantanapr advised me to clearly write down current situation in README.\r\nMy bad, I should expect many people might be confused.\r\nI will work on

Since we are indeed community driven, all it would take would be a pull request for us to review and consider adding support for more runtime languages and have the community back it and affirm they would be willing to support it.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, we successfully added support for PHP (7.1) around August following this approach using the contributions of an individual developer and would welcome similar ones.  If you want to solicit interest from the community, it would be great to post to our Apache project \"dev\" list (dev@openwhisk.incubator.apache.org).\r\n\r\nHere is a link to tell you how to subscribe to the list: http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/contact\r\nIf you want to contribute, our Wiki has a few instructions on \"how to become a Contributor\" here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENWHISK/OpenWhisk+Project+Wiki\r\n\r\nand again, thanks for your interest.  Personally, I would love to see more supported language runtimes and loved my time using C# several years ago when doing Azure web service work!\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any help.

So I do not see how PureConfig would help us here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/348520327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/348522332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3017#issuecomment-348522332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3017","id":348522332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODUyMjMzMg==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-01T15:22:13Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T15:22:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"rebased to pick up single couchdb for travis","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/348522332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/348592345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2991#issuecomment-348592345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2991","id":348592345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODU5MjM0NQ==","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-01T19:30:22Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T19:30:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG2 2423 🔵 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/348592345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
