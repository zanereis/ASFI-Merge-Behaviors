Will come back to this after that.\r\n\r\nQuick feedback:\r\n  - I am still thinking that the random suffix breaks the original idea of the cached blobs.\r\n  - The blob manager counts references to files and does not delete them as long as someone has a reference. That prevents deletion if multiple parties work with the same jar.\r\n  - Properly handling rename and add reference in one lock, as well as de-reference and delete in the same lock should fix it, I think\r\n  - The blob manager needs to make sure it has an exclusive directory, so that no other process accesses the files. But I think that is the case already.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292045596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292053587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3676#issuecomment-292053587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3676","id":292053587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjA1MzU4Nw==","user":{"login":"shaoxuan-wang","id":9400874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDA4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9400874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang","html_url":"https://github.com/shaoxuan-wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shaoxuan-wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T02:43:36Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T02:43:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @fhueske, these changes look good to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292053587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292079828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3675#issuecomment-292079828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3675","id":292079828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjA3OTgyOA==","user":{"login":"haohui","id":1192828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTI4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1192828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui","html_url":"https://github.com/haohui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haohui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T06:20:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T06:20:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the PR!

My motivation is the following:\r\n- it can be expressed with `TUMBLE` (which is even more expressive)\r\n- We will add support for \"non-windowed\" aggregations (see PR #3646 by @shaoxuan-wang ) which can include the `GROUP BY FLOOR/CEIL` case. These aggregations will compute the same result but behave differently at runtime. Instead of collecting data and emitting a final result, they will be incrementally computed and send out more updates. I think the behavior of system is more predictable if we only translate Calcite's group window functions into DataStream group windows and all other grouped aggregates into non-windowed aggregates. We target the non-windowed aggregates for the next release.\r\n- It will make the translation easier. The pattern matching of `FLOOR/CEIL` seems a bit fragile to me. I like Calcite's group window functions more.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about this change and if you have concerns.\r\n\r\nBest, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292133543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292137414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3681#issuecomment-292137414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3681","id":292137414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjEzNzQxNA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T10:49:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T10:49:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the PR @sunjincheng121.\r\n+1 to merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292137414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292137939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3684#issuecomment-292137939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3684","id":292137939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjEzNzkzOQ==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T10:51:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T10:51:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292137939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/292139324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3680#issuecomment-292139324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3680","id":292139324,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjEzOTMyNA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T10:58:35Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T10:58:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol thanks for the review.

As per the discussion on the JIRA issue the intention is to merge in the master the support for sorting based on proctime and event time (potentially with additional fields) in append only mode. The other cases (having offset, fetch..) will be merged in the retraction branch. The backbone for the 2 is the same and this implementation contains it.\r\nPlease review it and let me know if you have particular comments mainly about the structure and the idea on how to approach it.\r\nAs reference the key point is to support this via aggregates. Therefor we have a sort aggregate where we accumulate rows which are internally sorted and maintained in a sorted list based on the order given by the keys. This requires to have a single extension for retrieving the results in the form of a getValues instead of getValue.\r\n\r\nA second remark is about the usage of processFunction (with the advantage that values are accumulated/sorted as they come) - which by default requires partition. However, if there is a prepartition of the stream beforehand this would reshufle all elements. If this case is possible i will drop the partitionBy before the function (i hope this does not break the usage of ValueState) - i will add a specific comment inline\r\n\r\nFor the tests - please ignore them as instead of integration tests i will use the harness

The PR is supposed to work on 1.3-SNAPSHOT, but it's not testable now due to some known bugs. \r\n\r\nBesides, i want to add support for asynchronous snapshots of timers in this pull request. Currently, the snapshots for timers are taken synchronously --- no stream record can be processed before the snapshots are taken. In our tests where there are millions of timers, it takes approximately several seconds to complete the snapshotting. The performance, hence, is significantly degraded when the checkpoint frequency is large.\r\n\r\nTo allow asynchronous snapshotting, we need some refactoring on how internal timer services are restored and snapshotted. Now `InternalTimerService` s, similar to keyed states, are stored in `KeyedStateBackend`. That way, we can benefit from the optimizations made on the snapshotting of keyed states, taking snapshots asynchronously (and incrementally in the near future).\r\n\r\nI am working on this work right now.  It's appreciated that you could help test the feature when it is done.

started looking into the issue a bit more. \r\nIt seems like it has to do with the new lambda generation in scala 2.12 and not with the asm library. \r\n\r\nFrom the scala 2.12-M3 release notes (https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.0-M3): \r\n\r\n> Java 8 style closure classes\r\n> \r\n> Scala 2.12 emits closures in the same style as Java 8.\r\n> \r\n> For each lambda the compiler generates a method containing the lambda body.\r\n> At runtime, this method is passed as an argument to the LambdaMetaFactory provided by the JDK, which creates a closure object.\r\n> \r\n> Compared to Scala 2.11, the new scheme has the advantage that the compiler does not generate an anonymous class for each lambda anymore.\r\n> This leads to significantly smaller JAR files.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ClosureCleaner uses the class name for instantiating the ClassReader, which is used later on. \r\n\r\nHowever, since scala2.12 doesn't generate anonymous classes, the file isn't found (null), therefore we get class not found exception, which make sense now. \r\n\r\nWe have to look into how to circumvent/implement this new generation of 'lambdas'. \r\n\r\nA small technical example, the testclass which throwed an exception `AcceptPFTestBase`. \r\n  And then the line containing: `protected val groupedTuples = tuples.groupBy(_._1)`\r\nSince tuples is a `Dataset` the function that we have to check is `_._1` (an anonymous function). \r\n\r\nwhen compiling/executing with scala 2.11 \r\nwe get `class org.apache.flink.api.scala.extensions.base.AcceptPFTestBase$$anonfun$1` as `cls` in the `ClosureCleaner.getClassReader` method. \r\nAnd this is indeed a file generated by the scala compiler and can be resolved by `ls.getResourceAsStream(className)`.\r\n\r\nHowever when using scala 2.12\r\nwe get `class org.apache.flink.api.scala.extensions.base.AcceptPFTestBase$$Lambda$11/1489743810` which is not an existing file, and cannot be resolved by `ls.getResourceAsStream(className)`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcluding, according to me, with the new scala 2.12 style with lambdas, the current closurecleaner doesn't suffice. \r\nThere is also a Spark issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14540) regarding closures in scala 2.12/java8. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts how to proceed?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/293704934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/293805598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3700#issuecomment-293805598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3700","id":293805598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzgwNTU5OA==","user":{"login":"rtudoran","id":16573790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTczNzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16573790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran","html_url":"https://github.com/rtudoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-13T06:49:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-13T06:49:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske
