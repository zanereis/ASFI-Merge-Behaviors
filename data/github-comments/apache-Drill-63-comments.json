\r\n\r\n> if you run the UI scenario from your earlier comment, you should see that the plugin is rejected if invalid and enabled. The config is stored, but not instantiated, if invalid and disabled.\r\n\r\nI like this behavior, +1 for this approach.\r\n\r\n> If a plugin ever fails, should it be disabled? How would this work for a temporary outage? The user would have to manually re-enable the plugin when it becomes valid again.\r\n\r\nI think in this case we should NOT disable the plugin. Once DB will be back online, assume we have rdbms plugin, user will be able to query using this plugin and no additional actions will be required. The problem in disabling is that only admin has permission to enable  / disable plugins, so on Production environments real users would first need to know when DB is back online and then ask admins to enable the plugin, which maybe not really convenient.\r\n\r\n> On a completely unrelated topic, there is code in the original version that forces all names of stored plugins to lower case (removing any mixed-case versions and replacing them), but no code enforces the lower-case rule in the in-memory cache. (I have tests that specifically test this case.) However, names are forced to lower case in storage. This seems more on the \"bug\" side of the ledger than the \"feature\" side. Should we allow mixed case everywhere or nowhere? Yet another thing to fix in the next PR.\r\n\r\nWe should enforce lower-case plugin names everywhere.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/597604478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/597676574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1962#issuecomment-597676574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1962","id":597676574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzY3NjU3NA==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T14:46:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T14:46:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cgivre / @paul-rogers also I suspect that after https://github.com/apache/drill/commit/88a84b9d088dad549e8489c487c55c9d7aecff9a was merged. this PR would require additional changes, for example, schema merge logic...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/597676574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/597710417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2010#issuecomment-597710417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2010","id":597710417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzcxMDQxNw==","user":{"login":"agozhiy","id":31588230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31588230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy","html_url":"https://github.com/agozhiy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T15:46:47Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T15:46:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, the problem is: if a plugin is invalid and **disabled**, it is not being rejected.

like a very cool feature. I've not been following the metadata implementation closely. Can you help get me up to speed by providing a bit more background information? What is the goal of this PR? Does it enable the format plugins to gather metadata if they choose, or does this PR actually add the metadata gathering itself?\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, one of the things that the metadata framework does is to infer schema. Whether inferring schema for metadata, or inferring schema for a scan, we hit the same ambiguities. How does this code handle a schema conflict? Or, do we just assume the schema is whatever we get in the sample?\r\n\r\nHow do we gather stats? Do we have the reader read all the data and have a downstream operator make sense of the data?\r\n\r\nFor files that need a provided schema (CSV, say), do we apply stats to the columns after type conversion, or are stats gathered on the raw text values? That is, does this work use the provided schema if available? How does the provided schema relate to the metadata schema?\r\n\r\nWhat stats will we gather for non-Parquet files? How will we use them? Looks like there is code for partitions (have not looked in depth, so I may be wrong). Are we using stats for partition pruning? If so, how does that differ from the existing practice of just walking the directory tree?\r\n\r\nI think that if I understand some of this background I'll be able to do a more complete review. Thanks!\r\n\r\nJust so we're on the same page, I'm working on a revision to how we handle schema. Basically, the EVF-based operators will fully integrate the provided schema, and will be ready for a \"defined\" schema created by the planner (as in a classic query engine where the planner does all the schema calculations.) The idea is to use dynamic schema (what Drill has always done) when sampling the first row tells us all we need to know (as in Parquet), but to encourage a provided schema when sampling is not reliable (as in JSON.)\r\n\r\nThis means that we have a flow something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUser --> Provided Schema --> Scan <-- Reader <-- Input Source Schema\r\n                               |\r\n                               v\r\n                     Scan output schema\r\n```\r\nThe scan output schema describes the data a scan will deliver. Hopefully, this is also the schema used by stats gathering.\r\n\r\nDo you see any potential conflicts between your metadata model and the above provided schema model?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/599018591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/599032547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2026#issuecomment-599032547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2026","id":599032547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTAzMjU0Nw==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-14T09:26:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T09:26:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, this pull request enables the format plugin to gather metadata. Metadata gathering logic was added in DRILL-7273.\r\n\r\nRegarding the schema, when metadata is collecting, rules are the same as for regular select queries - Drill tries to infer the table schema or uses user-provided schema.\r\n\r\nCollecting metadata logic may become clearer after reading this section of docs: https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/docs/dev/MetastoreAnalyze.md#analyze-operators-description or this design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pSIzKqDltjLEEpEebwmKnsDPxyS_6jGrPOjXu6M_NM/edit?usp=sharing\r\nIn short, yes, we use a reader that reads all the data and downstream operators for transforming and storing its statistics.\r\n\r\n> For files that need a provided schema (CSV, say), do we apply stats to the columns after type conversion, or are stats gathered on the raw text values? That is, does this work use the provided schema if available?\r\n\r\nYes, we apply stats to the columns after schema conversion, so such stats as min/max would have correct values in the scope of natural ordering.\r\n\r\n> How does the provided schema relate to the metadata schema?\r\n\r\nAfter the provided schema is used in the scan, Drill will use the resolved schema for columns and store it to the metastore.\r\n\r\n> What stats will we gather for non-Parquet files? How will we use them? Looks like there is code for partitions (have not looked in depth, so I may be wrong). Are we using stats for partition pruning? If so, how does that differ from the existing practice of just walking the directory tree?\r\n\r\nWe collect exactly the same stats for non-parquet files. We may use them in the same way as it is used in parquet - prune files when filter for specific columns is specified, prune unneeded files for limit queries. Dirs pruning would still work in the same way as it worked before changes (it also works for parquet).\r\nI think some tests in `TestMetastoreWithEasyFormatPlugin` will help to understand which optimizations are added.\r\n\r\n> Do you see any potential conflicts between your metadata model and the above provided schema model?\r\n\r\nLooks like there shouldn't be any conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/599032547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/599107346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2025#issuecomment-599107346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2025","id":599107346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTEwNzM0Ng==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-14T17:41:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T17:41:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Very cool feature, thanks!\r\n\r\nI wonder, is it possible to add a unit test for this?

additional question that came up in the context of reviewing another PR: we now have three ways to specify a schema: 1) table functions, 2) a provided schema file, and 3) metastore. Would be great if the docs can discuss how these are related.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose I have a provided schema and run `ANALYZE TABLE`. Does Drill uses my provided schema instead of trying to infer the schema? If so, this is a good way for users to resolve issues that might crop up for JSON or other formats where the metadata schema inference fails.\r\n\r\nIf I have both a schema file, and the metastore, which schema is used to plan the query? Which is passed as the `schema` attribute to the `SubScan`?

Info about building Drill for different Hive versions is a workaround, we shouldn't recommend doing it for users if other alternatives available, so I don't think that we should document it. Also, when all supported profiles are moved to this version of Hive, code will be cleaned up to remove hacks which allowed using older versions.\r\n2. I don't see a way to achieve this. The issue here is in the interaction between Hive Jars with different versions. I assume besides API changes, also thrift format updates.\r\n3. I don't think so. For updating versions to 2.3.2, code was changed, so I think it still incompatible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/603237847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/603251228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2038#issuecomment-603251228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2038","id":603251228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzI1MTIyOA==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-24T13:52:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T13:52:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvysotskyi \r\nThanks for the response. The reason I ask is that for many enterprises, they are at the mercy of IT teams and in many cases they are forced to use older versions of tools like Hive.  Often, the upgrade schedules are years behind the most current version.  (I'm speaking from experience here..;-))\r\n\r\nObviously we should do our best to support the most current version of common platforms like Hive, however, I think you would be surprised at how many large enterprises still use very old versions of these tools.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/603251228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/603434987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2018#issuecomment-603434987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2018","id":603434987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzQzNDk4Nw==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-24T18:36:24Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T18:36:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, thanks for the suggestions, they solved the problem.

An issue is the HDFS dependency on the OkHttp 2.x series while the HTTP plugin depends on the newer \"okhtt3\" version. Fortunately, the package names are different, but we still have to load both into memory.\r\n\r\nIn general, each plugin depends on far too much stuff: we probably should not expose the Hadoop and HDFS classes to format plugins.

thanks for the review. How do you recommend we modify the documentation?\r\n\r\nMy thought was this: I put a one-line summary in the option description. Details on how the option works are in the file where the option is used. My thought was that the detailed user description should go into the docs somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe should decide how we want to handle option documentation. Most require more background explanation than fits in a simple doc string. (For this one, we have to explain how the partition sender works in order to know why you even need the option.) To me, the docs seem the place for these explanations. This leaves the doc string as a reminder and summary.\r\n\r\nAn improvement might be:\r\n\r\n1. Put the doc strings in a resource file. \r\n2.

Now it's up to the Drill contributor to ensure if his work is documented or not. `OptionDescription` information is used on Drill Web UI to describe options, so of course it is pretty useful if would have nice description. You can also add your description to the Drill site (create the PR, got it reviewed and then regenerate the site, there is an instruction how it should be done - https://github.com/apache/drill/tree/gh-pages-master/).\r\n\r\nWhy I have asked you to add java doc? I don't know how and when you are going to document new option. But you wrote really nice description and I did not want it to be lost, having it at least in java doc would help people in future who might be reverse-engineering this code or even users who would need to understand how this option works.\r\n\r\nFrankly saying, having this documentation section in PR template, does not make any difference since who do we expect to transfer documentation to the Drill web site? Developer who created the PR? I did not see much documentation PRs expect of @vvysotskyi who added info about Drill Metastore. cc @cgivre ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/609650653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/610011770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2040#issuecomment-610011770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2040","id":610011770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDAxMTc3MA==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T20:12:14Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T20:12:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @vvysotskyi for the review.\r\nCommits squashed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/610011770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/610200359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2047#issuecomment-610200359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2047","id":610200359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDIwMDM1OQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-07T06:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T06:26:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva you made good points.
