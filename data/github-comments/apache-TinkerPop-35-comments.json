found some time. Wew.\r\n\r\nWell, this PR is very well crafted - well done! My comments are only minor:\r\n* About `utils.toPromise` - if I understand you well, you want a dual callback/promise API for most async functions?\r\n* In `graph-traversal.js`, most methods of `GraphTraversalSource` and `GraphTraversal` and function attached to `statics` could maybe be dynamically created from an array of method names and dynamically added to these classes/object. I don’t know what would be the performance implication of this, but I don’t think there should be any unless V8 really can’t figure out what’s going on when parsing that file. Hopefully it's smart and figures out that the class is not changing. That’d lower the file size and help maintainability a lot.\r\n* ES6, most likely friendlier for more recent versions of V8 and supported by Node.js v4+ (see [Node green](http://node.green)):\r\n    * `arguments` is deprecated and is replaced by `...args` for variadic functions\r\n    * most `function` keywords could be replaced by arrow functions (lexical scoping and/or concise syntax). I tend to keep `function` for top-level functions, and use fat arrows everywhere even when `this` binding isn't needed (ie. callback w/o `this`)\r\n    * `array.splice(0)` could be replaced by `const copy = [...original]`\r\n    * `func.apply(null, arguments)` could be replaced by `func(...args)` when first argument `this` value is indeed meant to be `null`\r\n* `package.json`: `./node_modules/.bin` is added to the `$PATH` by `npm` or `yarn`, so we could just use `\"test\": \"mocha test/unit test/integration -t 5000\"`. Yay npm!\r\n\r\nI can fork and push 4 distinct commits for this if you want, so this can be cherry-picked.\r\n\r\nA more major update would be to author in ES6/7/8 and add a transpilation step, so all runtime could use code that they can optimize best. Using babel with [babel-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-env) combined with [postinstall-build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postinstall-build) is an option. This will ensure that latest versions of Node.js use mostly non-transpiled code, while older versions automatically transpile what is strictly needed. That would make things more performant for latest versions of Node.js, since V8 optimizes a lot for new syntax, while still making the GLV compatible for older versions of Node.js. The nice thing is that the build step is automatically handled at install time by npm, so no extra maven coding should be required. I think such approach could be added in future releases and is out of scope today.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm ok to transfer/donate the \"gremlin\" package name to Apache TinkerPop so this can be published under this name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358482362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358613893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/695#issuecomment-358613893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/695","id":358613893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODYxMzg5Mw==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T11:05:00Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T11:05:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> About `utils.toPromise` - if I understand you well, you want a dual callback/promise API for most async functions?\r\n\r\nJust promise-based API, no callback-based API. `utils.toPromise()` its a way to support different \"promise factories\", the way promises are created in the driver.

to https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues/1026, users should be able to just patch the global `Promise` object in their application with:\r\n```javascript\r\nglobal.Promise = require(\"bluebird\");\r\n```\r\nI am unsure about other Promise libraries but I believe this approach should work as long as they're Promise/A+ standard compliant. Maybe we could also give it more thoughts and see for other ways to handle this in a future release, but I think it's worth making the code simpler at this point. I also feel it can/should be done at the application level.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Traversal methods, I didn't think about IDEs and you're absolutely right about code completion. I think your proposed approach with `callOnEmptyTraversal` works best. This makes me think that I'm pretty sure people will want typed traversals with TypeScript or FlowType soon (thinking about https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped here for example).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358975657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/359006413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/778#issuecomment-359006413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/778","id":359006413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTAwNjQxMw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T15:55:34Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T15:55:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All

The problem is that if when we look at the diff to review, it contains changes that don't pertain to your work, which makes the changes impossible to evaluate by themselves. I imagine you must have merged tp32 into the branch in your fork or something.  You should have instead rebased your local changes onto our tp32 which would have re-wrote all of your commits on top of ours so that the git history made it look like you had all your changes on the head of tp32.

I don't know the full state of your fork, so it's hard to give advice, but perhaps you need to:\r\n\r\n1. update your fork's tp32 branch with the latest from tinkerpop\r\n2. `git checkout tp32`\r\n3. `git checkout -b TINKERPOP-1862-revised`\r\n4. cherry pick just your commits from TINKERPOP-1862 over to TINKERPOP-1862-revised\r\n5. kill the old TINKERPOP-1862 (local and remote) and rename it TINKERPOP-1862-revised appropriately by dropping the \"-revised\" then push that\r\n\r\nThen going forward all you should have to do is keep your fork's tp32 branch updated and periodically: `git rebase origin/tp32` on the TINKERPOP-1862 branch which will continually take all your changes and replay them on the head of your fork's tp32.\r\n\r\nIf you have some other more elegant git solution, that's cool too....just providing the hammer solution to the problem in case you can't figure out anything better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/362062463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/362236533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/790#issuecomment-362236533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/790","id":362236533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjIzNjUzMw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-01T11:20:11Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T11:20:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All
