But now we don't have any available `RowData` readers and writers,  so we could only write unit test based on `TaskWriter<Row>`.   In future,  Once the `RowData` parquet/avro/orc reader/writers are available, I will change the `RowTaskWriterFactory` to `RowDataTaskWriterFactory` , also the unit test (that's should be easy to do).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/668012934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/668018068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1286#issuecomment-668018068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1286","id":668018068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODAxODA2OA==","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-03T13:18:49Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T13:18:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> continuously appends the table with trigger period 10s.\r\n\r\nYou mean the spark streaming job will commit to iceberg table for every 10 seconds ?

I've posted that [union prototype](https://gist.github.com/rdblue/1d39763be41b59b8637d50162f7fe2ea) as a gist.\r\n\r\nThe gist includes a `SchemaWithPartnerVisitor` pattern that is like the `SchemaWithTypeVisitor`. It handles the logic of traversing two schemas at the same time and passing \"partner\" objects along with the schema that is being traversed. The partner objects are accessed using a small set of methods, like `fieldPartner` to access a field's partner from a struct's partner.\r\n\r\nThe gist also includes an implementation, `UnionByNameVisitor`. That visitor extends `SchemaWithPartnerVisitor`, where the partner is the equivalent field ID in the \"existing\" schema. By passing the existing schema's IDs, we can avoid keeping track of the ancestor names in the visitor. Instead, the prototype looks up the name in the existing schema from the ID when it needs to call `addColumn` with a parent name. That avoids all of the string logic and the need for `beforeField` callbacks. It also implements my suggestion to return a boolean to indicate whether a type is missing.\r\n\r\nSee what you think about that prototype. I think it's good to have better separation between the traversal logic and the union logic, it is nice to not need to maintain the ancestor list, and it is a bit cleaner when detecting what changes need to be applied.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/668126179/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/668138126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1208#issuecomment-668138126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1208","id":668138126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODEzODEyNg==","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-03T17:11:59Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T17:11:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue @rdsr Let me know if there's any comment.

I have Spark Structured Streaming job which writes daily partitioned table and produce files of different size, primarily small ones. I ran `RewriteDataFilesAction` a few times on a single partition.\r\nFirst run produced 86 files with size up to 128Mb as I configured. Second run took all these files and compacted them again merging them with very small files. Third run again took all files produced by previous job and compacted them again.\r\n\r\nI understand that eventually compacted files will become so close to `targetSize` that they will be ignored, but until this happened we need to rewrite gigabytes of data again and again. Also it doesn't work for me because compaction process is relevant only for current day. At the beginning of new day we run major compaction with deduplication, sorting etc. and like \"close\" partition for previous day, it will not be modified anymore. Intermediate minor compaction is necessary only to prevent clients from reading thousands of small files.\r\n\r\nApplying filter by row timestamp can improve the situation, but as we have many tables with completely different size we need to choose right compaction period for each table to have output files with reasonable size. It's really difficult to manage because their size can vary, new table can be added, etc. Also we have late records which could not be considered for compaction if there is no fresh records in the file.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice to have separate configuration to limit file size or the predicate like @JingsongLi suggested. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/668660110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/668663342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1245#issuecomment-668663342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1245","id":668663342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODY2MzM0Mg==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-04T15:25:59Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T15:25:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Brief Discussion with @rdblue + @aokolnychyi lead to another approach we are going to try out for finding expired files.

We manually went through and deleted the tables in the databases (I think there was some issue previously which should be fixed now). The only other difference is that we clean up the files as well which is needed for EXTERNAL tables.
