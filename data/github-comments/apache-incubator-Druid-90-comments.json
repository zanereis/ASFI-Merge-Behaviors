 (please hold off on merging a bit) I'd like to see more information on the intended use case.\n\nHere are the things I'm seeing as a result of this PR:\n- There is both serviceName and NodeTypeConfig. the NodeTypeConfig is currently only used in `StorageNodeModule` for reporting server metadata. You are expanding its capacity here and I'm not sure that is the best way to do things\n- It is entirely possible for an extension to inject a string value from a property. If this is for reporting purposes AND `serviceName` is insufficient, can you explain why having a customizable property string is also insufficient?\n\nAnd as mentioned earlier, there hasn't been a good delineation of services vs capacities/modules. Different CLIs have a collection of capacities which are grouped together into the service. CLIs are extensible and custom extensions can have various implementations, and even different combinations of properties greatly change the behavior of the service (we have both fast and slow brokers for example, that behave very differently even though they are both CliBroker).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/223096566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/223100762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3048#issuecomment-223100762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3048","id":223100762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzEwMDc2Mg==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T19:35:06Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T19:35:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen

thanks - the last lines of the log seems to indicate that there are 4 \"active\" tasks which matches your spec (2 taskCount \\* 2 replicas) so the supervisor's done its job there; active here means that they are either pending start or are running on a worker, but the startTime being unavailable probably means that they are sitting in pending state and haven't been picked up by a middle manager (probably because your middle manager crashed). Does that seem to match what's happening, i.e. if you check your overlord console do you see 4 tasks sitting around waiting to start? If so, do you have worker capacity available (under the Remote Workers section of the console)?\n\nAlso is the MM exception happening fairly consistently or was it a one-off

for the feedback, to elaborate on the use case, the nodeType would be used to provide necessary context for events in a metrics collection/analysis UI (since the meaning of a metric event depends on the type of node it came from).\n\nserviceName can be overridden by users with their own naming conventions, so it's not suitable for this purpose.\n\nA customizable property string would work but would require the user to manage type configuration for all their nodes, which I feel is more error-prone than a fixed property.\n\nI'll close this PR, since the default serviceName is accessible to

I tried to reproduce it by forcing an exception at that point in the code but the MM and overlord were able to recover so I'm not exactly sure what sequence of events happened to get your overlord into that state. If you happen to see it again and can write up a fairly reliable repro for it, that would be super helpful. \n\nIn the meantime, I noticed that in your spec you had specified a replication factor of 2 but were only running one middle manager. Just wanted to make sure it was clear that replication works by enforcing that replica tasks run on separate middle managers so that ingestion won't be interrupted by the failure of an MM; hence for 2 replicas, you'll want to run at least 2 MMs (otherwise they'll just sit in pending and be killed when the running one succeeds without doing any work).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/223619958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
