Let's provide more original background for this [validation](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/e20088449daec9ed431754044b520b3ac5fa3eaa/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/flink/sink/IcebergFilesCommitter.java#L286):  it was added for validating the existence of data files that were referenced from the pos-delete files introduced in the current TXN which is planning to commit but have not committed yet.\r\n\r\nAfter I read the implementation of the `validateDataFilesExist` method,  I think I misunderstood the meaning of it before, because I thought it could validate the existence of data files that was planing to commit in the current TXN. While the real meaning is:  validate the existence of the data files after going through the history committed txn and ensuring that NO other OVERWRITE/REPLACE TXN has deleted the required data files. \r\n\r\nAbout the broken unit test [testValidateDataFileExist](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/8104769f81ba79338fd3c94d5bd9267f22d31ed7/flink/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/flink/sink/TestIcebergFilesCommitter.java#L720) by this PR,  I think it is addressing the case that will never happen in the real CDC user case, because its steps are following: \r\n\r\n* Step.1 :  Start a txn.1 to insert a row `<1, 'aaa'>`, which produces a `data-file1`; \r\n* Step.2 : Start a txn.2 to replace the whole iceberg table with a newly produced row `<2, 'bbb'>`,  it will remove the old data file `data-file-1` and add a new data file `data-file2`;\r\n* Step.3 :  Start a txn.3 to commit a row delta txn , which includes a pos-delete to delete the old row `<1, 'aaa'>`.\r\n\r\nThe key point is:  in the real flink CDC user case,  we won't produce any pos-deletes in a new txn to delete a row coming from an older txn, we just produce pos-deletes to delete a row that comes from the same txn as the pos-delete ( as @rdblue said, `Because position deletes will only reference data files being added to the table, there is no possibility that those files are concurrently deleted` ).  In summary,  the unit test is trying to address a case that will never happen in the real user case,  so I would like to remove this unit test in this PR. \r\n\r\nThanks all for the patient work

My original thought in #3237 was that we can define the rule that the shared code can continue to live, and any code that cannot build againt all versions should then be refactored to different version modules.\r\n\r\nI think that compiling against different versions of Spark is beginning to be a significant risk due to changes across versions. That's only going to get worse when we start adding flags for Scala version as well and continue to add more extensions that touch Spark internals. I don't think it's a good idea to try to refactor common classes out unless they don't have a compile dependency on Spark. And in that case, we can more them to core like the `Writer` classes.\r\n\r\n> . . . The intention is again to minimize duplicated code by minimizing the number of version folders.\r\n\r\nI think we're actually better off the other way. What we have now does some pretty crazy things to deal with multiple Spark versions and I think we'll end up with cleaner code if we just duplicate it. This is one of the reasons why I think we want these build changes.\r\n\r\n> In #3237 I had another scalaVersion system property to allow setting a flexible Scala version. Do you think that is something worth adding?\r\n\r\nYes, but as a follow-up. This is just a PR to put a basic structure in place and we will continue to improve it in future commits.\r\n\r\n> What would be the naming scheme for modules after v3.0?\r\n\r\nWe don't need to decide this now, since this doesn't introduce new modules yet. I'd like to focus on getting this in with minimal changes since it's already so

agree with @pvary that it would be better if Spark supported the same SQL syntax for time travel queries as Hive and Impala, especially if the syntax in question is the SQL standard.

Is it not possible to implement the support using SQL extensions in Iceberg?\r\n\r\nOrthogonal to that, I think that metadata tables are conceptually different from snapshots, so while I think something like `<catalog>.<database>.<table>.history` or `<catalog>.<database>.<table>.snapshots` have a certain naturalness, `<catalog>.<database>.<table>.snapshot_id_<id>` is a different kind of beast than the metadata tables, and using the same syntax for the snapshots is lumping two different kinds of things into the same category. Pardon my ignorance, but does the code for table identifiers limit us to using `.` for delimiting the name? Is it possible to use `@` for time travel, as @pvary suggests?

Yes, this one changes the relationship between Nessie and Iceberg metadata.\r\n\r\nTL;DR the changes shall ensure that changes against the same table on different branches can later be merged together without having duplicate column-IDs or partition-IDs or the like.\r\n\r\nYou're right, initially (in the \"early Nessie days\"), every Nessie commit held a pointer to the table-metadata. This works fine until you reference the same table on different branches and perform e.g. schema changes (think: ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN) on both branches, which leads to duplicate column-ids (in other words: same column id used for different columns), which then can lead to data corruption when branches get merged.\r\n\r\nSo the initial approach in this PR was to maintain table-metadata across all branches and \"just\" reference the snapshot-ID from in Nessie commits, which led to other issues (not explaining it here further, but schema changes became an issue again).\r\n\r\nThe current approach is more like the initial approach: have the pointer to table-metadata in Nessie commits but track state that's important across all Nessie branches (e.g. last-column-ID) globally. It's currently implemented via additional functionality in TableMetadata to retrieve the \"global state\" (last-column-ID, last-used-partition-ID, last-assigned-sequence-ID) as an object that's opaque to Nessie plus functionality to update a TableMetadata using that \"global state\".\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/943176314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/943268321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3115#issuecomment-943268321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3115","id":943268321,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX844OSHh","user":{"login":"henry-on-the-internet","id":73651440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjUxNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73651440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet","html_url":"https://github.com/henry-on-the-internet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henry-on-the-internet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T11:28:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T11:28:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is it assigned?\r\nIf not, may I try this one?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/943268321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/943344282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3250#issuecomment-943344282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3250","id":943344282,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX844Okqa","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-14T13:14:08Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T13:14:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx: Rebased, and rerun the flaky test (TestFlinkTableSink#testReplacePartitions).
