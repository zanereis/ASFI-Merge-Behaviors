@ijuma @junrao \r\n\r\nA couple initial points of discussion:\r\n\r\n1. Message class hierarchy. The `LogEntry` interface now represents the record set and `LogRecord` represents the record. I have left `Records` with its current name which is a bit weird when you need to write things like `records.entries.records`. I have also been thinking of changing `LogEntry` to `LogRecordSet`, which would make the `Records` name a bit more intuitive. Previously I considered changing `Records` to simply `Log`, though that's a little annoying because of the server class with the same name.\r\n2. The new magic version is implemented in `EosLogEntry` and `EosLogRecord`. This name should be changed of course. Any suggestions? The old magic version is implemented in `OldLogEntry`, so we could call it `NewLogEntry`?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283204521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283205407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2605#issuecomment-283205407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2605","id":283205407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzIwNTQwNw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T00:26:51Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T00:26:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sharad-develop Can you please fix the rebasing issue?

`ConsumerNetworkClient.send()` needs to acquire global lock of `ConumserNetworkClient` in order to enqueue requests. If another thread has called `ConsumerNetworkClient.poll(..)`, that thread may be holding the lock while blocked on `nioSelector.select(ms)`. This causes problem because the user thread which calls `ConsumerNetworkClient.send()` will also block waiting for that `nioSelector.select(ms)` to finish.\r\n\r\nOne way to address this problem is to use `synchronized (unsent)` to protect access to `ConsumeNetworkClient.unsent` instead of protecting it using a global lock. So that user thread should be able to enqueue requests immediately while another thread is blocked on `nioSelector.select(ms)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283240383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283241530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2619#issuecomment-283241530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2619","id":283241530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzI0MTUzMA==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T04:26:26Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T04:26:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hachikuji @becketqin Would you have time to review this patch?

Thanks for the patch. The need for a second lock is a bit unfortunate. I'm wondering if you've considered other options? It seems `send` just needs to be able to enqueue the request safely while another thread is in poll() for this to work. One thought is to replace the map we use for unsent requests with a concurrent collection (e.g. `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`). Looking over the code, some parts might be a little more complex, others less if we did so. But maybe it's a reasonable tradeoff to try and keep the locking simple?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283248936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283252827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2619#issuecomment-283252827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2619","id":283252827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzI1MjgyNw==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T06:01:26Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T06:02:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hachikuji Thanks for reviewing the patch. Yes I have considered the idea of replacing `unsent` with some concurrent collection as you mentioned. But code using `synchronized(unsent)` seems simpler than that approach. For example, we need to have a lock while iterating over `unsent` (e.g. `pendingRequestCount()`, `checkDisconnects()`) and `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` does not provide an easy way to do that. Maybe it is possible to argue that these methods can still return acceptable results even if the items in the unsent can be changed while we iterate over it, but we would have to go through all the scenarios to prove it and the solution will be error prone.\r\n\r\nDo  you think there is clear performance advantage of using concurrent collection instead of using `synchronized(unsent)`. If not, maybe we can choose the solution that is simpler and less error prone?\r\n\r\nAlso, note that the performance of having this extra synchronzie(unset) will not be worse than current implementation of using a global lock everywhere.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283252827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
