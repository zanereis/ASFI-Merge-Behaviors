It would be correct-er to either depend directly on it, or not use it. To me it seems better to inline what amounts to one-liner access of a standard system property. \n\nI think it's also true that Guava is the go-to utility package and would be better to use Guava where possible rather than encourage use of lang too.\n\nThe use of lang3 in ReplSuite should also either be 'inlined', or else supplemented with a direct test-scope dependency. It's just a test, so not as big of an issue. I think the one use can even be replaced with a simple escape, which I presume is there to handle backslash on Windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42126473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42126543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/589#issuecomment-42126543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/589","id":42126543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI2NTQz","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-04T07:29:42Z","updated_at":"2014-05-04T07:29:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds good @pwendell , thanks for merging with the comma fix.\n\nShould I open a separate issue for the `JFunction2` question?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42126543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42126573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/628#issuecomment-42126573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/628","id":42126573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTI2NTcz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-04T07:31:48Z","updated_at":"2014-05-04T07:31:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

Even in YARN mode, AFAIK the executor number is just a request to the RM and not a guarentee.\n\nI'm still not 100% sure why this needs to exist. @mridulm  is the main concern here just launching non-local tasks? If so, why not just set `spark.locality.wait` threshold (that's the whole reason it exists).\n\nIn standalone mode this may not really be necessary because the executors typically launch in under 3 seconds which is the default locality wait.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42149808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42149840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/634#issuecomment-42149840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/634","id":42149840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTQ5ODQw","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-04T22:58:47Z","updated_at":"2014-05-04T22:58:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sryza @mridulm if we do decide we want to have a new type of waiting here, maybe we could add `spark.scheduler.initialWait` or something to give time to allow executors to show up before we try to schedule.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42149840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42150290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/569#issuecomment-42150290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/569","id":42150290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTUwMjkw","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-04T23:12:27Z","updated_at":"2014-05-04T23:12:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm ambivalent between inlining this and fixing up the dependency.
