you very much for your reply! Actually I ran im2rec with resize=227 and I tried serveral ways but all failed:\r\n\r\n1.data.set_data_aug_level(parser, 0) instead of level 3\r\n\r\n2.set image_shape to  very small value like '3,100,100' still failed but '3,1,1' succeed.\r\n\r\nI am really confused about that. The image_shape param is set to be smaller than the input shape of 227 but problem still occurred.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267814705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267818491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4272#issuecomment-267818491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4272","id":267818491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzgxODQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"lincolneejdk","id":10933897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTMzODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10933897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk","html_url":"https://github.com/lincolneejdk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincolneejdk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-18T12:27:56Z","updated_at":"2016-12-18T12:27:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Update：When set imageshape size to 50, we got:  It seems that the data augmentation is default, how to forbid that or is there any better solutions？\r\n \r\nINFO:root:Start training with [gpu(0)]\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch [20]   Speed: 809.11 samples/sec       Train-accuracy=0.001172\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch [40]   Speed: 707.19 samples/sec       Train-accuracy=0.001563\r\nmxnet/dmlc-core/include/dmlc/logging.h:235: [12:24:08] src/io/image_aug_default.cc:254: Check failed: static_cast<index_t>(res.rows) >= param_.data_shape[1] && static_cast<index_t>(res.cols) >= param_.data_shape[2] input image size smaller than input shape\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'dmlc::Error'\r\n  what():  [12:24:08] src/io/image_aug_default.cc:254: Check failed: static_cast<index_t>(res.rows) >= param_.data_shape[1] && static_cast<index_t>(res.cols) >= param_.data_shape[2] input image size smaller than input shape\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267818491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267819603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3930#issuecomment-267819603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3930","id":267819603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzgxOTYwMw==","user":{"login":"magic282","id":2285145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODUxNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2285145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282","html_url":"https://github.com/magic282","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-18T12:54:09Z","updated_at":"2016-12-18T12:54:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@sxjscience Sorry for late reply.

Compatibility of network graph generation API(without requirement of gradient, and scan)\r\n    - The model fitting logic swapped by module API in mxnet, with API compatibility\r\n- 2. Compatibility of the underlying execution code, gradient generation and optimization\r\n     - I feel this part could be more framework dependent, especially when it comes to multiGPU and multi machine\r\n\r\nI am all for both directions, but break it into two part will make the milestone easier, I am in favor of quickly achieving 1, so everything is functioning, and possibly stabbing 2 later.

I see the problem here. I could fix this example but it is hard to apply it to minpy, because not all the operators support `out` argument. It is not good to enforce such order in scheduling since sometimes we want to explore such parallelism. This looks like an inevitable problem of imperative programming?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/268124072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/268124209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4294#issuecomment-268124209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4294","id":268124209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODEyNDIwOQ==","user":{"login":"jermainewang","id":4057701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4057701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jermainewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T01:04:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T01:04:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like a trade-off between parallelism-first scheduling or memory-first scheduling.

have an idea to solve this problem in the scheduling part. Suppose we have dependency like:\r\n```\r\nfunc1() -> func2() -> func3()\r\n```\r\nAnd we know that the result of `func1()` will only be used by `func2()`. Suppose `func1()` is dispatched to thread_1. We then just directly execute `func2()` on thread_1 without dispatch `func2()` back to thread pool. This may solve the above problem because the result of the dot product is only used by += operation. Also, this could save some context switch overhead since fewer tasks will be pushed into thread pool.
