if you see the thread on my PR #3786, you'll see @mistercrunch wants the fix going into `superset.db_engine_spec`\r\n\r\nI looked at it the other day and didn't see an obvious way to apply our fix. \r\n\r\nI am curious about it and might try and dig further later this week or next.

tried to use `brotli` but couldn't get it to work, the npm package seemed to be out of date and broken (can't remember which one that was).  I ended up using `lz-string` as you suggested. \r\n\r\nThis is what I did in the swivel `index.jsx`, which keeps everything backwards compatible:\r\n```\r\nimport { decompressFromBase64 } from 'lz-string';\r\n\r\nlet formData;\r\nif (bootstrapData.lz_form_data) {\r\n  formData = JSON.parse(decompressFromBase64(bootstrapData.lz_form_data));\r\n} else if (bootstrapData.form_data) {\r\n  formData = JSON.parse(bootstrapData.form_data);\r\n} else {\r\n  formData = {};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the in the url generation in `exploreUtils.js` I added something like this:\r\n```\r\nimport { compressToBase64 } from 'lz-string';\r\n...\r\nexport function trimFormData(formData) {\r\n  const cleaned = { ... formData };\r\n  Object.entries(formData).forEach(([k, v]) => {\r\n    if (v === null

I have same concern.
