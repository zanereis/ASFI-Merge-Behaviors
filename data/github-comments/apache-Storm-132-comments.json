topology.disruptor.batch.size to 1, and setting topology.disruptor.batch.timeout.millis to something large like 1000.  If this works for you I will put some special case code for a batch size of 1, that should drop the CPU utilization back to where it was before, but you will also lose the increased throughput.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612629220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612628973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5027#issuecomment-2612628973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5027","id":2612628973,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2Mjg5NzM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-09T14:31:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:13:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>There is either a bug in thrift or you have a client server mismatch.

Niskode-Dossett</a> I am running this against master branch and there are no new files but its taking forever to complete. Also this will break our packaging process as we checkout the git repo everytime for our nightly builds.

I ran the following code on a mac book pro.  Using a 1ms sleep and 200 threads was using up 1/2 of the CPU.  Going to 300 threads was more or less a DDOS on the box.  This is very similar to what we are doing with the batching code.  Each disruptor queue has a dedicated Timer thread that sleeps for 1ms and then tries to flush anything in the batch.  Each bolt/spout instance has 2 disruptor queues so having 100 bolt/spout instances on a single box will result in 50% of the CPU, in this case, going to sleeping.  I'll see what I can do to make storm a not use quite so many threads when it does not need to.</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent

A single dedicated timer thread to which all bolts/spouts would register 'interest' and would tick or fire a callback on them every X milliseconds?  1 clock thread per worker to serve all the different DisruptorQueue tick needs.</p>\n\n<p>    What do you think of

The code is a bit complex.  When debugging these in the past the tests use simulated time, which is a great thing it lets us run tests that would take a long time very quickly, but to make it work properly there are some critical points where we wait for the simulated cluster to be idle.  Typically we see timeouts happen here, waiting for the entire cluster to stop.  But for some reason on really slow hardware, that I don't totally understand yet, this does not always happen. and increasing the timeout does not always induce it to be in that state.\n\nI am +1 on merging this in, but I am not totally sure that it will \"fix\" the problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/155431246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
