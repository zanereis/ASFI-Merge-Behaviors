was running into some issues where there were timeouts in the Pulsar client application logs. The Pulsar brokers were restarting. This was happening in a load test and it seemed that the broker restarts made the problem worse.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the issue, the brokers were recently configured to use zookeeperSessionExpiredPolicy=reconnect setting. The broker zookeeper timeout related settings are at the default values (zooKeeperSessionTimeoutMillis=30000, zooKeeperOperationTimeoutSeconds=30), since it seems odd that the Zookeeper interactions would take longer since the CPU consumption looks very low on zk in the load test. \r\n\r\nNow, we reran the load test and the brokers became unavailable. The logs were filled with this type of errors:\r\n```\r\n07:37:09.740 [pulsar-zk-session-watcher-5-1] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.zookeeper.ZooKeeperSessionWatcher - timeout expired for reconnecting, invoking shutdown service\r\n07:37:11.740 [pulsar-zk-session-watcher-5-1] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.zookeeper.ZooKeeperSessionWatcher - timeout expired for reconnecting, invoking shutdown service\r\n07:37:13.741 [pulsar-zk-session-watcher-5-1] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.zookeeper.ZooKeeperSessionWatcher - timeout expired for reconnecting, invoking shutdown service\r\n07:37:15.741 [pulsar-zk-session-watcher-5-1] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.zookeeper.ZooKeeperSessionWatcher - timeout expired for reconnecting, invoking shutdown service\r\n```\r\nThis is with `zookeeperSessionExpiredPolicy=reconnect`. Previously with the default setting (`zookeeperSessionExpiredPolicy=shutdown`), the broker would resume operations after a restart. Now all brokers in a 3 node cluster get unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of using `zookeeperSessionExpiredPolicy=reconnect` is that now it was possible to get a thread dump from the system when it got unavailable, although the broker didn't ever resume operations.\r\n\r\nIn the thread dump, there are quite a few hanging threads. Some stack traces are similar to what #8406 fixes. \r\n```\r\n\"ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7\" #1258 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f67a09f9000 nid=0x50a waiting on condition [0x00007f676c258000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (parking)\r\n\tat sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\r\n\t- parking to wait for  <0x000000044ca60338> (a java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture$Signaller)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:175)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture$Signaller.block(CompletableFuture.java:1707)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.managedBlock(ForkJoinPool.java:3313)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.waitingGet(CompletableFuture.java:1742)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.get(CompletableFuture.java:1908)\r\n\tat com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.LocalAsyncLoadingCache$LoadingCacheView.get(LocalAsyncLoadingCache.java:400)\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.common.naming.NamespaceBundleFactory.getBundles(NamespaceBundleFactory.java:160)\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.namespace.NamespaceService.getBundle(NamespaceService.java:192)\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.namespace.NamespaceService.isTopicOwned(NamespaceService.java:913)\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.namespace.NamespaceService.isServiceUnitOwned(NamespaceService.java:877)\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.BrokerService.checkTopicNsOwnership(BrokerService.java:1359)\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentTopic.subscribe(PersistentTopic.java:521)\r\n```\r\nFull thread dump of broker:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/lhotari/ba9c45cf4111a66f5e8960df4955bbf8\r\nOnline thread dump report: https://jstack.review/?https://gist.github.com/lhotari/ba9c45cf4111a66f5e8960df4955bbf8\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm bringing this up in this issue is that a Zookeeper timeout exception in the broker logs can actually be caused by threads hanging in the broker. Hopefully #8406 gets also fixed in the upcoming Pulsar 2.6.2 version\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I now noticed that there's an incoming PR #8304 (fix for #4635 which is also a deadlock).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/719460964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/719465473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6251#issuecomment-719465473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6251","id":719465473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTQ2NTQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-30T10:14:32Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T10:14:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some of the Zookeeper related issues in the broker might get fixed by #8406 .

Cool.\n> Do you see improvements in the overall execution time?\n\n@eolivelli \nI'm still investigating and experimenting. The `discard` and deletes isn't the root cause. I assume it will help.\nMy current assumption is that the build uses too much IO. The cache action pulls in almost 4GB m2 repository files for every single job. Because of that 4GB/jobs x 20 jobs = 80GB of data transferred total across all workflows of a PR.\nThe Azure disk IOPS rate limiting might simply be kicking in. The reason why the speed varies so much might be that the Github Runner implementation caches the VMs and if the rate limiting kicks in with a delay or it's over a longer time window, it might be a previous build has already used some of the IOPS quota.\n\nI'll soon investigate why the m2 cache is almost 4GB. That's probably mostly a waste. The cache configuration needs optimization. I'll be modifying that and starting with an empty m2 cache.\n\nIn my experiment I also removed the config where unit tests are run inside a container apachepulsar/pulsar-build:latest. That image is hundreds of MBs and that also could be replaced with a more efficient solution. It seems that a few more unit tests fail when they are run on the Runner VM instead.\n\nI'll continue experimenting to see how different settings impact the performance. Making the build easier to maintain is also my goal. I'll be using build matrix feature to spin off multiple jobs of a single type. The amount of workflows can be reduced. Build steps can be shared with local composite actions stored in .github/actions directory.

explanation for this issue on the slack from @addisonj \r\n\r\n\r\nAddison Higham  2 hours ago\r\nis this in a single namespace? if so, then the reason for this is because it is all stored in single document, and because of the way the transaction log works, you are going to see a lot of churn with continuing to add to a single big document.\r\nFirst off, what is the use case you are trying to solve for? Are these all to unique roles?\r\nSecond, you might consider using namespaces to work around this\r\nFinally, if you want to support this easily today, you could implement your own authorization backend and use some alternative store and/or alternative way of defining all the calls. At some point, we expect to rework the build-in ACL implementation to not write to zookeeper\r\n\r\nalex kurtser  1 hour ago\r\nThanks\r\nActually we have lot of namespaces were each one can have up to 500 topics and the permissions there are per topic , not per namespace.\r\nIF all this information is stored in the single document, it make sens why we  see lot of write transactions.\r\nI don;t know if we can implement now our own authorization back-end..\r\nwe will think how to change the design in order to find some workaround\r\nDo you know about the ETA for the eliminating the using of zookkeeper for the permissions store ?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/720669835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/720670509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8419#issuecomment-720670509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8419","id":720670509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDY3MDUwOQ==","user":{"login":"alexku7","id":42849762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQ5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42849762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7","html_url":"https://github.com/alexku7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-02T19:13:35Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T19:13:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So
