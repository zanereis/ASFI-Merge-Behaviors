don't have to since the float32 is the default setup. In most cases, we use float type in training. And the image is normalized into range [0,1]. float32 here means typical single precision float type, while float16 represents half precision float point. It requires less memory on GPU and runs faster for some Nvidia GPUs with half precision units. However, due to the loss of precision, the performance could be worse than single precision one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/326553972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/326557606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7699#issuecomment-326557606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7699","id":326557606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjU1NzYwNg==","user":{"login":"hyxie6","id":16114511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTE0NTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16114511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6","html_url":"https://github.com/hyxie6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxie6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-01T11:29:43Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T11:29:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the
