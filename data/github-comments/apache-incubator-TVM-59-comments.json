ASan alongside with instrumentation pass requires runtime part, which allocates shadow memory and manages it like poison/unpoison and so on. The place of the shadow memory depends on your OS and architecture, we can face really hard bugs with it.\r\nI personally faced some issues:\r\na. ASan's runtime was not initialized before instrumented binary/library - which cause a segfault.\r\nb. GDB maps binary with PIE to ASan's shadow on 32 bit ARM Tizen OS.\r\nc. Broken \"fast unwinder\" on 32 bit thumb https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2018-09/msg00312.html?fbclid=IwAR0hP_a3kFdCZbwMq07kjQnhoPdfg_3MZZya9roPYy8l8I46rpZjgj3TMM4\r\nAnd so.\r\n2. ASan officially does support 32 bit and 64 bit ARM only for Android, so other OS requires to have patched version of ASan's runtime.\r\n3. GPU support? Depends on how it allocates memory, some issue https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1037466/cuda-programming-and-performance/cuda-runtime-library-and-addresssanitizer-incompatibilty/\r\n\r\nSo, IMHO that every architecture which TVM supports and every new architecture would require to custom ASan's runtime, but otherwise if we need just x86/x64 it should be ok.\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437588831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437602628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2079#issuecomment-437602628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2079","id":437602628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzYwMjYyOA==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-10T17:49:40Z","updated_at":"2018-11-10T17:49:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Overall this is very good work @denis0x0D!

Finally, I got a little bandwidth so that I could return here. The workloads to refactor the interfaces and glue it to an `OpNode` are far beyond my expectation.\r\nI am struggling for two missing pieces:\r\n1. After putting a lowered body to an `ExternOp`, I face a paradox: the `ExternOp.output(i)` will return a tensor which points to the `ExternOp` itself, which means this tensor has the same name as the `ExternOp`. However, this tensor has its own name defined by the users `a=output(shape, dtype)`.\r\nI can either:\r\n    - Add a rename pass to make it compatible with `ExternOp` interface\r\n    - Add my own `HybridOp` and overwrite `.output(i)` member.\r\n2. The in-place thing, actually, it is redundant to return this tensor again in the output list. The contribution of the function has been delivered implicitly by the side effect. My suggestion is that we just put it in the input list, and we do not put it in the output list. **I believe TVM has no global (inter-op) check which leverages the input/output information based on side-effect free assumption.**\r\n\r\nIf 2.'s bold assumption is not true or not acceptable for further extension of this project, I will pick the second solution in 1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437652235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437678991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2079#issuecomment-437678991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2079","id":437678991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzY3ODk5MQ==","user":{"login":"denis0x0D","id":25140014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQwMDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25140014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D","html_url":"https://github.com/denis0x0D","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-11T15:19:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T15:19:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen

I am thinking how to even simplify this further, to consider most user's use case.

redundant\r\n   - If in most cases users could use the python runtime to debug, would it sufficient to provide a simple python callback function\r\n   - Alternatively, a C++ PackedFunc version of log_to_file callback would be cleaner than the flag parsing + global print logic.\r\n- For example, would it be sufficient to allow a user to register tvm_trace_callback into the PackedFunc, and only trigger the callback when necessary? \r\n\r\nHere is a mock up version of the code.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import trace\r\n\r\ntvm.register_func(\"tvm.trace_callback\",

it would be great to start a coordinated effort on this. as you said, the graph IR, tensor IR, code generation, hardware ISA and hardware organization all have to be designed in concert to make this work.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to push for posit support in the next TVM release cycle. I am happy to work on this coordinated effort to get this supported on the hardware end. Right now VTA is specified in Vivado HLS, which is not really the right abstraction level to replace the implementation of customized datatypes (unless Vivado provides support for posits, in which case we're in business).\r\nThere is an effort at UW which will port the VTA design to the Chisel DSL, which will make it very flexible for us to support unconventional floats. Posit support will be a top priority.\r\n\r\nFor the TVM, and graph IR components, it would be good to gather @tqchen 's and @jroesch 's thoughts. I presume that as long as the posit representations are powers of two wide, it should be fairly similar to supporting fixed-point representation (at least in terms of data layout). There is an on-going effort to make 8-bit inference supported in Relay, and from there we'll work on sub-8bit graph support, such as 4bit, 2bit and 1bit integers.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437738805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437769756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2089#issuecomment-437769756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2089","id":437769756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzc2OTc1Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T06:22:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T06:22:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vinx13 can you also elaborate a bit on possible use-cases of this pass?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437769756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/437790489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2089#issuecomment-437790489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2089","id":437790489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzc5MDQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T08:06:25Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T08:06:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I guess a bigger kernel is better for performance.
