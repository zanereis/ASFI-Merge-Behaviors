reviewing this, I think Gremlin Server needs a change. When we submit a remote traversal. Gremlin Server needs to check for `iterate()` in the bytecode and actually call `iterate()` rather than `next()` that way the graph instance gets the right method called on it for any additional optimization that could occur there. Plus, if the client did call `iterate()` it's better that Gremlin Server simply return no results - that's a big optimization. I can work on that change and just commit it to this branch as part of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/344936587/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/344941656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/748#issuecomment-344941656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/748","id":344941656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDk0MTY1Ng==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-16T14:38:25Z","updated_at":"2017-11-16T14:38:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/344941656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/345061407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/748#issuecomment-345061407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/748","id":345061407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTA2MTQwNw==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-16T21:02:42Z","updated_at":"2017-11-16T21:02:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we over engineered this ticket.

nice to see how easy it is to implement a DSL in Gremlin.Net and I like your suggestion to simply create another version of `__` to deal with the fact that we can't extend it in C#.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is to change the name of the classes in the examples that contain extension methods to end on `Extensions` as that is a convention in C#. So `SocialTraversal` would become `SocialTraversalExtensions` and `SocialTraversalSource` becomes `SocialTraversalSourceExtensions`.
