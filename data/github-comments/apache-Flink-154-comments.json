Then `StreamExecutionEnvironment.fromCollection(rows, type)` should work quite well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274582959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274583698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3125#issuecomment-274583698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3125","id":274583698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDU4MzY5OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T19:01:11Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T19:01:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for opening this pull request.

I really like the idea of deduping code at that level, but I don't think that we can merge this as it is. What's the current state of the things that depend on this for the Mesos dispatcher? And how much code is actually duplicated there? I think that this generifcation only works well for Flink's data exchange layer and your new additions.\r\n\r\n- In general, I think that bootstrapping a Netty client/server is very easy and in most cases you actually don't need to configure that much. For example in the queryable state network client and server, the setup of the client and server are only a couple of dozens lines.\r\n- The centralized `NettyConfig` and protocol work well for projects in `flink-runtime`, but you don't want to always couple this. For example with a separate slim module for the queryable state client, this would require it to depend on `flink-runtime` if it wanted to use it.\r\n- Futhermore, we are moving to using the `ConfigOption` gathered in `<Component>Options` classes (like `HighAvailabilityOptions`).\r\n- This also would not work with the web runtime server where we don't even have a client.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I just don't think that the approach taken for trying to make the data exchange network layer generic with the \"protocols\" and \"configurations\" was a good idea in the first place when we implemented it a few years ago.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat about moving to the generic components to the Netty based components you require for the Mesos dispatcher (e.g. make it part of the dispatcher PR) and leave the current data exchange implementation as it is.\r\n\r\nI would keep the SSL handlers separate in order to allow users to easily use them as you suggest.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274772995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/274776453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3199#issuecomment-274776453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3199","id":274776453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDc3NjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T11:17:06Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T11:17:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Gyula!

For now I have handled by returning the Int, Float, Long - Min_values. But that may not be right I believe.

all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275065201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275065306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3198#issuecomment-275065306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3198","id":275065306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTA2NTMwNg==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-25T09:55:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T09:55:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright,

I think I have addressed all the comments here. Feedback/comments welcome. I also found that it is better to use the TableInputSplit to specify the start and end row so that the scan is anyway restricted to the given range. (Hit submit before completing). But the filterabletableSource is mandatory to convert the WHERE clause to suitable scan range. Also we should handle any WHERE clause that gets applied on the columns only (not based on rowkey) - say where age > 10. Then the qualifier with the name 'age' may have to do some comparison by injecting some filters into the scan.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275075022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275075555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3149#issuecomment-275075555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3149","id":275075555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTA3NTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"ramkrish86","id":3690658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTA2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3690658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86","html_url":"https://github.com/ramkrish86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-25T10:42:02Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T10:42:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske , @tonycox , @wuchong -
