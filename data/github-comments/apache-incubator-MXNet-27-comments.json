C++ interface cannot be directly exposed in DLL/.so files, since the\n   compilation environment might be different when compiling libmxnet and when\n   compiling applications, leading to application crash due to ABI violations.\n   This of course can be solved by forcing the user to always compile mxnet\n   from source and use the same environment to compile application, but not\n   really desirable: building libmxnet is painfully slow.\n2. The C api is a minimum interface. It provides apis such as\n   CreateSymbols(char*, ...), instead of mx.sym.FullyConnect(...) as provided\n   in Python. So users has to lookup the symbols first, which currently is not\n   documented at all. I think we should wrap those libraries so they look more\n   like Python interface.\n\nI am not familiar with Cmake either.
