As part of my research, I made an API that lets you update RDF triples and issue SPARQL queries by automatically transforming them into RDF-star triples and SPARQL-star queries with timestamps attached. The RDF-star triples look like this:\r\n```\r\n<< << <http://example.com/s> <http://example.com/p> \"o\">> :valid_from \"2023-02-06T12:00:00\"\"^^xsd:datetime >> :valid_until \"9999-12-31T12:00:00\"^^xsd:datetime  .\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing two nesting levels, I can attach a creation and deletion timestamp.\r\n\r\nI also tried the more intuitive and semantically correct approach:\r\n```\r\n<< <http://example.com/s> <http://example.com/p> \"o\">> :valid_from \"2023-02-06T12:00:00\"\"^^xsd:datetime .\r\n<< <http://example.com/s> <http://example.com/p> \"o\">> :valid_until \"9999-12-31T12:00:00\"^^xsd:datetime  .\r\n```\r\nHowever, with this approach the datasets are bigger due to the redundancy (repetition of the data triple) and the query performance is worse in GraphDB 9.3 and JenaTDB 4.3.2. So I decided to go with the nested quoted triple.\r\n\r\nMore infos:\r\nAPI: https://github.com/GreenfishK/starvers\r\nEvaluation of the RDF-star and timestamp-based versioning approach: https://github.com/GreenfishK/starvers_eval (still ongoing)\r\nPaper submitted to SWJ: http://semantic-web-journal.org/content/starvers-versioning-and-timestamping-rdf-data-means-rdf-approach-based-annotated-triples (major revision going to be submitted soon)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1418642723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1421294971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1749#issuecomment-1421294971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1749","id":1421294971,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5Utz17","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-07T19:00:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T19:00:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"HI @SimonBin ,\r\n\r\nI haven't seen this issue, but I will try to reproduce it locally.

The latter will perform a production build, that involves some optimization.\r\n\r\nFrom the comments from that issue you linked, and after your tests, I think it confirms there's something in the build chain that is causing this loading issue in the generated assets.\r\n\r\nHere's what I would try (you can try if you have time, but I will do so over next days when I have time):\r\n\r\n1. Change `pom.xml` and `package.json` to produce a development build instead of a production build.\r\n\r\nWhen you run `yarn run build` or `npx vite build`, you should be able to see a log line like \"vite v4.0.4 building for production...\". You can change the build mode with `npx vite build --mode development` or `yarn run build --mode development`. You can change the arguments of the Maven execution `yarn run build` of the `frontend-maven-plugin` plug-in.\r\n\r\n2. Review the build options of Vite, trying some out and seeing if any fixes the issue (or makes it always happen).\r\n3. Try what was mentioned in the issue you linked.\r\n4. Not my favorite, but sometimes I have to read the source code of Vue/Vite/etc and hack my local copy or check it out and build it locally + link to test things out... just in case nothing fixes it.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n-Bruno","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1426854564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1426870013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1751#issuecomment-1426870013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1751","id":1426870013,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5VDE79","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-11T20:26:18Z","updated_at":"2023-02-11T20:26:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just from looking at the code ... it's probably to isolate the iterator from `deletions` changing while the iterator is iterating.

So it can do the full OIDC flow where you get redirected off to your OIDC provider, authenticate with them and then get redirected back.  That's only practical for UI based use cases.\r\n\r\nA lot of Fuseki usage is as an API server, often without any UI running.  In this use case the immediate user of Fuseki is some HTTP client library which is not necessarily going to understand OIDC flow nor is it necessarily sensible for it to do so.  In those use cases you really want users to provide their HTTP library with a token (which they already obtained somehow) and have it pass that to Fuseki with its requests.\r\n\r\nThe goal of what has been put into Fuseki core was to provide an extension point whereby people can add Bearer token verification if they so desire.  While I appreciate the desire to have a non-code way to do this I don't think there's an obvious solution that covers both use cases (UI and API) in a practical fashion that isn't horribly complex for the end user regardless.\r\n\r\nAnd for context at my $dayjob we're deploying Fuseki in AWS with Cognito as the authentication provider.  This uses JWT Bearer tokens for authentication **but** this being AWS it passes them around in completely non-standard HTTP headers, and makes the public keys for verification available in a non-standard way.  So we have custom code for token verification plugged in via Fuseki modules.\r\n\r\nUltimately Bearer Authentication, and OIDC in particular, are non-trivial to configure, while Jena has security features, it isn't itself, and shouldn't be a security framework.  Even if we added support for configuring the simplest possible setup it wouldn't cover most real-world setups and once you support something feature creep likely sets in.

I will keep it in mind for certain use cases. However, in this particular one, I am looking for an open-source triplestore with GeoSPARQL support (like Jena) to import ~50Milion triples to run GeoSPARQL queries offline as there is some health data involved. Any advice would be welcome.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred to use geosparql-fuseki for the full GeoSPARQL support but if it does not support named graphs I might try to use jena-fuseki with GeoSPARQL enabled. Is there a ready to use fuseki server with GeoSPARQL enabled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1465688239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1465769964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1791#issuecomment-1465769964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1791","id":1465769964,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5XXd_s","user":{"login":"SimonBin","id":10867832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY3ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10867832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonBin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-13T09:13:42Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T09:14:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navarral if you are working with named graphs then of course select * ?s ?p ?o will turn up empty! try ```select * { graph <https://example.org/graph-A> { ?s ?p ?o } }```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1465769964/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1465815029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1791#issuecomment-1465815029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1791","id":1465815029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5XXo_1","user":{"login":"navarral","id":74778335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Nzc4MzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74778335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral","html_url":"https://github.com/navarral","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navarral/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-13T09:45:55Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T09:45:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You are right!
