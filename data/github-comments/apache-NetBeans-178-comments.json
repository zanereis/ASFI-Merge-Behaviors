I would like to sum up the fundamental testing conclusions:\r\n1. The FINEST does not solve the issue for anyone completely, it does however \"calms down\" the frequency of the bug appearance.\r\n2. The \"ghost\" copy workaround always solves / resets the state of the copy/paste session in any scenario.\r\n3. @bradvido 's testing code is accurate and always reveals the issue, with the FINEST enabled or not. Just use at least 256 iterations to get 1-3 appearances of the bug if FINEST is being used. Set the timing to something lower in order to shorten execution time and repeat if there is no faulty result. Keep in mind that the case where FINEST will not workaround, test code will reveal the issue clearly from the first 10 iterations. If the FINEST will act as the \"frequency reduction workaround\" the appearance is random, I estimate an average appearance of 1/50 to 1/100 copy/paste sessions but that is an empirical mixed conclusion from testing with the test code and real usage observations.\r\n4. -J-Dorg.netbeans.NbClipboard.level=FINEST\" works from windows shortcuts and at the level of netbeans.conf but watch out for typo mistakes.  LogMan  plugin can switch logging states in realtime, no need for restarts.\r\n5. It is only present on Windows. Never reported on other platform as far as I can see, so there might be a jvm trap somewhere in the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\nedit: I do not know what kind of randomness is being introduced in the FINEST log flag, in practice now I get 1/15 to 1/25 fails (started at a much better fail rate as seen in my notes), It is still an improvement with FINEST but even this \"improvement\" fluctuates significantly. Test code shows this also. This proves that even in the same system FINEST will give controversial results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood luck to the brave developers that will investigate this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1677296777/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1677398743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6335#issuecomment-1677398743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6335","id":1677398743,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5j-xLX","user":{"login":"lahodaj","id":51319204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5MjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51319204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj","html_url":"https://github.com/lahodaj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-14T14:13:47Z","updated_at":"2023-08-14T14:13:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The best is to have a way to reproduce - that it can be reported against javac and fixed there (and it is not rare that bugs like this are fixed in javac).

(I just tested it and it seems to be the case)\r\n\r\nMigrating the code index is risky since it could cause problems. NB will also reset the java index if the nb-javac version changes so there would not be much gained. Other languages editors might have similar constrains.\r\n\r\nMigrating the maven index so far would likely cause incompatibilities if the lucene version changed between releases, and it would reset automatically if the index can't be loaded. NB 19 is the first version which will ship with lucene codecs for backwards compatibility (#5931) which would allow to read old index versions. Moving the index is not implemented yet since the index itself is now more compact - so we do want a reset there, but it is something we discussed before and could be considered in future. \r\nThe index extraction is now faster, can be filtered (#5922) and can run multi-threaded, so it might not be a large enough problem anymore to justify index migration.\r\n\r\nOpening files which were opened in the last NB version might be unfortunately not straight forward to implement, due to the way UI persistence is implemented. (Projects should automatically open though). But I agree this would be nice - I remember looking at this in past but got distracted by other things.\r\n\r\nIn general: importing settings from older versions is fairly risky and is already causing problems (#6094, ...).
