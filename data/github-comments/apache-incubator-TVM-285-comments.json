I just started to deal with the mechanics of TVM and it is quite possible that some of the questions are pretty stupid.\r\n\r\nI cut  a Depthwise Conv2D with output (1, 56, 56, 128) from quantized mobilenet_v1 frozen graph (mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_frozen.pb),\r\nthen transform it to tflite and check a relay and TIR.\r\n\r\nThere is my relay for Conv2D:\r\n def @main(%MobilenetV1/MobilenetV1/Conv2d_2_pointwise/act_quant/FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars: Tensor[(1, 56, 56, 128), float32], %v_param_2: Tensor[(1, 3, 3, 128), float32], %v_param_3: Tensor[(128), float32]) {\r\n  %0 = qnn.quantize(%v_param_2, 0.0605373f, 160, out_dtype=\"uint8\");\r\n  %1 = qnn.dequantize(%0, 0.0605373f, 160);\r\n  %2 = reshape(%1, newshape=[3, 3, 128, 1]);\r\n  %3 = nn.conv2d(%MobilenetV1/MobilenetV1/Conv2d_2_pointwise/act_quant/FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars, %2, padding=[1, 1, 1, 1], groups=128, channels=128, kernel_size=[3, 3], data_layout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWOI\");\r\n  %4 = nn.bias_add(%3, %v_param_3, axis=3);\r\n  %5 = clip(%4, a_min=0f, a_max=6f);\r\n  %6 = qnn.quantize(%5, 0.0235285f, 0, out_dtype=\"uint8\");\r\n  qnn.dequantize(%6, 0.0235285f, 0)\r\n}\r\n\r\nBut it differs from the relay in your bug report.\r\nThen I checked relay from the whole mobilenet: (from mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_frozen.pb and then from mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite also),\r\nBut I haven’t found a relay like yours in the whole mobilenet relay on my side (tried to find “int16” or “fixed_point_multiply” lines).\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that we are using tflite quantizer (“qnn.quantize”, “qnn.dequantize” in the relay from our side)\r\nI suggest you use another quantizer, because there are no “qnn” lines in your relay.\r\n\r\nMy questions on the above problem are:\r\n1. It seems that you have a different version of tvm than mine, please indicate in which commit did you get this error?\r\n2. Which quantizer did you use?\r\n3. Please tell me why relays are different?\r\n\r\nThe next part of my question is regarding large allocations\r\n1.\tIn which place in the code do you check TIR? (TIR primfn on my  side also differs, not at all, but in some parts) \r\n2.\tCould you please give me an example when op fusion is correct\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nArina Naumova,\r\nSoftware developer, Grovety\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907596350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907596657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8871#issuecomment-907596657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8871","id":907596657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42GNNx","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-28T08:57:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T08:57:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe @antinucleon has some experience (painfully) migrating python to C++ :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907596657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907600180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8586#issuecomment-907600180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8586","id":907600180,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42GOE0","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-28T09:28:23Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T09:28:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @ganler!

However, we have moved that involves relay traversal implementations (bar the pattern rewrites -- because the python hook is just an interface and I believe the rewriting is actually happening in C++) to C++ while maintaining a python interface to cater the integration. Performance was the consideration to move the pass impl to C++.

I don't think it removes our ability to infer devices based on Target when there is no ambiguity, and it provides us a language in which we can warn the user when ambiguity exists.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910036578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910118010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8795#issuecomment-910118010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8795","id":910118010,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42P0x6","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T09:44:40Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T09:44:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding point 3, it is indeed required for P3.

If some of the tools in contrib require a lot of testing functionality, then I think it would make sense to break it out, but so far it's only been single functions here and there.\r\n\r\n> @leandron: In general LGTM. I remembered we have another test that can be marked with this new decorator, in tvmc.\r\n\r\nThank you for pointing that out, and I've updated it as well.  A quick grep doesn't show any other folders that reference ethosn, so we should be set there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910354261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910371659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8865#issuecomment-910371659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8865","id":910371659,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42QytL","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T15:01:54Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T15:01:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Gentle ping...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910371659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910427372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8866#issuecomment-910427372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8866","id":910427372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42RATs","user":{"login":"luyaor","id":7541296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDEyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7541296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor","html_url":"https://github.com/luyaor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyaor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T16:02:01Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T16:02:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"updated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910427372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/910437701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8898#issuecomment-910437701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8898","id":910437701,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42RC1F","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-01T16:13:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T16:13:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This looks nice!

Some of the directory decisions were made to loosely align with the VTA integration (another TVM-powered ML accelerator). In that, special 'VTA versions' of certain operators are defined in the VTA directory which are tightly coupled to the VTA target and compilation pathway. We have much the same concept for Ethos-U - Tensor Expressions which make sense for our target and pretty much nothing else. I think because of this, putting them into TOPI could cause confusion as they're treated very differently from all the other TOPI ops.
