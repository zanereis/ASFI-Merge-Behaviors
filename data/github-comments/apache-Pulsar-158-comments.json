the `http://` protocol will only redirect your client to a direct/pod/ClusterIP `pulsar://` address, which will never work (unless you use EKS thru a VPC bridge -or- you have hardcoded your Broker URLs into the Proxy)\r\n  - only the 'pulsar://` endpoint provides reverse proxying to the Brokers (but it needs a TCP load balancer, so e.g. you can't use Traefik 1.x to load balance multiple Proxies)\r\n  - if your Brokers don't use SSL encryption, so can't your Proxy, because the the protocol type is carried thru Proxy, so you'll end up having to use unencrypted access thru public internet\r\n  - due to these:\r\n    - you'll really want to use only a small, single Proxy in your cluster for some external testing\r\n    - for production use you'll want to expose the Pulsar Brokers on `NodePort`s, but since the Brokers do redirection for requests on topics they don't serve, you need to either:\r\n      - set the `advertisedAddress` variable on the Broker to externally lookup-able hostname (in the context of your pulsar client) (the current Helm chart doesn't offer to do this, because you need to set a different one for each Broker)\r\n      -

They are upgrading the cluster to 2.5.0 and run the test again. \r\n\r\nRegarding the feature you introduced in #3985, we have asked them to try it out. However they can't really predicate the traffic and set a good publish rate in advance. Hence we are looking for a better solution at the broker level.

However I do have known the history of pravega. Here are some of my thoughts. Hope that is helpful to you.\r\n\r\nThese two projects have very different scopes. Pulsar starts from a Pub/Sub messaging system and evolves into a full-fledged event streaming platform, including unified pub/sub and streaming, infinite streaming storage (via tiered storage) and light-weight computing (via functions). Pravega is designed for a streaming storage only. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, Pulsar can be used for traditional queuing workloads and newer streaming workloads. You can use Pulsar to unify your existing legacy messaging and streaming technologies. However Pravega is only for streaming processing. \r\n\r\nBoth of systems use bookkeeper. However they are using bookkeeper in a very different way. Pulsar uses bookkeeper as the segment storage and moves the data from bookkeeper to tiered storage when data is aging out. bookkeeper and tiered storage are decoupled. You don't need a tiered storage run Pulsar, but if you want to use tiered storage feature, you can easily turn it on.\r\n\r\nHowever Pravega uses bookkeeper only for WAL and tiered storage as the main storage for storing the data. That says you need both bookkeeper and an additional storage system for running Pravega. \r\n\r\nThe differences of using bookkeeper results in performance and efficiency differences. IMO, Pulsar uses bookkeeper in a more efficient way than Pravega.\r\n\r\nBesides the main two differences, Pulsar provides Pulsar Functions, Connectors and Schema Management, Geo-Replication for people to easily build reliable messaging and streaming applications. \r\n\r\nHope this is helpful to you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/549228776/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/549228917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4025#issuecomment-549228917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4025","id":549228917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTIyODkxNw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-04T05:35:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T05:35:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closed
