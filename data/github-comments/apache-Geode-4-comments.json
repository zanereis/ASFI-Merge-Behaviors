I was especially concerned about the change in redirects from ../doc to ../guide. Local bookbinder bind works. Bookbinder 'watch', which worked for me before, throws errors from various Ruby gems. Not sure that support for bookbinder 'watch' is important, so maybe this doesn't matter. Sample of errors:\n\n$ bundle exec bookbinder watch\nGathering geode-docs\n  copying /Users/dbarnes/Repo/incubator-geode/geode-docs\n\nRunning middleman...\n\n== The Middleman is loading\n== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.1.80:35729\nE, [2016-10-21T11:30:42.281013 #71727] ERROR -- : exception while processing events: Is a directory @ io_fread - /Users/dbarnes/Repo/incubator-geode/geode-book/output/master_middleman/source/guide Backtrace:\n\n -- /Users/dbarnes/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/middleman-core-4.1.10/lib/middleman-core/util/binary.rb:70:in `read'\n\n -- /Users/dbarnes/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/middleman-core-4.1.10/lib/middleman-core/util/binary.rb:70:in `file_contents_include_binary_bytes?'\n\n -- /Users/dbarnes/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/middleman-core-4.1.10/lib/middleman-core/util/binary.rb:38:in `binary?'\n\n -- /Users/dbarnes/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/middleman-core-4.1.10/lib/middleman-core/sitemap/resource.rb:175:in `binary?'\n\n...and so on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/255438690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/255443549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/267#issuecomment-255443549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/267","id":255443549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTQ0MzU0OQ==","user":{"login":"davebarnes97","id":13138489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTM4NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13138489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97","html_url":"https://github.com/davebarnes97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-21T19:11:08Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T19:11:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Correction - bookbinder watch did not work reliably for me, so this PR does not introduce a new problem.\nRe-verified that local bind yields good output.\n\nIMO, OK to accept this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/255443549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/255861302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/269#issuecomment-255861302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/269","id":255861302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTg2MTMwMg==","user":{"login":"joeymcallister","id":16106577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA2NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16106577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister","html_url":"https://github.com/joeymcallister","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeymcallister/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-24T20:47:15Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T20:47:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR is complete.

Adding appropriate blank lines and indenting the fixed width text sections by 4 spaces will make the last section's 4 numbered items appear as 1, 2, 3, 4.  They currently appear as 1, 1, 1, 1.\n- the first of the 3 commands to embed the User Guide into the website content (what will be step number 2) is missing a period at the end of the command.\n  The _incorrect_ commands:\n\n```\n   $ tar cvf ~/Desktop/new-guide-content.tar\n   $ cd ../../../geode-site/content\n   $ tar xvf ~/Desktop/new-guide-content.tar\n```\n\nThe correct commands are\n\n```\n   $ tar cvf ~/Desktop/new-guide-content.tar .\n   $ cd ../../../geode-site/content\n   $ tar xvf ~/Desktop/new-guide-content.tar\n```\n\n_Note:_  when merging in this PR to a current develop branch, there will be a conflict (as noted in the PR) on the subnav.

Thanks for the review,\r\nI think I messed up in my local git repo. I am always getting \r\n```\r\n~/source/open/incubator-geode (feature/GEODE-1122) $ git flow feature finish -rF GEODE-1122\r\nBranches 'develop' and 'origin/develop' have diverged.\r\nFatal: Branches need merging first.\r\n\r\n```\r\nI tried rebase and other solutions, but nothing is working.\r\nCould you please help this time to merge this change to develop.
