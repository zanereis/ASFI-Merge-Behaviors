On a higher level point, I notice that we log this pattern `0.0:4.0 (TID 4 ...)` quite often, where the task ID is logged twice. If the user has no idea what the colon notation means, they might try to (as I did) interpret `4.0` as something else other than the task ID because `TID 4` is already there. I wonder if it makes sense to just drop the second TID.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48848292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48848503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1393#issuecomment-48848503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1393","id":48848503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODQ4NTAz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-13T18:37:25Z","updated_at":"2014-07-13T18:37:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1393:<br>\\- This patch FAILED unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds the following public classes (experimental):<br>case class Rating(user: Long, product: Long, rating: Double)<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/16604/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48848503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48849034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-48849034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":48849034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODQ5MDM0","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-13T18:56:56Z","updated_at":"2014-07-13T18:56:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @CodingCat looks good to me.\nMy only doubt, which we discussed last, was whether we want to differentiate between tasks which have no locations at all vs tasks which have preferred location but none available.\nCurrently both of these are hosted in the same data structure.\n\n@lirui-intel do you have any thoughts on this PR ?

That being said, we still need something this PR provides to delay tasks in the noPref list, because valid levels are not re-computed when task finishes. So it may contains, say, PROCESS_LOCAL even when such tasks have actually run out.\n\nI agree that we may want to separate tasks without preference vs tasks whose preferred location is not available.

In general, I think this patch can be simplified by using akka only for the driver-executor heartbeats. We should also clarify that `HeartbeatReceiver` is only for the driver, and document the new configs you introduced (`spark.executor.heartbeat.interval`).\n\nHave you looked at how large each new heartbeat is? `TaskMetrics` is supposed to be small when we first added it, but now it carries many more things than what it used to. If someone dumps a huge block that kicks out many old blocks on the executors, for instance, the heartbeat would include the list of all the blocks that are displaced, which could be large. There has been a problem recently with akka frame size, and I was wondering whether that might be a concern here too.\n\nCould you upmerge this (again) once you have the chance? Thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48867225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48867486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1397#issuecomment-48867486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1397","id":48867486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODY3NDg2","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-14T05:53:00Z","updated_at":"2014-07-14T05:53:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

But leaving it out entirely yields no runtime binding at all -- no logging. There is an argument for not including any SLF4J runtime dependency in Spark at all, and which requires users to add their own to get any log messages. Debatable -- but a different question.\n\nSLF4J is a bit of a funny example though. What about other runtime dependencies? jets3t is a good one. It has to be on the runtime classpath, so needs to go into a runtime assembly JAR. It does not need to appear on the compile classpath, and shouldn't ideally. \n\nThis is not the same as \"provided\" scope, where the user is expected to bring the artifact from the local environment.\n\nWhat's the standard SBT magic for
