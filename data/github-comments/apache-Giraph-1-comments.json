Creating an OutEdges instance gets called a number of times in the order of the number of vertices. Now, this becomes an issue when the the creation of a new OutEdges instance does some expensive initialization, e.g. accessing parameters from the configuration can sometimes be expensive. With the factory, one can essentially cache this, upon the instantiation of the factory, and then pass the cached value to the OutEdges instance.\r\n\r\nI've tried this with an application that does such an expensive operation adding mainly memory overhead, and the difference in performance is significant.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/giraph/issues/comments/362042556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/giraph/issues/comments/362052150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/giraph/pull/57#issuecomment-362052150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/giraph/issues/57","id":362052150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjA1MjE1MA==","user":{"login":"yukselakinci","id":30702587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzAyNTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30702587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci","html_url":"https://github.com/yukselakinci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yukselakinci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T19:58:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T19:58:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are you not planning to implement caching as part of this check-in?
