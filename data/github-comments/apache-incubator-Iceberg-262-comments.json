Maybe we just switch this case to handled by `commitDeltaTxn` regardless of the `replacePartitions` value.\r\n\r\nI do not have enough time nowadays to write and test the patch, but if you have time to write it, I will try to find time to review it.\r\n\r\nCC: @stevenzwu, @hililiwei ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1617384809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1617391414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7924#issuecomment-1617391414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7924","id":1617391414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85gZ282","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-03T05:40:03Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T05:40:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you try to add the missing jar to the class path with the `ADD JAR` command.

I think we should be good here. \r\n\r\nThe requirement to have all table snapshots consistent at the starting time of transaction is not a hard requirement in the definition of snapshot or serializable isolation.\r\n\r\nFor the non-repeatable or phantom read issue raised, the issue has to happen in a repeated read of the same table in the same transaction. So in the example I gave, table2 is only read once, so whatever state is at the catalog load time could be considered the valid status and not a non-repeatable or phantom read.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 cases which could cause phantom read:\r\n\r\n1. a self join query\r\n2. multiple reads to the same table in a multi-statement transaction\r\n\r\nIn the first case, although not strictly enforced, but most query engines cache the metadata when fetching table from catalog, so it is not possible to read new data in the second scan of the table. This is something that ideally engines should enforce, but definitely not something that catalog should enforce.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, a multi-statement transaction must implement the proposed transaction API, so we should be good there.\r\n\r\nI will continue to think about any other edge cases, but at least we are not blocked by this.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1619156336/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1619282753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6464#issuecomment-1619282753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6464","id":1619282753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ghEtB","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T00:13:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T00:13:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

By design, Iceberg forbids list operations on the filesystem. This is because Iceberg is object-store-oriented, and list operations are expensive.

That way you could get the same result, but it is clear that you're doing something that is dangerous.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nio = ArrowFileIO(**config)\r\nmetadata_location = recover_metadata(\"s3://bucket/path/to/table\", io)\r\ntable = StaticTable.from_metadata(metadata_location, config)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1620797933/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1620799248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7984#issuecomment-1620799248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7984","id":1620799248,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85gm28Q","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T22:35:10Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T22:35:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.
