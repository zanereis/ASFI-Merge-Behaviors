1 != 1\" \r\n```\r\n(remove semicolons behind WHERE 1 != 1 which  not allowed in oracle)\r\n2、return value of connection.getMetaData().getIndexInfo includes a null name record most times but not always . So IndexMetaDataLoader#load needs a check for whether indexName is null. \r\n```java\r\n    public static Collection<IndexMetaData> load(final Connection connection, final String table) throws SQLException {\r\n        Collection<IndexMetaData> result = new HashSet<>();\r\n        try (ResultSet resultSet = connection.getMetaData().getIndexInfo(connection.getCatalog(), connection.getSchema(), table, false, false)) {\r\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\r\n                String indexName = resultSet.getString(INDEX_NAME);\r\n                if (Strings.isNullOrEmpty(indexName)) {\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n                result.add(new IndexMetaData(indexName));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n3、connection.getMetaData().getColumns in ColumnMetaDataLoader#load need specify a schema, otherwise it will return duplicated columns, so that I use connection.getSchema() replace null.\r\n```java\r\n        try (ResultSet resultSet = connection.getMetaData().getColumns(connection.getCatalog(), connection.getSchema(), table, \"%\")) {\r\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\r\n                String columnName = resultSet.getString(COLUMN_NAME);\r\n                columnTypes.add(resultSet.getInt(DATA_TYPE));\r\n                columnTypeNames.add(resultSet.getString(TYPE_NAME));\r\n                isPrimaryKeys.add(primaryKeys.contains(columnName));\r\n                columnNames.add(columnName);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nit is works to me. Can we discuss further how to modify it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/623866759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/623870616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5421#issuecomment-623870616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5421","id":623870616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzg3MDYxNg==","user":{"login":"TaoZhiMLND","id":9602831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDI4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9602831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoZhiMLND","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoZhiMLND/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-05T06:00:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T06:00:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lvye351 hi, you can have a try like above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/623870616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/623876042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/5426#issuecomment-623876042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5426","id":623876042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzg3NjA0Mg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-05T06:20:55Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T06:20:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 11420](https://coveralls.io/builds/30560114)\n\n* **2** of **2**   **(100.0%)**  changed or added relevant lines in **2** files are covered.\n* No unchanged relevant lines lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage remained the same at **57.134%**\n\n---\n\n\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/30560114/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/30560114) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 11418](https://coveralls.io/builds/30559365): |  0.0% |\n| Covered Lines: | 11973 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 20956 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -

found some infomation may explain the use of semicolon in Oracle JDBC. This means that a semi-colon is not needed, and as it is not part of the actual statement syntax for a lot of database it is also a syntax error to include it. \r\n\r\n>   Usually the semi-colon is not part of the actual syntax of a statement (as most database internal APIs execute a single statement at a time). Instead the semi-colon is an 'end-of-statement' marker or statement separator that is - usually - defined in CLI or scripting tools for the database. This allows that tool to know when a statement ends, so it can send that single statement to the database for execution.\r\n  On the other hand, the JDBC api is intended to execute a single(!) statement at a time, therefor you don't need such a separator (the statement is the whole string). This means that a semi-colon is not needed, and as it is not part of the actual statement syntax for a lot of database it is also a syntax error to include it. Some JDBC drivers will strip the last ; from a statement to 'fix' that, some drivers don't.\r\n  Some drivers allow - contrary to the JDBC specification - multiple statements to be executed as a single string, this usually has to be enabled with a connection property, for example for MySQL it is the option allowMultiQueries (see the MySQL properties for details).\r\n\r\nOriginal answer link
