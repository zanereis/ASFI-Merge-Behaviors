It sounds like it's just a matter of how we store record level hashes. The bloom filter stored in one cache record is necessary but the size is fixed regardless of the data set size. It's only driven by the capacity set on the bloom filter during the initial configuration. We could set that value to have a maximum to help protect the user from corruption. Storing individual hash sets for each record is obviously an option with this implementation already but it's good to be able to use Bloom filters because I think there will be scenarios for people don't care about exactness in unique records because it's primarily used to eliminate a lot of duplicate data processing.

for reviewing @tpalfy and @exceptionfactory.\r\n@exceptionfactory I don't think we can really unit test this. I mean, we could write a test that verifies that if connected to a cluster, that `controller.onClusterDisconnect()` gets called. But it's pretty clear that it does given the code snippet:\r\n```\r\nif (controller.isConnected()) {\r\n  controller.onClusterDisconnect();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don't think an integration test would really be any more help. A system-level test could potentially be written. I may consider that as a follow-on. But given that it's easy to verify the fix manually and @tpalfy and I have, I don't think it's worth holding up the PR for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/717443793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/717444273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4602#issuecomment-717444273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4602","id":717444273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzQ0NDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T18:30:25Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T18:30:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging based on @tpalfy +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/717444273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/717465968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4625#issuecomment-717465968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4625","id":717465968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzQ2NTk2OA==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T18:55:48Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T18:55:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Assuming the build process works out - code changes make sense.

inspects the keystore and finds the private key entry and gets the alias automatically, if more than one private key entry exists then an exception is thrown (nifi already assumes a single private key

I avoided introducing that as one of the data types when originally creating the Record API. What I think makes far more sense is a more general notion of restrictions of types. Consider, for example, how XSD allows you to add a restriction to a base type. We want to eventually support specifying schemas using XSD, and we'll need to support this notion in order to make that happen. I would certainly favor introducing that notion now over introducing an Enum. Then, when converting an Avro schema into a RecordSchema, we could do so as a restriction on the String type. This provides far more power and flexibility when using schemas, such as specifying that an int must be in the range of 1-100, and this then becomes extremely powerful when coupled with something like ValidateRecord.\r\nAdding an enum at this time, IMO, makes this a bit awkward, because it is then a specific type whose purpose is to introduce a restriction on another type (I.e., it is basically a Restriction on a String type).

Not sure if that is the reason for the \"extra\" 200 in the 19,200 limit as compared to the second test that limited at 19,000. \r\nEither way, this limitation should be addressed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/724788240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/724825411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4570#issuecomment-724825411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4570","id":724825411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDgyNTQxMQ==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-10T16:46:25Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T16:46:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfrazee we should be all good now.
