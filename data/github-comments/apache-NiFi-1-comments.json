I pulled the patch and looked it over. Was looking at ma=\nking just a few very minor tweaks to be a big more consistent with the code=\n style that we typically use.\nThe only thing that I really would like to change -- and I dont know that w=\ne can -- is that the artifact id becomes the name of the directory that the=\n project goes into. So if I want to create a processor bundle called \"fire\"=\n for instance I'd want to call it \"nifi-fire-bundle\" for the root directory=\n. So I'd enter that as the artifact id. But then we want the sub-modules to=\n be named \"nifi-fire-processors\" and \"nifi-fire-nar\" without the \"-bundle\" =\npart there. I don't see any way to do this in Maven.\nI considered maybe offering an 'artifact-base-name' property so that the su=\nb-modules could be named '${artifact-base-name}-processors' and '${artifact=\n-base-name}-nar' so that the artifact base name in this example would be 'n=\nifi-fire'.\nDoes anybody have a better approach for this?\nThanks-Mark\nchetype for...\nor-bundle-archetype.\nifi)=2C you can test the archetype like this:\nhetypeArtifactId=3Dnifi-processor-bundle-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=3D0.0=\n.1-incubating-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=3Dorg.apache.nifi -DartifactId=3Ddonothing=\n -Dversion=3D1.0\n.Processor\nocessor\nor-bundle-archetype.\nyour\ne\nplease\n                      =\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/71035182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/71037873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/11#issuecomment-71037873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/11","id":71037873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMDM3ODcz","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-22T15:30:12Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T15:30:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Mark, I agree about the naming of the top level directory being annoying.

The items in /nifi/LICENSE are only for source dependencies.  Will adjust that prior to merging.  Initial pass of all deps/licensing/notice looks good though.

Can let it get refreshed during the next onTrigger.\n- EvaluateJsonPath: Instead of pulling some set batch size use the @SupportsBatching annotation and the framework can take care of this for you and will do so in a manner that favors user defined tolerances for latency vs throughput.  In addition this removes the need for the for loop, the flowfileloop goto, etc..  But it does make the previous suggestion more important (caching compiled JsonPaths)\n- Another contributor has provided an auto-documentation mechanism.  Not sure of its status for being pulled in just yet though. In the mean time please consider adding documentation pages in src/main/resources/docs....\n- EvaluateJsonPath: Line 207.  Is exception handling the only possible option for handling/detecting this?  Exceptions create a shocking amount of stress on GC and overall JVM performance at rate.  Having exception handling be key to the flow control will greatly limit the applicability of this processor for truly high volume processing.  If there is no alternative it is probably worth documenting this fact as a caveat for users to know in the docs for the processor.  If you'd like to see just how horrible exceptions are for throughput of the JVM do a simple test of Integer.parseInt to parse a String (when some of the inputs could be non-Integers) vs a regex to test first if it appears to be an Int then using Integer.parseInt.\n- EvaluateJsonPath: Consider telling the provenance event reporter if you modified the content of the flow file and providing some details about the change.\n- SplitJson: Exception based handling again to be avoided if possible.\n- Both Processors: It appears to be that the library will load the full input stream in memory then return results, splits, etc..  If so that provides important information about its applicability on large JSON documents.  If so please document this concern with the processor so users can consider this and its impact to the heap/memory space.\n- SplitJson: Consider telling the provenance event reporter that the splits are forks from the original.\n\nSummary: Really good stuff here.  This will be a very helpful processor.  Please consider making the suggested modifications.  I will push to origin this new branch NIFI-360.  Please modify off that and we can work from that PR.

I don't want to wait too long and have the pull/merge get painful if things continue to change on develop.\n\nDan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/76871131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/82102342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1#issuecomment-82102342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1","id":82102342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTAyMzQy","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-17T04:37:36Z","updated_at":"2015-03-17T04:37:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"just merged this PR into origin/NIFI-190  It is all up to date with latest develop now.

I believe though the copyright mention should be 'Copyright (C) 2008-2013 10gen, Inc.' as that is what they had in their LICENSE addendum section for the version you've chosen.\n\nIs there any reason not to go straight to 3.0.x driver series?\n\nThanks!\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/100324870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/100329244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/53#issuecomment-100329244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/53","id":100329244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDMyOTI0NA==","user":{"login":"tequalsme","id":855471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTQ3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme","html_url":"https://github.com/tequalsme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tequalsme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-08T19:01:49Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T19:01:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good eye, Joe. I was about to comment on a couple of things for this pull request:\n\n1 - I wasn't sure what exactly the verbiage should be in the NOTICE. I guessed based on their website, and it looks like I guessed wrong. I'll get it from their LICENSE and update.\n2 - I am using embedmongo-maven-plugin for my unit tests. I want to make sure it's ok to introduce this new dependency, could someone validate? https://github.com/joelittlejohn/embedmongo-maven-plugin\n3 - The 3.0 Java driver series was released a month ago and has a brand new API (that I have not used). The 2.x API is still supported but marked deprecated. I though it best to go with 2.x than to introduce a slew of deprecation warnings. But, since these processors are so simple, maybe it would be best for me to use the new API.\n\nThanks for reviewing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/100329244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/100330127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/53#issuecomment-100330127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/53","id":100330127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDMzMDEyNw==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-08T19:06:52Z","updated_at":"2015-05-08T19:06:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tim\n\n1) You did a great job.

The reason we used 'isDebugEnabled' was because that was the use case in which the stack trace was necessary (because they were debugging).   Given that you can edit logback config on the fly this seems like a reasonable approach.  But taking away their ability to control this as the effect of this proposal means they're getting the stack traces whether they want them or not.  This can cause very excessive and noisy output in the logs.\n\nDo you have an alternative proposal for how we can retain the flexibility of letting the administrator toggle the stack traces?\n\nThanks\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/105560569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/105625875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/59#issuecomment-105625875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/59","id":105625875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTYyNTg3NQ==","user":{"login":"brianghig","id":297404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzQwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/297404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig","html_url":"https://github.com/brianghig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianghig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-26T18:29:33Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T18:29:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Joe,\n\nWe could use filters within the Logback configuration to turn on/off Throwables or any granularity of Exceptions.

I have found the default NiFi\nlogging configuration to be almost always logging the wrong things.  I most\ndefinitely always want stack traces to be logged, because it's sometimes\nvery hard to recreate the state by which the stacktrace was thrown.  And\nit's a pain to have to change the logging level (even at runtime) just to\nhope that the stacktrace happens again.\n\nWhereas I almost never want all the existing framework INFO messages\nlogged.  I don't care anything about how many wali objects were garbage\ncollected, what the current state of each processor is, or if a heartbeat\nwas sent or received from a cluster configuration.  The things that one\nmust ignore when grepping a log often hinders the ability of finding the\nthing you are looking for.\n\nA stacktrace, by definition, is more than a DEBUG level event.  It is at\nminimum a WARN if not ERROR condition in almost all standard cases.

Should have included the caveat, \"this is a developer's point\nof view.\"  But my point of view is definitely not at the expense of\n\"appreciating\" the operations side as well.  Your point that the provenance\ntooling mitigates the need for verbose logging of individual flowfiles is\nspot on.  Before the provenance tracking, logging the history a flowfile\n(via its uuid) across the entire flow was critical for both developers and\nespecially operations.  Now, not so much.\n\nMy comments were definitely made in the context of having the provenance\nrepository to track the life of a flowfile event.  Having the provenance\nevent database clearly shifts the utility of the log files way over to the\ndeveloper side and less the operations side.  Perhaps identifying what\nuseful operations-based logging still remains would be a good thing.\n\nAnd since we're talking about provenance events, it would likely make sense\nas well to provide the tooling to enable \"grepping\" of the provenance event\nlogs, so that unix style commands can be piped together in the same way\nyou'd do with plain text logs.  Perhaps a command line provenance client\nwould be useful to the operations toolkit and would further reduce the\n(ab)use of the log files?\n\nAdam\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/105641278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/105759226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/59#issuecomment-105759226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/59","id":105759226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTc1OTIyNg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-27T05:12:19Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T05:12:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Adam Taft  on dev@nifi.incubator.apache.org replies:\nYou got it.\n\nNIFI-634 and NIFI-635 created, as per output from this discussion.\nComments welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/105759226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/105879635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/59#issuecomment-105879635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/59","id":105879635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTg3OTYzNQ==","user":{"login":"danbress","id":10684595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjg0NTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10684595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress","html_url":"https://github.com/danbress","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danbress/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-27T11:38:39Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T11:38:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"A couple comments\n\n1) Does this pull request have a JIRA ticket associated with it?\n\n2) As a developer I also share Adam's developer viewpoint.
