I've been using the NHWC schedule written by @cowanmeg, which can be found in the quantized_end2end branch of her TVM fork (https://github.com/cowanmeg/tvm/tree/quantized_end2end). Maybe she can chime in on what works well for NHWC.\r\n\r\nThank you @jwfromm. I have taken a look at [the code](https://github.com/cowanmeg/tvm/blob/quantized_end2end//topi/python/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d.py#L369) (wish not using a wrong one), which is very similar to this PR. Still, I am very curious about the 5X performance, would you please share the detail of getting the performance (I will try @cowanmeg 's schedule too)? As mobilenet1 with NCHW can get 121 ms on Raspberry Pi 3B ([TVM benchmark page](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/wiki/Benchmark#results)), 5X means ~25 ms, which outperforms many *fast* quantization optimization approaches I think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/532932258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/532940453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3925#issuecomment-532940453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3925","id":532940453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjk0MDQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-19T02:39:13Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T02:39:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MarisaKirisame I guess this is caused by the use of reference.
