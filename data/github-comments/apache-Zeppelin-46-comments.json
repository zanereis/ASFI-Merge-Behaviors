I will confess, I haven't tested the html functionality in quite a while-the reason is, anyone who wants html displayed, i can't think of a reason they wouldn't use the knitr interpreter. But it should work. \n\nRegarding the locked environment error, it seems like you've loaded a package that has a dependency on a package that defines a \"Person\" object.  What happens when search the namespaces for Person?  But honestly I've never seen that error before.\n\n> On Mar 10, 2016, at 5:46 PM, Jeff Steinmetz notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> To confirm, are you saying this should return Zeppelin displayed html?

This is why the magic isn't working as you expect-R is adding formatting. If you write the string with cat() instead of print, it should work, and I'll fix if it doesn't.\n> \n> However, in R, html is generally created using the 'html' class. If an object of class 'html' is returned by this interpreter, it is passed to Zeppelin with the %html magic for native display. \n> \n> This is necessary to handle some kinds of interactive visualization. It also means the interpreter will properly display html created by R packages in the manner the user expects. \n> \n> While I'm somewhat open on this issue as well, I'm pretty sure that the current design is the one that R users will find the most natural. \n> \n> > On Mar 10, 2016, at 3:59 PM, Jeff Steinmetz notifications@github.com wrote:\n> > \n> > This doesn't work as I would expect:\n> >

was just trying  some of these. Looks like with this solution there would be queue built up for running multiple paragraphs in parallel for Spark. And that essentially causes huge slowness when multiple paragraphs are running in parallel. It is a big road block for multi-tenancy.\n\nMy suggestion is to create multiple processes for Spark Interpreter but limit it/link it to user instead of notebook. So for every user there should be a separate interpreter process instead of for every notebook. As we are also having PR on user authentication and authentication in place achieving this should not be a problem.\n\nRegards,\nSourav\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/197444164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/197466910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/781#issuecomment-197466910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/781","id":197466910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NzQ2NjkxMA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-16T18:18:25Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T18:18:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Merge
