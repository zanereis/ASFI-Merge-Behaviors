A developer quickly creates a webaction from an existing action (i.e. set web-export annotation to true), but leaves the action logic alone.   When the webaction is invoked without an extension (defaults to .http), the response will contain JSON that does not have a `body`, but does have one or more fields - none of which are `statusCode` or `headers`.  Currently, the status code is 200 with no body, which may lead to some false positives regarding the actual action success.\r\n\r\nIn this developer-error scenario, I suppose this could be viewed as a content type mismatch.  The request expected a webaction HTTP response, but actual response was free form webaction JSON.  Since the webaction invocation extension is involved in specifying content type, a response that does not adhere to the request is mismatched.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/294515038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/294529791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2132#issuecomment-294529791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2132","id":294529791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDUyOTc5MQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-17T17:05:32Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T17:15:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`return {statusCode: 400}`\r\n`return {body: \"...\"}`\r\n`return {headers: {\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": \"*\"}}`\r\n`return {}`\r\n\r\nAll are plausible and reasonable responses -

Our ansible script has both of them covered. However, we have no support of openwhisk installation under windows. When ansible is deploying openwhisk under either mac or ubuntu, the CLI is built based on the OS openwhisk is running on, so either we build CLI locally for mac or ubuntu, which means there is a sort of no chance to build the windows CLI. This is basically how the current ansible for cli build works.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the deployment of openwhisk can be under mac or ubuntu, but the cli can be installed under another machine, when they are separate. However, our deployment of openwhisk put the openwhisk and cli on the same machine. That is why we do not have the chance to reach windows cli.\r\n\r\nOne approach to improve this can be the host machine, where cli will be installed, checks the OS, and pull the cli binary accordingly. I guess we can do the OS check in the ansible script, and download the binary based on the OS of the host machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/296220923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/296224793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2131#issuecomment-296224793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2131","id":296224793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjIyNDc5Mw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T15:35:57Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T15:36:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can build the cli for all hosts regardless if the host environment. @dubeejw can help.
