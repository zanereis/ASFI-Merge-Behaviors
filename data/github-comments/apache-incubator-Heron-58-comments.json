I've noticed something else about TriggerPolicies that I had missed on my first go round.  There is no way for the API user to actually instantiate an instance of a custom TriggerPolicy to put it into the WindowConfig object because they would first need to have a reference to the WindowManager to act as a TriggerHandler.  I'm writing a commit attempting to address this now.\r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/355845819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/355856988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2499#issuecomment-355856988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2499","id":355856988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTg1Njk4OA==","user":{"login":"erenavsarogullari","id":1437738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzc3Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1437738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari","html_url":"https://github.com/erenavsarogullari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erenavsarogullari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-07T22:11:08Z","updated_at":"2018-01-07T22:11:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @skanjila ,\r\n\r\nFirstly, thanks for sharing the plan.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in Heron Scala API support so we can work in parallel by splitting to subtasks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your list, i think the following changes as the part of roadmap:\r\n\r\n**1-** Bazel Integration for Heron-Scala\r\n\r\n**2-** 3 level Bazel BUILD files:\r\n```\r\n/heron/examples/src/scala\r\n/heronheron/api/src/scala\r\n/heronheron/api/tests/scala\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3-** Scala Traits:\r\nI think you have already started by converting from Java Interface.\r\n\r\n**4-** Scala Implementations:\r\nJava interface and Scala trait function signatures will be different. I think java specific logic (eg: SerializableFunction, SerializablePredicate..) need to be wrapped by hiding from Scala users and expecting pure scala functions so these logic can be covered in Scala Impls. These conversions can be implicit or explicit in the light of the final decision.\r\n\r\n**5-** UT Coverages with ScalaTest\r\n\r\n**6-** Scala Examples (under examples module)\r\n\r\n**7-** Documentation for end users\r\nThe Heron Streamlet API for Java - https://twitter.github.io/heron/docs/developers/java/streamlet-api/\r\n\r\n**8-** Load Tests\r\nThis can be useful to verify if any perf overhead exist or not)\r\n\r\nAlso, i think we don' t have Jira support to track issues so this kind of list can be documented (via proposal doc or another Scala tasks doc) and addressed step by step by Github-issues ;) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/355856988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/355859813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2658#issuecomment-355859813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2658","id":355859813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTg1OTgxMw==","user":{"login":"joshfischer1108","id":5785700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5785700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108","html_url":"https://github.com/joshfischer1108","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-07T22:53:14Z","updated_at":"2018-01-07T22:53:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I should also mention that most of the this code is based off the Apache Storm Flux implementation.
