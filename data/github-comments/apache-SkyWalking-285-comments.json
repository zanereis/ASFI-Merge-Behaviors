How will I test the created docker image? The docker images are getting created using the `buildx` command and I am able to run it but is there any command to run in the docker container to run the test cases?\n\nNo, the final docker image is for end user' use so there is no test case in that image anymore. Just feel free to run the `license-eye version` and if it succeeds it's ok enough. \n\n> 2.  Do we need to really use `buildx` command to build the docker image and not just when pushing it? As the --load keyword will not create multiplatform images, so we can just use the normal build command as we will not be creating a builder then removing it at the end,\n\nWe don't have to. Using `buildx` for both loading and pushing is just for simplifying the script if you find it simpler to use plain docker build for local build and buildx for publishing, just do it!\n\n> 4.  In the MakeFile the [docker-release](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/blob/00b35e521822654568ab65d93cced7a986e46bc6/Makefile#L82-L83) recipe already contains the docker build and push command then why is there another tag and push command? Can't just `docker-release : docker docker-push` work?\n\n`docker-release : docker docker-push` just works. As a convention, a Docker image will be also tagged as `latest` (if it's latest) so users can just run `docker run apache/skywalking-eye ...` without adding an explicit version, i.e. `docker run apache/skywalking-eye:0.6.0 ...`.\n\n> 5. Do we need to change architecture for build recipe too? As I can see we are creating [`ARCH`](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/blob/00b35e521822654568ab65d93cced7a986e46bc6/Makefile#L22) variable but then [overriding](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/blob/00b35e521822654568ab65d93cced7a986e46bc6/Makefile#L36) it by `amd64` value.\n\nThe first `ARCH` is just for [determining the OS](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes/blob/00b35e521822654568ab65d93cced7a986e46bc6/Makefile#L23) and the second one is real ARCH. Sorry they have the same name to confuse. You can also rename one of them in your PR.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the build recipe as it only builds one arch variation for macOS, which I expect it should generate for both amd and arm.
