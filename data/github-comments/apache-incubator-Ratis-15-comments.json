We tested this patch, but we found that calling `updateFlushedIndexIncreasingly()` after the flush cause \r\nratis performance is almost the same as synchronous flush.

But I I want to know if we can add a switch to allow users to choose whether they can accept sacrificing a little security in exchange for higher performance.

One is to notify install snapshot, and the other is appendEntries thread(sending heartbeat and entries).\r\n\r\nThe statemachine installing snapshot(let's say thread A) and return progress of installing snapshot(lets say t thread B) are asynchronous. The update of the index(commit index and next index) is executed serially by thread A. \r\nIn practice, the statemachine installing snapshot takes increasing time to finish. The main thread (thread B) will respond `IN_PROGRESS` during the install, but once the install is done, the follower needs a new request to return  `SNAPSHOT_INSTALLED`, since the last request should have already replied IN_PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we keep the non-blocking style to let the follower respond to the leader with its instant status, there are two problems.\r\n 1. Once the snapshot is done, the updated index could be reached first by appendentries thread(lets say thread C), and C will return the updated nextIndex to the leader. The leader hence will misunderstand the status of the follower and not send the notification. The follower needs the new notification to send back SNAPSHOT_INSTALLED. The consequence is that thread B will get stuck, and thread C will wait for B done and always return INCONSISTENCY to the leader.\r\n\t\r\nMy solution: let update of index be executed by the main thread B, so the follower can ensure to send out the SNAPSHOT_INSTALLED after update of index.\r\n\r\n2. Currently, appendentries thread C return the `state.getNextIndex()` when snapshot installation in progress.  The nextIndex is calculated by Math.max(logNextIndex, snapshotNextIndex). Here snapshotNextIndex is got through server.getStateMachine().getLatestSnapshot(). We should return the index updated by main thread(thread B) instead of statemachine’s.\r\n\r\nMy solution: replace `snapshotNextIndex = getSnapshotIndex() + 1;` with `snapshotNextIndex = log.getSnapshotIndex() + 1;`\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1062522977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1062524549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/573#issuecomment-1062524549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/573","id":1062524549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc4_VNaF","user":{"login":"Xushaohong","id":10106574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA2NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10106574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong","html_url":"https://github.com/Xushaohong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xushaohong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-09T03:43:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T03:43:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![install_snapshot drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10106574/157368618-f3b30de4-1f9e-4d1e-a925-c09b5ee2ecab.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1062524549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1062524876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/616#issuecomment-1062524876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/616","id":1062524876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc4_VNfM","user":{"login":"SincereXIA","id":20393870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzkzODcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20393870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA","html_url":"https://github.com/SincereXIA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SincereXIA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-09T03:44:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T03:44:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Since FileChannel is thread safe, let's call FileChannel.force(..) asynchronously so that we don't have to synchronize all the output stream calls; see https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13040845/616_asyncFileChannelForce.patch\r\n\r\n@szetszwo , Thanks for your opinion.
