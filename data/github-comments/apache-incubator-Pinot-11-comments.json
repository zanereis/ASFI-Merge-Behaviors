Can specify the use-case for each of aggregation function, where we would like to aggregate on MV columns.\n\nFor use-cases, we have a use cases that required unique counting and group by both on multi-value columns. Say one user has multiple experiments, and multiple trips, instead of flattening both, I will explode my table row size. So I would like to do group by on the fly.\nAlso there is time series use case, which for the same dimension I need to access raw records as long as put on some aggregation functions. Think about I can do avg (trip_fare) for a user across arbitrary days window, if my data is daily \"aggregated\" to an array.\nLike:\nDAY | user_id | trip_fare\n1      |  aaa      | [1,2,3,1]\n2      |  aaa      | [1]\n3      |  aaa      | [10]\navg(trip_fare)  where DAY BETWEEN 1 AND 2 ==> 1.6\navg(trip_fare)  where DAY BETWEEN 1 AND 3 ==> 6\navg(trip_fare)  where DAY BETWEEN 2 AND 3 ==> 5.5\n\nIt's kind of trivial to support all the aggregation functions after unique counting is supported.\nI also have use case which is under discussion to index gpslogs(Very huge, more than 6B points daily). There are a lot of redundancy to store user_id, trip_id multiple times in a single trip.\n\n> 1.  Also, lets describe the semantics for each of those functions?\n\nFor each function:\ne.g we have a int array columnA with 100 rows, each row has two values [1,2].\n**count**: This is not really implemented as we rewrite the count(col) to count(*) during query parser. But want to support it to return total number of entries for a selected column.\n\n**sum**: sum up all the values in selected rows. sum(columnA) = 300\n\n**avg**: sum/count(all the multi-values): avg(columnA) = 300/200 = 1.5\n\n**min/max**: one value that is the min/max of all the values. min(columnA)=1, max(columnA) =2 \n\n**minmaxRange**: max-min. minmaxRange(columnA)=1\n\n**distinctCount**: unique values across all the values, distinctCount(columnA) = 2\n\n**percentile**: percentile based on all the values: percentile50(columnA) = 1;percentile90(columnA) = 2;\n\n> 1. How does this change impact performance of both (existing) SV columns and (new) MV columns? And how do we plan to measure throughput latency impacts.\n\nFrom my tests. This change doesn't impact SV columns perf, though there will be extra if check for each block, but I don't foresee any visible impact. For MV columns, we have predefined block, but need to read 1 row of multi-value for every selected docId. This will definitely be slow, but we will get benefit when we have filtering there. From data model part, we can compress multiple rows with same dimensions together and make metricsFields as multi-value fields(this is actually dimension and time based rollup).  But we need to prepare it in Hadoop before loading data to Pinot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/250341296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/250528967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/599#issuecomment-250528967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/599","id":250528967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDUyODk2Nw==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T17:05:03Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T17:05:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Overall, I think it's a good idea to have the ability to support aggregation function on MV. One suggestion is to create a new function instead of overloading existing function. I think there are enough nuances between single-value and multi-value columns that warrant this. This also allows us to add change/add new functions as its possible to have multiple ways define to compute average and other functions for multi-valued columns depending on the scenario. \n\nRegarding the batch vs reading a row at a time for MV, I think that deserves another issue and PR. For now, we can go with reading one row at a time for MV columns. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/250528967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/250538667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/599#issuecomment-250538667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/599","id":250538667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDUzODY2Nw==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T17:41:51Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T17:41:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To add more details.
