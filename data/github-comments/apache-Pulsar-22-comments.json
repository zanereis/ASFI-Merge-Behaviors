The main goal is that creating a ByteBufPair and writing it to the channel:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nByteBuf b = ... \r\n// b.refCnt() == 1\r\nctx.writeAndFlush(b); \r\n// When write is completed the object is automatically \r\n// released and  buffer is returned to pool\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith ByteBufPair it will be the same: \r\n\r\n```java\r\nByteBuf b1, b2;\r\n// b1.refCnt() == 1\r\n// b2.refCnt() == 1\r\n\r\nByteBufPair p = ByteBufPair.get(b1, b2);\r\n// Still\r\n// b1.refCnt() == 1\r\n// b2.refCnt() == 1\r\n// b.refCnt() == 1\r\n\r\nctx.writeAndFlush(b);\r\n\r\n// When writing, b1 and b2 get also incremented before the write \r\n// to compensate the intrinsic release\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the end, `b` gets released and deallocated, which will trigger the release of `b1` and `b2`.\r\n\r\nBottom line, when doing `ByteBufPair.get(b1, b2)` the current ownership (of 1 ref-count) for both `b1` and `b2` is transferred to the `ByteBufPair` instance. This is same behavior as previously with the `DoubleByteBuf`. The only difference is that previously we were doing `retain()` and `realease(2)`, but that doesn't change the counter math.
