Ninja Edit: I think the kafka topic written to should be pulled from zookeeper...\r\n\r\n@cestella I remember now why I settled on making the topic name a static configuration from the topology properties.  Our `BulkMessageWriterBolt` & `KafkaMessageWriter` classes seem to have been designed to only work with statically defined topic names.  I would have to change those core classes, if I want to set the topic name dynamically from Zookeeper.  And I tend to get smacked around when coming close to core classes :)\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?  Is there a way to define the topic dynamically while using the `BulkMessageWriterBolt` & `KafkaMessageWriter` classes unchanged?\r\n\r\nIf not, I'd prefer to keep the topic name as a static property defined in the topology properties, at least for this PR. My second choice would be to open a completely separate PR to update those core classes to accept dynamic topic names.  It does not seem like a complex change, but those are core classes and will likely cause some debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282028282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282029561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/449#issuecomment-282029561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/449","id":282029561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjAyOTU2MQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T15:48:00Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T15:48:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, I'm ok with that.

What we have indirectly tests that, but it relies on the ForkPool to work in a consistent way, which isn't going to happen.  Anyway, I pushed a commit, see how you like it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282061805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282062645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/463#issuecomment-282062645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/463","id":282062645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjA2MjY0NQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T17:32:36Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T17:32:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cestella that is a much better way of stating it, and exactly what I was alluding to.

So I googled \"file format .p\" and found it is probably a \"python pickle\" file, and indeed searching for \"pickle\" in the same commit found in dashboardindex.py uses of pickle.load and pickle.dump.\r\n\r\nSo it's not misnamed, and you were close with the .pyc guess.  The only question left is, does it belong there as a constant template file for the kibana dashboard?  Or is it an auto-gen file that shouldn't actually be in git?  That's a question for @dlyle65535 .\r\n\r\n@dlyle65535 answered in email:  \"It's the actual dashboard template in Python pickle format. Belongs in github.\"  Thanks, David!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282440139/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282440665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/405#issuecomment-282440665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/405","id":282440665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjQ0MDY2NQ==","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-25T00:18:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-25T00:18:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 on the fix btw.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282440665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282441109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/406#issuecomment-282441109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/406","id":282441109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjQ0MTEwOQ==","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-25T00:22:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-25T00:22:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DimDroll , yes, I just noticed in PR#405 that the comments were being correctly cc'ed to Jira even tho the title was different.

I wasn't able to reproduce the issue because my maven version was a couple minor releases behind (on 3.3.9 now for what it's worth).  Once I got past that the problem was obvious:  metron-common was bringing in shaded org.reflections classes directly and regular org.reflections classes transitively which are not compatible because guava is rewritten in the shaded classes, hence the NoSuchMethodError.  So for now the fix is to exclude org.reflections from the metron-common dependency and only depend on the shaded version.\r\n\r\nI had to merge several commits in so I'm still testing for regressions but this issue should be resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282791185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282791967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/441#issuecomment-282791967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/441","id":282791967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mjc5MTk2Nw==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T17:36:45Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T17:36:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 from me","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282791967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/282829067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/316#issuecomment-282829067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/316","id":282829067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjgyOTA2Nw==","user":{"login":"jjmeyer0","id":721593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/721593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0","html_url":"https://github.com/jjmeyer0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjmeyer0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T19:41:00Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T19:41:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@merrimanr Good catch on this.

Most error messages now go to the indexing topic by default so there is no need for another error indexing topology.  The error topic setting for the enrichment and indexing topologies are already exposed through flux properties so I left them there.  I added a \"parser.error.topic\" property to the global config for parser topologies (should indexing topic be the default if that property is missing or should we let it fail?).\r\n\r\nFor the concern about indexing errors getting in a loop, I thought of a simple solution that required no extra work.  If an error happens in the indexing topology, simply send it to a different error topic.  Would this be acceptable?  I wanted to throw this out there before implementing custom logic in the indexing topology classes.\r\n\r\nThe error message structure did change slightly.  In my testing I realized that the type for the \"raw_message\" field could be different (byte[] vs JSON) depending on where the error happened (pre vs post parse).  If an error message with byte[] as raw_message was indexed first, Elasticsearch would error on subsequent error messages with JSON as raw_message.  To address this, I serialized JSON raw messages before storing them in this field.  Now raw_message is always and string and raw_message_bytes is always a byte array.\r\n\r\nAll tests are passing and it has been tested in quick dev.  Some tips on testing the different cases:\r\n- the mock Bro sensor in quick dev contains a couple unparsable messages so parser errors should show up in the error index by default\r\n- Invalid parser errors can be generated by adding a field validation to the global config that will always fail \r\n- for testing indexing errors, copy a message from the indexing topic, change a field with number type (ip_src_port for example) to a non-number string, then put that message back into the indexing topic\r\n\r\n@cestella, would be good to get your opinion on the MessageGetter classes and where that ended up.  Not sure I love the syntax for default message getters.\r\n\r\nThe MPack changes are now minimal but it should still be tested there and that test is pending.  The documentation still needs to be updated so please don't merge this until that is done.
