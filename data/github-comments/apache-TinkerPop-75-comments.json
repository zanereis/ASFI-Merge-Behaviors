In this case, these changes would end up in the future 3.6.6 and 3.7.1 releases but not 3.5.8. I think this is the right choice as I would like to see 3.5.x get slowly phased out.\r\n\r\nI will try to find some time to review this later today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1688377000/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1688410100","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2215#issuecomment-1688410100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2215","id":1688410100,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5koxf0","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T15:24:23Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T15:24:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2215?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#2215](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2215?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (de96614) into [3.5-dev](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/ce88ce1a8f576d5d2114154951bf009b7e0285a0?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (ce88ce1) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             3.5-dev    #2215      +/-   ##\n=============================================\n+ Coverage      69.91%   69.93%   +0.01%     \n=============================================\n  Files            866       24     -842     \n  Lines          41068     3449   -37619     \n  Branches        5476        0    -5476     \n=============================================\n- Hits           28713     2412   -26301     \n+ Misses         10455      860    -9595     \n+ Partials        1900      177    -1723     \n```\n\n\n[see 842 files with indirect coverage changes](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2215/indirect-changes?src=pr&el=tree-more&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache)\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.

If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1692027492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1692043291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2212#issuecomment-1692043291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2212","id":1692043291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5k2ogb","user":{"login":"vkagamlyk","id":7605999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7605999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk","html_url":"https://github.com/vkagamlyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkagamlyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-24T16:38:32Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T16:38:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"are these changes only needed in 3.7?\r\n\r\nif so then VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1692043291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1692078753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2213#issuecomment-1692078753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2213","id":1692078753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5k2xKh","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-24T16:56:42Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T16:56:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@itaywol Thanks for coming back quickly and making those changes.
