Great work. Surprised that TVM can achieve such a good performance on cpu. I'm trying to reproduce the performance on more intel CPUs. So could you send out the benchmarks of TVM and mkl-dnn and the instructions to run them? BTW, I think it would be better to give the number of TFLOPS to show the computation efficiency of each implementation. It will also help to point out the optimization potential of each implementation by the ratio of computation effiency and the hardware peak TFLOPS.

So the mkl-dnn performance in the above table is measured including both memory reordering and convolution computation, right? It does make sense to take account of the overhead of memory reordering when measuring the performance of single operator. But if we look into a deep network in which all operators are supported by mkl-dnn, the memory reordering will only take place at the beginning and end of the computation path. So it will be a very small overhead for the whole network.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/364625293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/364632616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/883#issuecomment-364632616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/883","id":364632616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDYzMjYxNg==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-10T07:26:26Z","updated_at":"2018-02-10T07:33:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@TaoLv No. The mkl-dnn performance in the above table is measured without memory reordering, neither for TVM (for benchmark, we have the mem-reordering TVM schedule separate).
