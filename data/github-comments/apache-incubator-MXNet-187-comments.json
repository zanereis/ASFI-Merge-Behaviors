The issue is with how you're initializing your network weights. Specifically, it seems it's trying to initialize the values for your label variable, and it's complaining because it doesn't know an initialization strategy for a variable named label. Indeed, you shouldn't be initializing it, because it's a data input, not a weight :p \r\n\r\nSo the question is, why did this happen? My suspicion is that you're using Module and didn't tell it the right name of the label variable. (I would need to see your additional code to know) Consider that this is in the init method signature for Module:\r\n```\r\n def __init__(self, symbol, data_names=('data',), label_names=('softmax_label',),\r\n                 logger=logging, context=ctx.cpu(), work_load_list=None,\r\n                 fixed_param_names=None, state_names=None):\r\n```\r\nNote the default argument ` label_names=('softmax_label',)`. If you didn't set this value, then that's your problem, because in your case, your label variable is named 'label', not 'softmax_label'. Because it doesn't know that 'label' is the name of your label, it think it's a value to optimize, tries to initialize its value, and then complains because there is no defined strategy for parameters with the naming pattern 'label'.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: do this:\r\n```\r\nmod = mx.module.Module(loss, ..., label_names=('label',), ...)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/297545052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/297545606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5972#issuecomment-297545606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5972","id":297545606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzU0NTYwNg==","user":{"login":"jmacglashan","id":4700592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4700592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan","html_url":"https://github.com/jmacglashan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmacglashan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T21:24:49Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T21:24:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"P.S.
