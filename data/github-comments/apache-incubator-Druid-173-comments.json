(Vertica called it a \"projection\" because they were academic relational folks, and so to them, projecting also implied removing duplicates.)\r\n\r\nSummary tables tend to yield benefits if the number of rows decreases significantly, but their cost is additional storage and maintenance overhead. This would apply in Druid as in any other modern column-oriented database.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it is extremely important that summary tables are materialized views. That is, a user can write a query on the base data and the system transparently rewrites it to use the summary. This is important because it allows you to add/remove materialized views in future without breaking queries. We do this when we integrate Druid into Hive or Calcite; maybe Druid's native SQL (built using Calcite) could use Calcite's materialized views or lattices to achieve the same effect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/358432663/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/358456217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5230#issuecomment-358456217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5230","id":358456217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODQ1NjIxNw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-17T21:40:39Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T21:40:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @himanshug I don't think the druid.port at MM matters. The port finding logic in MM will find a available port before starting Peon. The druid.port won't be available at that time thus that port will be skipped.\r\n\r\nI remember this being an issue at least once for a customer. When MM starts , it would select ports for the tasks to be restored and spawn peon process ( which would go on to start server sockets) asynchronously... and at this point MM would also starts its own jetty server ... a port conflict could happen in this situation if MM `druid.port` and startPort were same. I never confirmed it because problem was solved by just incrementing startPort by 1, but most likely above theory would hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n> It occurs in a fairly low probability actually, but as our cluster becoming busier (more than 500 tasks at any moment), it's getting more serious, especially when working with tranquility, in which case tranquility will throw away a full segment of data.\r\n\r\nif you have multiple replicants and at least one of them runs successfully then such data loss shouldn't happen. that said, starting Druid-0.12.0 , using KafkaIndexingService for realtime ingestion would be a better choice for many other reasons as well.\r\n\r\n> I think it's not the problem of other services but a design flaw of Druid. In my opinion A better strategy may be Peon find a port and start the service itself and report to MM after that.\r\n\r\nI see your point, it could be improved.\r\n\r\nAll said, We run many clusters with many many middle managers and don't hit this problem. what is your startPort ? Also, you can run following command to see what is your host's ephemeral ports range.

Currently, it is done by many people by doing multiple ingestions to either create multiple dataSources from same input data .. or running batch `reindexing` on base dataSource. Clients don't directly talk to Druid, but to a Webservice on top of druid that handles query conversion.  ( I did https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3482 to add some convenience on creation of those multiple dataSources, it fell off my priority list but something that could be added )\r\nwhen user is doing it explicitly, they know exactly what is happening and the results they are getting.\r\n\r\nif Druid does above automatically then it needs to be able to handle various scenarios related to updates made to base dataSource which is doable but would definitely add more complexity to querying logic.\r\n\r\nThink about following scenario...\r\nbase dataSource A is indexed for interval Day1 , its segments have some version timestamp T. In the background, Druid submitted a job to create derived dataSource \"A-Deriv\" .. and around the same time user sent another indexing job for dataSource A for Day1... there is no guarantee that \"version timestamp\" generated for the segments for \"A-Deriv\" would be smaller than that of version timestamp of updated segments in A. Typically they are comparable for the same dataSource but not across because locking etc is per dataSource.\r\nand, there might be other such corner cases to handle.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/358481628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/358520768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5218#issuecomment-358520768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5218","id":358520768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODUyMDc2OA==","user":{"login":"zhangxinyu1","id":12528894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTI4ODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12528894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxinyu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T02:47:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T02:47:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov \r\n\r\n> I think your proposition with \"transparent\" data source names and special handling on historical query side is too complex.\r\n\r\nHistorical node doesn't do anything.

We store realtime metrics, each having 5 dimensions. We poll them every 5 minutes and store values of that metrics in druid (with `queryGranularity` = 5 minutes), ending up with 25Gb of data per day. Then someone come in and say that \"I want to be able to look at metrics for one month\". Well the problem in that case is that druid have to look via 30days*25Gb=750Gb of data to get about 200 points to fit them into graph.\r\n\r\nThen we realized that for that kind of tasks we better create a new data source with `queryGranularity` like 1 hour, but we better have some extra metrics along side, like minimum and maximum value during hour. So we decided to re-index all our existing data to create an new data source called `reindex-1h`, for example. Re-indexing task seems to be the solution.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that we cannot achieve that via re-indexing because each time our metrics, both new and existing one, are 0 in result :(\r\n\r\nYesterday I manage to get at least `count` metric to be non-zero, but `val` is always 0. I cannot use the same specs as in primary data source since in primary data source we have `val` metric defined as\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"type\": \"longSum\", \"name\": \"val\", \"fieldName\": \"value\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause we have `value` field coming from kafka, and we store them as `val` in druid.\r\n\r\nSo I tried this as `metricsSpec` \r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"name\": \"count\",  \"type\": \"count\" },\r\n{ \"name\": \"val\",    \"type\": \"longSum\",   \"fieldName\":\"val\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"name\": \"count\",  \"type\": \"count\" },\r\n{ \"name\": \"value\",    \"type\": \"longSum\",   \"fieldName\":\"val\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it gave `count` metric > 0 but `val` was still zeroes all the time.\r\n\r\nSo unfortunately it seems that we cannot re-index old data so that it could have couple more metrics
