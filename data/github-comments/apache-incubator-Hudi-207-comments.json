At C4, data_file1_V1 will be cleaned up. At C5, data_file1_v2 will be cleaned up. \r\n\r\nNow, lets take a look at how insert overwrite works. \r\nLets say you trigger insert overwrite table at C10. \r\nhudi will create a new file group. data_file2_v1 with just the new incoming records. and mark all previous file groups as invalid. \r\nSo, when hudi is queried now, only data from data_file2_v1 will be served and nothing else. \r\n\r\nAt some later point in time, when cleaner kicks in, it will clean up all invalid file groups. \r\n\r\nSo, actual clean up is lazy. And thats why you may see more file keeps getting added w/ every commit. \r\n\r\nInsert_overwrite_table: entire table contents will be replaced w/ current batch. \r\ninsert_overwrite: represents insert overwrite matching partitions. Lets say your hudi table has 1000 partition. and you are ingesting records in 100 partitions with \"insert_overwrite\", only the 100 partitions will be over written w/ new data. rest 900 will remain intact. \r\n\r\nHope this clarifies things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1050314304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1050337360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4839#issuecomment-1050337360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4839","id":1050337360,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-muBQ","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-24T22:47:52Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T22:47:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yeah. we don't have a good solution at the moment. it might the for each batch as you are going w/, but it may not use the streaming sink flow. but the streaming sink (w/ async table services) in general works for one table at a time.

If your queries mostly have predicates around dates, its wise choice to partition with dates. \r\n\r\nEven your ingestion might speed up depending on your partitioning strategy.\r\n\r\nFor eg, if your dataset is date partitioned, and if your incoming records have data only for 5 partitions, index lookup happens only among the 5 partitions. but if your partitioning is complex and is based of of both date and some other field X, num of partitions touched might be more. \r\n\r\nAlso, do check out the cardinality of your partitioning scheme. Ensure you do not have very high no of partitions (small sized), nor too less num of partitions (large sized). \r\ntry to find some middle ground. \r\n\r\nthen you also asked about timestamp characteristics of record keys right.\r\nLet me try to illustrate w/ an example.\r\nlets say, your record keys are literally timestamp field. \r\n\r\nDuring commit1, you ingest records with min and max value as t1 to t100. and this goes into data file1\r\nwith commit2, you ingest records with min and max as t101 to t201. and this goes into data file2.\r\nand ..... commit10, say you ingest with min and max as t900 to t1000... data file 10.\r\n\r\nnow, lets say you have some updates. \r\nfor record with key t55 to t65 and t305 to t310.\r\nsince each file is nicely laid out, using just the min max values, all files except file1 and file3 will be filtered out in first step in index. And then bloom filter look up happens and then actual files will be looked up to find the right location for the keys. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, lets say your record keys are random. \r\ncommit1 -> data file1: min and max values are t5 and t500\r\ncommit2 -> data file2: min and max values are t50 and t3000\r\n.\r\n.\r\ncommit10 -> data file10: min and max values are t70 and t2500.\r\n\r\nfor when we get some updates, pretty much all files will be considered for 2nd step in index. in other words, min max based pruning will not be effective and it just adds to your latency. \r\n\r\nHope this clarifies what I mean by timestamp characteristics in your record keys. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1050409991/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1050410317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4873#issuecomment-1050410317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4873","id":1050410317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-m_1N","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-25T00:54:34Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T00:54:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you list your .hoodie folder in your hudi table base path.

Do you mean to say, if you set \"hoodie.datasource.clustering.async.enable=true\" with spark datasource writes, clustering gets executed inline? or do you mean to say, clustering does not get executed only ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply, as we sync datasource clustering configure with hoodieClusterConfig by this [pr](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4828), now if we enable aync clustering by following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.option(\"hoodie.datasource.clustering.async.enable\", true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe async clustering would not be enabled, this is because: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4905/files#diff-8bda4b2174721fd642a5435282834e5d796a320c1d9e1366b27be86bd548d48aL729\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nasyncClusteringTriggerFnDefined && client.getConfig.isAsyncClusteringEnabled &&\r\n      parameters.get(ASYNC_CLUSTERING_ENABLE.key).exists(r => r.toBoolean)\r\n```\r\nuse `ASYNC_CLUSTERING_ENABLE.key` which is `hoodie.clustering.async.enabled` to check, I think this code can be removed, so we can use both `hoodie.clustering.async.enabled` and `hoodie.datasource.clustering.async.enable` to enable async clustering service.\r\n\r\nAlso, should we also sync compaction configurations same as clustering?  I found `HoodieCompactionConfig` only use `hoodie.compact.inline` to trigger sync compaction work, while `DataSourceWriteOptions` introduce `ASYNC_COMPACT_ENABLE` to enable async compaction work, I'm wonder if we should move `ASYNC_COMPACT_ENABLE` to `HoodieCompactionConfig`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1050599665/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1050600771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3312#issuecomment-1050600771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3312","id":1050600771,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-nuVD","user":{"login":"liujinhui1994","id":25769285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY5Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25769285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994","html_url":"https://github.com/liujinhui1994","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujinhui1994/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-25T07:24:07Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T07:24:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I missed this thing earlier.

> @danny0405 i see. the main problem now is the new DeleteKey breaks the serde with log block contains HoodieKey, correct? The compatibility issue is quite impactful. I noticed there is a version bit in reading the block `int version = dis.readInt()` in `getKeysToDelete()` which is not used. Now might it be make use of?\r\n> \r\n> Don't know how to do that ? Can you give some help in a following PR, appreciate that if you can help with that.\r\n\r\nOnly some rough thoughts: with the patch, starting to write the log block bytes with version = 2 and when deserialize, treat the bytes differently based on the version value got from first `readInt()`.

During compaction, we will not carry over any deleted records. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate.\r\ninsert in log block1, and delete in log block2.\r\nand then compaction kicks in.\r\nand now lets say we have a new insert for the same record w/ lower preCombine. \r\n\r\nSince compaction will not carry over any deleted records, the new record will be considered a new insert. which is in line even if compaction has not kicked in (as per master). \r\n\r\nSo, are we proposing to retain all deleted records forever in this patch or are we fixing only the case where we maintain the strict ordering only until compaction kicks in. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1052124364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1052128140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4880#issuecomment-1052128140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4880","id":1052128140,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-tjOM","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-26T13:41:09Z","updated_at":"2022-02-26T13:41:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I skimmed through the patch. \r\nLooks like, we are looking to fix only a specific scenario. \r\n\r\ninsert record with preCombine value 100.\r\ndelete record with preCombine value 50.\r\n\r\nSo, as per master, the record will be deleted. \r\nand with this patch, we will not delete the record and honor the insert as valid record. \r\n\r\nlet me know if my understanding is right.

Say, we should always obey the event time ordering of the messages and keep consistent query result no matter what the input sequence is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1053032393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1053172311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3755#issuecomment-1053172311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3755","id":1053172311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-xiJX","user":{"login":"fengjian428","id":4403474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDM0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4403474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428","html_url":"https://github.com/fengjian428","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian428/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-27T05:35:23Z","updated_at":"2022-02-27T05:35:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> #4753\r\n\r\ncould this happens when using cow table? @yihua ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1053172311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1053272675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4873#issuecomment-1053272675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4873","id":1053272675,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4-x6pj","user":{"login":"Gatsby-Lee","id":22950880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTUwODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22950880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee","html_url":"https://github.com/Gatsby-Lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gatsby-Lee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-27T07:07:36Z","updated_at":"2022-02-27T07:07:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cafelo-pfdrive \r\nI think the compaction might happen based on the compaction strategy.
