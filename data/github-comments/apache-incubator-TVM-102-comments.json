This has been discussed in more detail in [discuss forum](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/tf-lite-quantized-conv2d-operator-conversion/2651).\r\n    * First pre-computable - The core computation has some compute with kernel (Term 2 and Term 4 in the above link) that will be the part of tvm compute. This is very hard to avoid. We need a fused compute to get the best performance.\r\n    * Second pre-computable - The output scale and zero_point are used to calculate int multiplier and shifts to keep all the computations in Int domain. This computation changes for each op (e.g. concat will handle this in a different manner compared to conv). So, this computation is also kept inside quantized_conv2d op. This can be avoided by changing the API and replacing output_scale with output_multiplier and output_shift. But, this seems very specific to TFLite and one might want to handle the output_scale and output_offset in a different manner. **I am not sure about this part, so please comment.**\r\n* The op already has the requantization portion accounted for. As far as I understand, the requantization portion is just a clamp for out_dtype. (The handling of output_multiplier and output_shift, as mentioned above, is for the calculation of output quantized tensor and not for requantization).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Op dequantize\r\nDequantization is required while connecting a quantized operator and an FP32 operator. This might be a temporary stage where we do not have a quantized implementation of the second op. Dequantization might also be required at the end of the network to keep the output of the graph in FP32.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef dequantize(quantized_data, scale, zero_point, out_dtype):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Dequantize takes the scale and zero_point attributes and dequantizes the \r\n    int8/uint8 tensor to FP32 tensor.\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    -----------\r\n    quantized_data: int8/uint8 quantized input tensor\r\n           The input tensor in int8/uint8.\r\n    \r\n    scale: FP32 scalar (An attribute of the op)\r\n           The float scalar to scale the int8 values back to FP32.\r\n\r\n    zero_point: Int32 zero point (An attribute of the op)\r\n           The zero point of the distribution.\r\n\r\n    out_dtype: String\r\n           The dtype of the output. Can only be float32.\r\n\r\n    Returns\r\n    -------\r\n    data: FP32 tensor\r\n           The dequantized tensor.\r\n\r\n
