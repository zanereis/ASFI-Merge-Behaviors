couple of comments about this PR which arose from feedback that we shouldn't be using a static accessor to a singleton `Cache` instance (`CacheFactory.getAnyInstance()` for example). Here are the highlights:\r\n- Previously we had `ClusterManagementServiceFactory`s which had implementations in both `geode-management` and `geode-core`. These served as the (auto-magic) differentiators for the context that the user would call `ClusterManagementServiceProvider.getService()` in. Essentially these are replaced with `ClusterManagementServiceConfig` objects that a user has to explicitly configure and pass to `new ClientClusterManagementService(config)` to get an instance of `ClusterManagementService`. The auto-magicness is gone. The service loading shenanigans is also gone.\r\n- The `ClusterManagementServiceConfig` objects are context dependent so a user does have to be aware of which impl they should be using.\r\n- I applied a builder pattern to the creation of `ClusterManagementServiceConfig` objects. I think this is more flexible than constructors with a bunch of args (for which it isn't always clear which are required). In general, it's no problem adding an additional param to an existing builder pattern down the road. Also, builders are more flexible than setters as they are able to apply mutual exclusivity as part of API and not just at runtime.\r\n- I think having a single entry point, into our API (now `new ClientClusterManagementService(config)`) is preferable to having separate classes. Could also do something like `JavaClientClusterManagementServiceProvider.getService(host, port)` and `GeodeClusterManagementServiceProvider.getService(cache)` but I think having the config object be the differentiator makes the API more discoverable.\r\n- Lastly, retrieving the CMS on the locator is an outlier and is just `InternalLocator.getLocator().getClusterManagementService()`.\r\n- I didn't bother updating comments since this might all still change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/486246742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/486299065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3496#issuecomment-486299065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3496","id":486299065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjI5OTA2NQ==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T15:46:23Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T15:46:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I like the builder pattern here, it is better than constructors with various params.

Leaving an explanation here for posterity (also added comments which I hope clear things up for future generations):\r\nThere are two locks - one is for synchronizing between the put processing thread and the drain thread, and the other is to synchronize multiple drain threads.  The first one prevents new events from being added when the registration queue is drained.  The second one prevents multiple registration threads for the same client ID from draining the same queue.  So one synchronizes add/drain threads, and the other synchronizes multiple drain threads.  We can't use a single lock because of the optimization where we drain as many events as we can without taking out the addDrain write lock.  If we didn't do that, we could block the put processing threads for a significant amount of time if the registration queue was large.  This optimization was borrowed from the original registration queue implementation in the message dispatcher.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/488040066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/488055098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3510#issuecomment-488055098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3510","id":488055098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODA1NTA5OA==","user":{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T18:06:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T18:06:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this pr.

I know that compareTo has to ask the InetAddress for a byte array representation of the address so that it can figure out if one address is greater or lessor than the other. It was these byte array allocations that showed up in the profiler. I think this would be garbage that the collector has to deal with. The new equals logic also has fewer conditions that it needs to test for but that was not the reason for this pull request and I doubt it would be much of a difference.

It seems like throwing this exception in the middle of the write operation (after cache update but before notifying any gateways) will result in data inconsistencies or at least inconsistent deliveries of events to gateways during the time window that someone is adding a new gateway. Is that even worse than not checking at all?\r\n\r\nMy first thought was the validation should be done at the time a new member joins or when a gateway or async event queue is added or removed. But the problem with the latter is that it is not a distributed operation so the user must add or remove it to multiple members manually. We could have the current check done by the write ops wait for a while when a difference is detected in hopes that the user is working on making it consistent. I asked @boglesby to take a look at this. Perhaps we need another ticket that does NOT focus on performance but on how and when sender id consistency should be checked.

Destroying a lucene index removes an AEQ id from the region, so a put was failing in the checkSameSenderIdsAvailableOnAllNodes call in notifyGatewaySender. We ended up adding the visibleAsyncEventQueueIds set and only checking that. Lucene AEQ ids don't get added to that set.\r\n\r\nThis issue is definitely in there for normal AEQ ids, though. One saving grace is that generally customers don't add AEQs to a region on the fly. They are there from the beginning.\r\n\r\nHaving that check on every put operation seems like overkill. I think it only has to be checked when a new member joins and when a new GatewaySender or AEQ is added or removed not using gfsh.\r\n\r\nWhen a new member joins with different AEQ ids, this exception is thrown:\r\n```\r\n[error 2019/05/03 16:30:47.673 PDT <main> tid=0x1] java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot create Region /data with [ db2, db] async event ids because another cache has the same region defined with [db] async event ids\r\n\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot create Region /data with [ db2, db] async event ids because another cache has the same region defined with [db] async event ids\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.internal.cache.CreateRegionProcessor$CreateRegionMessage.handleCacheDistributionAdvisee(CreateRegionProcessor.java:466)\r\n\tat org.apache.geode.internal.cache.CreateRegionProcessor$CreateRegionMessage.process(CreateRegionProcessor.java:369)\r\n```\r\nSo, that case is already covered.\r\n\r\nCurrently when an existing member adds an AEQ id that isn't defined in another member, no exception is thrown.

@jhuynh1 ,\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing this.\r\nThe PR actually attacks both issues: it prevents the `pool` from being destroyed if it's still in use by at least one region (see [here](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3569/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.java#diff-8d7c80296713855c7f737671ad251e9aR169)) _and_ also checks wether the `pool` actually exists before trying to use it to execute the `function`, thus preventing the `NPE` altogether and throwing something more meaningful (see [here](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3569/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.java#diff-0bd9c9c821a42fe9e3ed0f32d44ba450R124)).\r\nThat said, I've changed the GEODE ticket to reflect more closely the

The `NPE`, on the other hand, doesn't let them know anything about the problem and how to prevent/overcome it.\r\n\r\n> What calls this method to unregister the pool? Shouldn't those call points be updated to not call this method if there are regions attached to the pool?\r\n\r\nWe only expect the `PoolImpl` to invoke this method during the `destroy` operation (at least within Geode code), and at this point the `PoolImpl` already checked the internal status to make sure the `Pool` can be unregistered.\r\n\r\n> The ticket references PoolManagerImpl.getPMI().unregister(PoolManager.find(\"poolOne\"));, which is not a public API. Is this the only way in which the region is being unregistered?\r\n\r\nYeah, that was an example I used to reproduce the issue I've seen. Ideally nobody should call this method as it is part of the internal API but, in case somebody does, this PR checks for the actual region count and prevents the `Pool` from being unregistered if needed.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491105692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491166560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3460#issuecomment-491166560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3460","id":491166560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTE2NjU2MA==","user":{"login":"mkevo","id":48509719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo","html_url":"https://github.com/mkevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T05:58:34Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T05:58:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any news?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491166560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491241176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3574#issuecomment-491241176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3574","id":491241176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTI0MTE3Ng==","user":{"login":"alb3rtobr","id":5363407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr","html_url":"https://github.com/alb3rtobr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T10:26:52Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T10:26:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\r\nI have seen this pull request has not triggered the execution of the ci checks.

So in another words, taking a `Cache` or `CacheMarker` is no difference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491900071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491933726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3569#issuecomment-491933726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3569","id":491933726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTkzMzcyNg==","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T18:25:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T18:25:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am still struggling to understand how, through normal API usage, we can end up in this situation?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491933726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/491957331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3569#issuecomment-491957331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3569","id":491957331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTk1NzMzMQ==","user":{"login":"mcmellawatt","id":1082688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1082688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt","html_url":"https://github.com/mcmellawatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T19:38:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T19:38:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I am still struggling to understand how, through normal API usage, we can end up in this situation?\r\n\r\nI think this is where a DUnit test could really help, because I wasn't able to see how we get into this state either.
