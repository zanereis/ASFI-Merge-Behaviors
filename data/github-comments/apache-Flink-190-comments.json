I think that would work well. We could provide a builder for the table source and forward calls to the `JDBCOutputFormatBuilder`. \r\n\r\nRegarding the query template: we can also make it an optional parameter to override the standard `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` template if set. \r\n\r\nIf you want the source to support upsert writes you might want to implement the `UpsertStreamTableSink` rather than the `AppendStreamTableSink`. The `UpsertStreamTableSink` supports append writes as well as updates and deletes by exposing the unique key fields of a `Table`.

Yes, we do have a use case where we need to disable Flink checkpointing because the time interval checkpointing model does not work with our constraints. We had to trigger Kafka commits by manually taking offset snapshot and commit after sink flushes (parallel source/sink operators are chained together), in this case, the partition offset is not incremented until the thread exits sink operator logic. Now, the only way to make the commit accurate is to expose which partition the in-flight message belongs to and we can consciously +1 to the offset at the time of snapshoting. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/310174706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/310196030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3943#issuecomment-310196030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3943","id":310196030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDE5NjAzMA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-21T20:30:23Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T20:30:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think that is a very good idea.
