I've also granted the access to the account with what\nthe token was created today - so hopefully the secret token should work\nnow.\n\nThere's also a project called \"Apache Fineract\" in Sonarcloud:\n\nhttps://sonarcloud.io/project/configuration?id=fineract\n\nI don't know who has access to this and how it had been configured. If it\nalready has the token authorized we can of course also use that.\n\nShould be pretty easy to try accessing either/both from the GitHub action\nwith the existing secret token.

two things I think would be good to address / test are:\r\n\r\n1. Backward compatibility: I don't think we want to add a new mandatory parameter to every single API signature. It would be better if the parameter was optional, and everything would work as-is if the parameter is not passed in\r\n2. Optionality: I don't think everyone wants to set up and manage a new Redis database just to support this feature.
