See TrafT4Connection.gcStmts and WeakReference objects/Queues in TrafT4Statement.java.  For the statements to be gc-ed, it is important to use a small new object heap in JVM.

Here re the findings ..\r\n------------------------------\r\nFrom: Arvind Narain \r\nSent: Tuesday, August 22, 2017 10:00 PM\r\nTo: Sandhya Sundaresan <sandhya.sundaresan@esgyn.com>; Weiqing <weiqing.xu@esgyn.cn>\r\nCc: Selva Govindarajan <selva.govindarajan@esgyn.com>; Kevin <kaihua.xu@esgyn.cn>\r\nSubject: RE: JDBC test failures on official run having to do with DDL\r\n\r\nI looked up a little bit more. With mvn since there is no order in which the tests get picked up, the success/failure depends on which test is executed before TestBlob.\r\n\r\nJdbc tests seem to utilize three different ways of setting up each test suite. \r\n\r\nOne way is to use Utils to setup the connection. Here if the schema does not exist, then it gets created.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to have BeforeClass methods that setup connection and the schema, tables needed. AfterClass goes aheads and cleans the tables and sometimes the schema – this is what happens when BatchTest is run.\r\n\r\nThird is what TestBlob is doing – using DriverManager.GetConnection to setup the connection. Here schema doesn’t get created. Hence if the expected schema has been dropped by the previous test suite (BatchTest) then the test fails since it cannot create the tables. \r\n\r\nSo yes, tests need to be looked at again so that DriverManager.GetConnection call is replaced in TestBlob*,TestClob*,TestGetIndexInfo*.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/324734279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/324841492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1214#issuecomment-324841492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1214","id":324841492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDg0MTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"Weixin-Xu","id":25025405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDI1NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25025405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu","html_url":"https://github.com/Weixin-Xu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Weixin-Xu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-25T07:09:57Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T07:09:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins
