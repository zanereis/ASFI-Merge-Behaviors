I see you are correct. My understanding was the `UncaughtExceptionHandler` would catch any `RuntimeException`s thrown by a `Thread` that is run in an `ExecutorService`. However, testing this locally using the below code indicates otherwise:\n\n```\npublic static void main(String args[]) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {\n  final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ExecutorsUtils.class);\n\n  ExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(ExecutorsUtils.newThreadFactory(Optional.of(LOG)));\n  service.submit(new Runnable() {\n    @Override public void run() {\n      LOG.info(\"Hello World!\");\n      throw new RuntimeException(\"Throwing Exception!\");\n    }\n  });\n  ExecutorsUtils.shutdownExecutorService(service, Optional.<Logger>absent());\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n0 [pool-2-thread-1] INFO gobblin.util.ExecutorsUtils  - Hello World!\n\nProcess finished with exit code 0\n```\n\nThis seems to indicate that the `UncaughtExceptionHandler` is never even invoked in the above code. Interestingly, if `ExecutorService.execute(Runnable)` is used instead of `ExecutorService.submit(Runnable)` then the `UncaughtExceptionHandler` is invoked, and the exception is logged. These stack overflow posts confirms the above findings: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3929342/choose-between-executorservices-submit-and-executorservices-execute and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1838923/why-is-uncaughtexceptionhandler-not-called-by-executorservice\n\nMy guess is that since `ExecutorService.submit(Runnable)` returns a `Future` the recommended way of handling `Exception`s is via `Future.get()`. Since `ExecutorService.execute(Runnable)` returns `void` it has to rely on the `UncaughtExceptionHandler`. I also confirmed that when invoked, the `UncaughtExceptionHandler` handles `RuntimeException`s and `Error`s properly.\n\nThis is problematic as we have followed the above pattern in many projects with the goal of handling any uncaught exceptions (ref internal JIRAs ETL-2559 and ETL-2560). For example, in Lumos we use the above pattern when running `CommitRunner`s in the `VirtualSnapshotJob`. Thats a big problem because we could have uncaught exceptions being thrown that we would never know about.\n\nThat being said, I will close this PR and create some internal JIRAs. Ideally, we would use `ExecutorService.submit(Runnable)` and use the returned `Future` object to handle any exceptions, but that is a more invasive change. The easiest fix is to just use `ExecutorService.execute(Runnable)` instead of `ExecutorService.submit(Runnable)`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/214495115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/214572047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/940#issuecomment-214572047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/940","id":214572047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDU3MjA0Nw==","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T00:31:45Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T00:31:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

yes, in fact I pretty much copied it from `KafkaWorkUnitPacker`. However, the algorithm is slightly different (the Kafka bin packer has bounded number of workunits, this algorithms bounds the total weight of each work unit), so I didn't want to change what the `KafkaWorkUnitPacker` uses.\nI can either change kafka bin packing to use this new algorithm, or implement the other algorithm as well, although for the latter, I would prefer to do that in a later PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/215207496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/215212201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/940#issuecomment-215212201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/940","id":215212201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTIxMjIwMQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T20:07:40Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T20:10:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/5959421/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/5959421)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.2%) to 44.365% when pulling **a1ec5fb92143385c89dc67a21a3267506714212f on ibuenros:distcp-hive-registration-metadata** into **e44080b2c7ccc99e5226586665fd59f626e26e13 on linkedin:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/215212201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/215217795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/943#issuecomment-215217795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/943","id":215217795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTIxNzc5NQ==","user":{"login":"lbendig","id":3898961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig","html_url":"https://github.com/lbendig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbendig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T20:28:09Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T20:28:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zliu41 can you please review this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/215217795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
