For example, a JDBC connector would invoke it if it noticed a table was added since that would require work to be redistributed among tasks. `Connector.reconfigure` is called by the framework to update the configuration; for example, if a user submitted a modified connector configuration (say, added another connection URL and credentials to start copying another database, or added a table to the whitelist of tables), then the framework would invoke this to notify the connector of changes. The default implementation just stops and restarts the connector -- you only need to override `reconfigure` if stopping and restarting is too expensive. To be honest, I'm not sure this is valuable -- we may end up wanting to remove this just to keep things simpler, especially since we can add it with the default implementation in a later version if we want to.\n\nOn the interfaces, I considered it. The class hierarchy is already a bit more complex than I'd like and I didn't actually have a use for those interfaces. Since added `implements` to a class is backwards compatible, I figured it's better to only add them once we see a use for them. The only drawback to not adding them now is that if we end up with inconsistent method signatures we won't be able to add the interfaces in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135172518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135177568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/134#issuecomment-135177568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/134","id":135177568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTE3NzU2OA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-26T21:36:28Z","updated_at":"2015-08-26T21:36:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @becketqin @hachikuji , I left some comments on the ticket regarding the names.

However, I encountered an interesting problem -- both using Strings and when I turn on schema-less mode in the JsonConverter. Both will fail the system test if it's switched to use those Converters.\n\nThe reason is offsets. The offsets use the same key and value converters as regular data. Which means with a StringConverter, they will always be converted to Strings, which is not very helpful when you try to reload them...\n\nOne obvious choice is to add separate settings for offset serializer and deserializer. That may not be that bad, I had that previously and only removed it to reduce the number of required configs. However, it is also a bit odd to have to use multiple types of converters, and with some you'll just get random errors from connectors, e.g. this one from the test I mentioned:\n\n```\norg.apache.kafka.copycat.errors.CopycatException: Unexpected offset schema.\n    at org.apache.kafka.copycat.file.FileStreamSourceTask.poll(FileStreamSourceTask.java:72)\n    at org.apache.kafka.copycat.runtime.WorkerSourceTask$WorkerSourceTaskThread.execute(WorkerSourceTask.java:292)\n    at org.apache.kafka.copycat.util.ShutdownableThread.run(ShutdownableThread.java:82)\n```\n\nThis one is caught in a sane way because I explicitly verified the schema of the offset returned by the lookup in the FileStreamSourceTask:\n\n```\n                    if (!offsetWithSchema.schema().equals(OFFSET_VALUE_SCHEMA))\n                        throw new CopycatException(\"Unexpected offset schema.\");\n                    Long lastRecordedOffset = (Long) offsetWithSchema.value();\n```\n\nBut if I hadn't you would have just gotten a ClassCastException (which is the error that left a bunch of people confused about why serialization wasn't working when they were using the default serializer incorrectly and for which we added special error handling code to clarify in the new producer).\n\nNot sure what the best solution is here. We could:\n1. Add the `offset.key.converter` and `offset.value.converter` settings and not provide defaults. Users have to understand that they need to configure all of these, but that at least provides an opportunity to point out pitfalls since they'll need to read some docs about the settings and we can add notes in the sample configs.\n2. Add the settings back and default to the `key.converter` and `value.converter` settings. This makes it easier in some cases, but error prone if they want to use non-schema-preserving converters. The user needs to understand the details of how capable different converters are or they are likely to end up with buggy configurations.\n3. Do something with annotations/extra methods on converter classes so there is a way to check whether they have the necessary support. Annotations seem cleaner, but I don't know that it's sufficient because the JsonConverter can operate in both schema and schema-less modes. However, at least in schema-less mode it is better than StringConverter at preserving types -- connectors could potentially work around the missing schemas by assuming null schemas match and then catch any exceptions caused by mismatching types.\n\nAnother related issue is that if you need to configure any of these differently and they have settings with the same name, you are currently unable to because we just pass the worker configs directly to all the converters.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135584533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/135585746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/62#issuecomment-135585746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/62","id":135585746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTU4NTc0Ng==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T23:46:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T23:46:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

to keep readers of this thread in the loop, the approach we decided on offline is to separate out the configuration, make it default to using a format that we can guarantee serializes/deserializes

The offset commit API will change a bit. The framework will handle ensuring we maintain sufficient information about the writer schema for offsets that, given a list of schemas to use for reading, we are able to properly deserialize and return the data. This requires connectors to be careful about maintaining compatibility between versions, but this isn't new -- they always would have had to support multiple offset schemas if they change the format.
