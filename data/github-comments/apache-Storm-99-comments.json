We've found that builds with heavy disk IO have suffered the most, as the legacy Linux infrastructure includes a tmpfs mount at /tmp, whereas doing the same for container-based is not straightforward and hasn't yet been implemented. Is there a chance that your project is doing a high number of disk iops?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n\n<p>How would you rate my reply?<br/>\nGreat    Okay    Not Good</p>\n\n<p>&#8211;<br/>\nDaniel Buch<br/>\nsupport@travis-ci.com</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Daniel,</p>\n\n<p>During build, we wrote stdout logs to file because of stdout length limitation of Travis CI, and it is somewhat bigger.<br/>\nI've just run test which redirects stdout to log file (monitored with OSX iostat), and it often shows over 300~500 tps while running unit tests, not compiling.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I may want to stick legacy build, and migrate to container build later.<br/>\nIt would be more appreciated when I will be noticed about news about this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nJungtaek Lim (HeartSaVioR)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Jungtaek,</p>\n\n<p>I agree that it's probably best to stick to the standard Linux infrastructure for now. We have some exciting changes in the works that may address this particular issue, which we'll likely announce via the blog (<a href=\"http://blog.travis-ci.com/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://blog.travis-ci.com/</a>) as well as Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/travisci\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://twitter.com/travisci</a>).

I believe this covers the arbitrary URL you mention. My idea with the constructor that receives the host, port, and collection is to be the default, if you will. I I am not sure /solr/ and /schema/ can be renamed on Solr. I can research that. In case they are, the option is to provide a 5 args constructor that receives these two in addition to the existing 3.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612562826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612585438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4815#issuecomment-2612585438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4815","id":2612585438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODU0Mzg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-13T17:19:18Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:54:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
