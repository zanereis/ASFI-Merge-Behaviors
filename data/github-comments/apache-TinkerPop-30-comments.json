didn't get a chance to review/vote on this before it was merged, but I dont' think this is what I expected to happen when I wrote the JIRA. I didn't think we would produce direct support for `BigDecimal` so much as coerce `BigDecimal` into double so that when Groovy did its magic to:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ng.withSack(2).V().sack(Operator.div).by(constant(3.0)).sack()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe'd just get back a double - not a `BigDecimal`. Directly supporting `BigDecimal` means we need to support it as a GraphSON type. We already do, but only in the extended module so if you wanted to use `BigDecimal` you'd have to include that configuration. No GLV at this point supports the extended module (though @davebshow is working on that). Do we really need to provide direct support for `BigDecimal` when the problem we were trying to solve was related to Groovy taking a literal and auto-assigning it to `BigDecimal` (sorta unexpected)? or do users really need the ability to do `constant(BigDecimal.valueOf(3))`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/318332636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/318357442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/682#issuecomment-318357442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/682","id":318357442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODM1NzQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T13:11:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T13:11:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IMO it makes sense to support `BigDecimal`.

java, so no significant changes there from the java one (except `in() and `from()` which are reserved keywords).\r\n- `toList()` and `next()` are used, in the same way as the rest of the GLVs, except that it causes async execution (no blocking API is provided, as it won't be usable in Node.js): `next()` returns an async iterator and `toList()` a promise that gets fulfilled with an `Array`.\r\n\r\nUsage samples: \r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst vertices = await g.V().toList();\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor await (const vertex of g.V()) {\r\n
