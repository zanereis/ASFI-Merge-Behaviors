You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1212244948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1212257594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1781#issuecomment-1212257594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1781","id":1212257594,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5IQZU6","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T17:05:59Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T17:05:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1781?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#1781](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1781?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (06f049a) into [3.5-dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/10f35d945c8c0f482b93f75e5dc39e2c4d4a9a78?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (10f35d9) will **decrease** coverage by `0.08%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff             @@\n##           3.5-dev    #1781      +/-   ##\n===========================================\n- Coverage    63.58%   63.50%   -0.09%     \n===========================================\n  Files           23       23              \n  Lines         3636     3636              \n===========================================\n- Hits          2312     2309       -3     \n- Misses        1145     1147       +2     \n- Partials       179      180       +1     \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1781?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [gremlin-go/driver/gorillaTransporter.go](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1781/diff?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation#diff-Z3JlbWxpbi1nby9kcml2ZXIvZ29yaWxsYVRyYW5zcG9ydGVyLmdv) | `64.15% <0.00%> (-2.84%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.

While unit testing, I am able to mock out any methods (like the Submit() and Close() method) as long as the function signatures for the mocked methods match the signatures of the actual methods. Where I am running into issues is when trying to mock returned data from a `ResultSet` object. I am able to create a new struct containing the result set so I can mock those methods (like the ResultSet.All() method) as well, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype MockResultSet struct {\r\n  ResultSet\r\n }\r\n \r\n func (m MockResultSet) All() ([]*Result, error) {\r\n    var res []*Result\r\n    return  res\r\n }\r\n```\r\n  \r\nHowever, since the function signatures must match, this mocked All() method must return a Result object, which I cannot assign data to as the result field is non-exported.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is helpful/ makes sense.

While unit testing, I am able to mock out any methods (like the Submit() and Close() method) as long as the function signatures for the mocked methods match the signatures of the actual methods. Where I am running into issues is when trying to mock returned data from a `ResultSet` object. I am able to create a new struct containing the result set so I can mock those methods (like the ResultSet.All() method) as well, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype MockResultSet struct {\r\n  ResultSet\r\n }\r\n \r\n func (m MockResultSet) All() ([]*Result, error) {\r\n    var res []*Result\r\n    return  res, nil\r\n }\r\n```\r\n  \r\nHowever, since the function signatures must match, this mocked All() method must return a Result object, which I cannot assign data to as the result field is non-exported.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this is helpful/ makes sense.

Changing the url to the Archive endpoint was actually my initial solution, but I was unsure how committed the service was to keeping with more modern maven versions, so I just bumped it.  \r\nI'll create a new CR with the archive CDN later today and remove it from this one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1228602374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1228746094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1795#issuecomment-1228746094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1795","id":1228746094,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5JPS1u","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-26T17:27:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T17:27:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1795?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#1795](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1795?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (fd63b04) into [3.5-dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/a150de07530d89620181252e2657f566b337971a?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (a150de0) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff            @@\n##           3.5-dev    #1795   +/-   ##\n========================================\n  Coverage    63.58%   63.58%           \n========================================\n  Files           23       23           \n  Lines         3636     3636           \n========================================\n  Hits          2312     2312           \n  Misses        1145     1145           \n  Partials       179      179           \n```\n\n\n\n:mega: We’re building smart automated test selection to slash your CI/CD build times.

First, the community has typically shied away from this feature leaving it to users to determine when the retry should occur. The last discussion I can recall on this topic took place before 3.5.x when a specific retry error code was introduced which meant that servers could specifically let the client know when retry made sense. I don't know if that would change the original thinking.  Second, in recent years we've been striving for parity among the drivers, so adding retry to python would entail a larger discussion on adding it for all the drivers.

Running just `docker/gremlin-server.sh` will launch the 3 servers as before, and one can test against them in their client app outside of maven.

I have a few questions/comments about this PR.\r\n\r\n1. It seems like the retry logic may have been missed for submit_async().\r\n2. Maybe we should consider adding exponential backoff and a maximum number of retries?\r\n3. A possible improvement might be to test if the error should be retried. E.g. don't retry for non-recoverable errors like incorrect password.\r\n4. It may make more sense to handle the connection pool logic in the client.\r\n5.

E.g. don't retry for non-recoverable errors like incorrect password.\r\n\r\nApart from non-recoverable errors, can't we also run into a situation where a traversal was already successfully evaluated on the server but sending back its results to the driver failed due to some network problem? Simply sending that traversal (which must be considered as failed by the driver as it didn't receive a successful response by the server) to the server again can be problematic if the traversal modified the graph, e.g., we shouldn't resend an `addV()` step as it results in duplicates.\r\n\r\n[This article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/configurable-retry-logic-for-microsoft-data-sqlclient/) explains some considerations that were made when a retry logic was added to Microsoft's .NET SQL client. That's also where I got the scenario from I just described with mutating traversals. They handle it by letting users configure which SQL commands should be retried / which not so that mutating commands can be skipped for the retry.\r\n\r\nI think we can add a retry logic to the drivers, but we should make it configurable for users. This means that users should be able to configure:\r\n1. Whether they want to use our retry logic in general (so they can implement their own instead / don't use a retry logic)\r\n2. Which exceptions should be retried, e.g., transient network errors, but not failures from the server or only specific failures from the server, but not a `FORBIDDEN` response for example.\r\n3. Which traversals should be retried, e.g., retry a `g.V().has()[...]` traversal, but not a mutating traversal.\r\n4. Number of retries, times to wait between retry, and so on (exponential retry with / without a random jitter could be added, but doesn't have to be, especially in the first version, in my opinion).\r\n\r\nNumber 3 is probably a lot easier to implement, then letting users specify whether they don't want to retry specific Gremlin steps or mutating traversals in general.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1239127692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1239218939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1801#issuecomment-1239218939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1801","id":1239218939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5J3Pr7","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-07T10:41:54Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T10:47:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

Is this due to complexity or because the feature is not desirable? If I were to address all these concerns, would it be likely for the PR to be merged in? Want to ensure this is a feature that the team is open to before fleshing out the implementation, if so, I'm more than happy to contribute :D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nYou both bring up great points. Agreed that the current implementation could result in unintended retries, perhaps a custom error that is raised only on retriable requests would be better?  \r\n\r\n@kenhuuu \r\n- You mentioned moving some of the logic to the client. I agree, however, my original attempts at this were trying just that. But when you get any deeper than the Driver it can get messy with async code, which I wanted to avoid.   \r\n- You mention a missed `submit_async`, you're right. If we decide to move forward with this feature I'd be more than happy to add support for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n@FlorianHockmann\r\n- Your concern about retrying mutations, this is similar to what I've fixed on some of my personal implementations, but had not implemented into this CR, as @spmallette suggested that this feature was unlikely to pick up. Definitely understand we need to use a lighter touch to our retry logic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1242576586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1243852018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1796#issuecomment-1243852018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1796","id":1243852018,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5KI6zy","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T14:45:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T14:45:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded

That wasn't to say that if it were re-proposed now under new circumstances that no one would want it. I'd also keep in mind that the last time this was discussed to my recollection was several years ago, prior to the introduction of the specific retry error code, so I was just trying to provide historical context. \r\n\r\nI think the more important take here is feature parity in the drivers - if we do it for one, it should be done for all and any PR (or series of PRs) would need to have a plan for that. The further implication then is that that sort of makes this a major feature and requires a wide community consensus. Usually a feature with this sort of scope needs more than just a PR to get that consensus - it would require a DISCUSS thread on the dev mailing list with some sort of proposal for what the design would be. We've already had some discussion here on it so summarizing all this into a post and perhaps addressing some of the points made there would be a good start.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1244253241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1244458542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1788#issuecomment-1244458542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1788","id":1244458542,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5KLO4u","user":{"login":"xiazcy","id":55853655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODUzNjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55853655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy","html_url":"https://github.com/xiazcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T20:56:37Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T20:57:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks everyone for the review!
