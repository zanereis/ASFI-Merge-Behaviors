I was struggling to get the ReplicationHttpListener to work with the HttpClient due to the async weirdness that is going on there. I even made an attempt to use the HttpListener for .NET Framework-only support, but that didn't pan out either. I ended up postponing that piece for now so I could work on the `.csproj` migration and get that out of the way.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I am considering excluding the Lucene.Net.Replicator.AspNetCore project from the CI build (and the release) until it is more complete. Would there be a point to releasing the Lucene.Net.Replicator package without it? I am just wondering whether it is required for the functionality to work or if you are providing enough of a guide to get it working without that piece.\r\n\r\nWe can always work on it more after the next beta release, I am just wondering if it should be in the release and if so how much of it?

I just have a little more to do before pushing this to master and trying out the new build process on TeamCity.

AFAIK you can use these to cross link between pages or docs during docfx's compile time linking. So we 'should' be able to use that to link to any API or page from another page without needing to know exactly where it lives ... so long as the UDI doesn't change. A class's UDI is it's fully qualified name and a page's can be defined by us. Here's the docfx docs on this type of thing \r\n* https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/links_and_cross_references.html#different-syntax-of-cross-reference \r\n* https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/metadata_dotnet_spec.html#21-unique-identifiers\r\n\r\nSo i think this should 'just work' if we use/create UDIs for documents we want to link to and code docs will already have a UDI.\r\n\r\nWe can create custom Markdown parsers for whatever syntax you choose (like I did for the `@lucene.experimental` tokens) so I think if you want to stay with the `<see>` and using a UDI reference we might be able to parse these into whatever docfx wants before it does it's linking (i guess it depends on at what stage in the compiling that is). Otherwise since we have full access to the docfx APIs when doing this custom parsing I assume I can just generate the correct link for the UDI.\r\n\r\n> Is there such a thing as a filter that can be applied to the TOC so that only the part from a single .NET assembly appears at a time\r\n\r\nNot as far as I know OOTB however, the same thing could be achieved by post processing and generating the filtered TOC yml files for each package -> namespace .

Then the user would have a way to remove the filter just by deleting the text. But don't change it on my account, as long is it is functional its all good.\r\n\r\n### Release\r\n\r\nI am getting really close to finishing up the release, and it is looking like we will be able to start the release vote as early as next week. The only thing left on the list above is to package up the the CLI utility and the API docs. There are a few failing tests I am tracking down and a few other tasks to do, but nothing very time consuming. I think the most time consuming task will be manual cleanup of the overview/package documents.\r\n\r\nIf you have a chance this weekend would be ideal to try to get this to the point where we can do our first docs release. I don't expect it to be perfect and there can be additional pull requests after this one, but lets just try to make it functional.\r\n\r\nDo note for a release, we need to add an Apache license header to every file (source, config, project, and documentation). There is a tool called [RAT](https://creadur.apache.org/rat/) that can automate that step. Take care not to do it on the test files, as we had an issue on the last release after changing some of them.\r\n\r\n### JavaDoc to Markdown Conversion Tool/Package Docs\r\n\r\nI have committed the [JavaDocToMarkdownConverter tool](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/tree/master/src/dotnet/tools/JavaDocToMarkdownConverter) and have also done a preliminary conversion (with no manual changes) so you can work out how to consume the documents. There are 244 markdown docs, but I am not sure we need the one liners. If you can't work out what to do with them, perhaps we should just setup the generator to automatically delete documents that are less than 900 bytes, which would eliminate them if they don't have any useful content.\r\n\r\nI ended up changing the names from readme.md back to overview.md and package.md because in some places they would collide due to being written to the same directory.\r\n\r\n### Namespace Links\r\n\r\nI still haven't worked out what to do about namespace links. Hopefully once you consume them with DocFx, you can work out and provide me with a better idea how to convert them - it would be nice to automate that part as much as possible before doing the manual cleanup work.\r\n\r\n### Code Links\r\n\r\nI followed the approach in the links you sent using `[link text](xref:uid)`. Let me know if that works, as I have not tested with DocFx.\r\n\r\n> There seems to be a few converters out there but not sure if they work specifically for Confluence WIKI format. I feel pretty dumb asking this but how the heck do you see the WIKI format source for this? https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/LUCENENET/Lucene.Net\r\n\r\nFor that, you would need special permissions (I think Prescott would be the one to ask about that). But the info on the WIKI is so far out of date I am not sure it is much use at this point. What specifically do you want to do with it?\r\n\r\nI tried to copy and paste it here, but apparently the text is formatted using JavaScript and when copied it just comes out plain text with no formatting - not even breaks between paragraphs.\r\n\r\n### New .csproj Format\r\n\r\nDo note I have also upgraded us to the new .csproj format (and moved some projects to a new dotnet folder). I noticed you are referencing some of these files, and I hope the new format isn't a blocker for DocFx. Basically, they no longer contain any of the file references - all files are loaded by default and they are manually excluded them when you don't want them.\r\n\r\nThe solution will also only load in Visual Studio 2017 (15.3 or higher).\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nI thought I saw a comment above about what part of the build this is going in, but I don't see it now. Basically, we will be adding this to the Lucene.Net Release task in TeamCity (https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/project.html?projectId=LuceneNet_PortableBuilds&tab=projectOverview). \r\n\r\nI think the first time out we can just do the documentation build and deployment manually, which will give me some idea how to setup the build. But one thing I do know for sure is that we will need to add a parameter to the powershell build script to pass in the Git tag that corresponds to the current build, and this value should replace `{tag}` in the repo links. Keep in mind, we may need to do this from the regular API docs as well.\r\n\r\n### .gitignore\r\n\r\nStill having an issue. You have ignored the `apidocs` folder, but there is another folder that gets generated in the root directory named `api` that is not ignored.\r\n\r\n### Lucene.Net.Cli\r\n\r\nThis should be excluded from the API docs since it is not consumable. But we will want to include the usage documentation under `src\\dotnet\\tools\\lucene-cli\\docs\\`.\r\n\r\n### Lucene.Net.ICU\r\n\r\nThis is kind of an oddball package and is probably going to be tough to do the documentation for. Basically, the code files were left in their original locations, but they are linked to and compiled into this project from several other projects. If this turns out to be too challenging to create the documentation, don't worry about it for this release - it is the most buggy part of Lucene.Net for the time being, anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/329397267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/329407262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-329407262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/206","id":329407262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTQwNzI2Mg==","user":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-14T08:09:31Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T08:09:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888 thanks for the follow up!\r\n\r\nThis weekend is an issue for me but i'll see if i can spend some time tomorrow to get us a little further. \r\n\r\nThe TOC stuff - the way that we want it - is not 'possible' OOTB with DocFx now, see: https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/issues/2041#issuecomment-328394103  So i think we should stick to the 3 level nav for now, at least for a \"v1\" of the docs\r\n\r\nI'll get back to this as soon as i can\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/329407262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/331462379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-331462379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/206","id":331462379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQ2MjM3OQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T14:27:02Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T14:27:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Shazwazza \r\n\r\nThanks again for making this happen.\r\n\r\nI have managed to get the main action items completed for the release.

I'm happy to do this if that's ok to do!\r\n\r\nIn Java, the test framework was a component that could be added to projects in order to test applications made by Lucene. However, whoever began porting the test framework wasn't concerned with making the TestFramework into a component, and I didn't realize until late in the game that this was the case. Our test framework has some limitations that are preventing it from being made into a NuGet package for general use:\r\n\r\n1. The quality of the port is sub-par\r\n2. In the .NET ecosystem, there isn't a single unit test framework that is used by the majority as there is in Java, so the test framework would need to be refactored to able to plug in to NUnit, xUnit, MSTest, and possibly other test frameworks\r\n3. The documentation is incomplete\r\n4. There are some components that were not ported because they were not required for testing Lucene.Net, but they would need to be re-evaluated to see if they are useful to others\r\n\r\nAs a result, making the TestFramework into a NuGet package that can be shipped would require quite a bit of effort.\r\n\r\nIMO, we should remove the TestFramework from the docs for now since those docs are neither complete nor useful to end users, but make it fairly easy to revert in case someone eventually makes the effort to make TestFramework into a shippable component.\r\n\r\nI see where you are going with the namespaces. However, it makes things smoother from a user perspective to be able to import a single namespace that covers both the component that is being utilized in the test and the actual test cases from the TestFramework (far fewer imports), plus that is the way it was done in Java. I am not going to argue that we must keep it this way, but being that there are several examples of namespaces that span multiple libraries in the .NET Framework itself (for example, mscorlib.dll), it seems like there should be something built into the documentation framework to make it possible to determine which assembly it is in without having to resort to naming every namespace after its assembly. Could you give it another pass to see if this is possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/393042300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/393734347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-393734347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/206","id":393734347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzczNDM0Nw==","user":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T01:49:33Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T01:49:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've just run the script to do the docs conversions and can see the output.

Since the APIs remained the same between 4.8.0 and 4.8.1, I suspect the Analysis docs haven't changed in any significant way.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, skip the test and just use 4.8.0, since that is what we are claiming this to be a port of. Ideally, we use the tool on each commit point in the future that is ported to re-generate the docs and then go back through them manually to copy/edit the code samples and custom sections that were added in the previous port.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nOne thing that will tie this together is for the Powershell command that generates the docs to accept the version number as a parameter. This will allow the documentation links to GitHub to be generated pointing to the release that we are generating so it can be fully automated. The [JavaDocToMarkdownConverter](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/tree/master/src/dotnet/tools/JavaDocToMarkdownConverter) is setup to generate the links with a `{tag}` token that represents the version number, which would be replaced when the docs are built.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would add a task to the [build script](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/a3a12967b250e8e7e5f623f0ba7572ec64f479ac/build/build.ps1) and an option to the [build.bat script](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/a3a12967b250e8e7e5f623f0ba7572ec64f479ac/build.bat) \r\n (and the [place where it is autogenerated for a release](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/a3a12967b250e8e7e5f623f0ba7572ec64f479ac/build/build.ps1#L430-L488)) for the documentation to be generated by end users that download the [latest release](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucenenet/), when a user clones the repo, or by TeamCity when each release is generated (which calls the build.ps1 script directly).\r\n\r\nWe could potentially use some automation to overwrite the main Lucene.Net website and add a new subfolder for each version of docs right from the [Lucene.Net Release](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/project.html?projectId=LuceneNet_PortableBuilds&tab=projectOverview) step.\r\n\r\nBut the point is, all of this will need a version number passed as a parameter to stay in sync (including during prerelease builds).\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nWhich leads into another point - officially, the Apache releases are these signed zip files, the NuGet packages are just for convenience. The zip files are hosted on [mirrors](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucenenet/) so the user can download from the nearest server.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to be taking on the Lucene.Net web site project as well, every Apache example I have seen includes a separate [download CGI file](https://lucenenet.apache.org/download.cgi) that includes some HTML/CSS formatting to match the rest of the site and some logic to show the nearest download location to the end user by default. I don't know for sure if there is an alternative to using a CGI script for that voodoo to happen.\r\n\r\n[Here is an email](https://apache.markmail.org/search/?q=lucenenet+%22new+website%22+order%3Adate-backward#query:lucenenet%20%22new%20website%22%20order%3Adate-backward+page:1+mid:td3gwv4u7mpxilkv+state:results) thread that had some discussion about the site, including the location of the source code of the current site.\r\n\r\nIdeally the new site will have 2 download links - one to the release on NuGet.org and the other to the mirrors with the official Apache release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/393800264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/393834720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-393834720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/206","id":393834720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzgzNDcyMA==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T10:01:16Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T10:01:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We could potentially use some automation to overwrite the main Lucene.Net website and add a new subfolder for each version of docs right from the [Lucene.Net Release](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/project.html?projectId=LuceneNet_PortableBuilds&tab=projectOverview) step.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, we wouldn't want to push them to the server at that stage.

According to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/internals/limitations#value-types-as-dictionary-keys\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft</a> this is a current issue and it isn't clear whether they intend to address it. However, according to <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/aot/#generic-valuetype-sharing\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a> it sounds like this should be currently supported. Microsoft's documentation was apparently copied from <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/archived/monotouchlimitations/\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">this page</a>, which was last updated in 2009. Then again, according to <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/aot/#limitations\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">this comment</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As of Mono 2.0, AOT compilation is only supported for non-generic methods. support for generics is currently under development.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since I can't seem to find a way to detect whether the AOT compilation is enabled and there are clear advantages (optimizations) for calling <tt>System.Collections.Generic.EqualityComparer<T>.Default</tt> on other platforms, I ended up wrapping it in a new comparer <tt>Lucene.Net.Support.EqualityComparer<T>.Default</tt>, which attempts to call <tt>System.Collections.Generic.EqualityComparer<T>.Default</tt> the first time and if there is an exception it will store a nullable boolean in a static field to indicate whether value types are supported, or null to indicate the check hasn't yet been done. After the initial attempt, it will simply call the correct comparer depending on the state of the boolean. That should fix the issue and also cover the case where it is eventually patched.</p>\n\n<p>This could be improved if there were a specific exception to catch (you didn't include it in the stack trace) to narrow down the field - right now it catches when any exception is thrown and the type is a value type, but allows all other exceptions to be thrown.</p>\n\n<p>Version <a href=\"https://www.myget.org/gallery/lucene-net-ci\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">4.8.0-ci0000001189 on the CI Feed</a> has the update - let us know if that fixes the problem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>We'd appreciate a pull request to update the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/build/build.ps1\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Powershell build script</a> so it works on Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, and UWP, and then we can set it up in TeamCity to continually test these platforms and help us track down issues (if you have the time, we should also do Mono and Xamarin.Mac). Unfortunately, I don't currently have access to all of these platforms nor the space that would be required to virtualize/emulate them in order to ensure the script works, and doing it all on the TeamCity server would be slow going.</p>\n\n<p>The test task begins <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/build/build.ps1#L248\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> - we would need an update to that and might need to update the tasks to install platforms, if required (we had to do that for dotnet core because the TeamCity servers don't necessarily have the version we need installed and end users might not, as well).</p>\n\n<p>To test, the <tt>build/build.ps1</tt> script is run with the following command from TeamCity:</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">\nImport-Module .\\build\\psake.psm1; Invoke-Psake .\\build\\build.ps1 -Task Test -properties @{frameworks_to_test=<span class=\"code-quote\">'netcoreapp2.0'</span>;backup_files=<span class=\"code-quote\">'<span class=\"code-keyword\">false</span>'</span>;prepareForBuild=<span class=\"code-quote\">'<span class=\"code-keyword\">false</span>'</span>}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>To build, pack and then test (which we use from the command line), the command looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">\nImport-Module .\\build\\psake.psm1; Invoke-Psake .\\build\\build.ps1 Default,Test -properties @{configuration=<span class=\"code-quote\">'Release'</span>} -parameters @{ packageVersion=<span class=\"code-quote\">'4.8.0-beta00006'</span>;version=<span class=\"code-quote\">'0.0.0'</span> }\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>We are using PSake as a task manager, and the documentation for it is <a href=\"http://psake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we currently only have a <tt>build.bat</tt> file to launch the command manually, which needs to be translated into a <tt>build.sh</tt> to run cross-platform. Note that TeamCity does not use this file, it is only for end users who want to build/test.

The runtime no longer raises this exception so this type is obsolete.'</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, I would suggest trying the solutions in the above answers on the 4.8.0-beta00005 build to see if you can fix this using the compilation settings, as some of the documentation and answers seem to indicate this issue has already been fixed on AOT. The fact the exception thrown is marked obsolete also seems to indicate this is not the right way to fix this issue.</p>\n\n<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> 4.8.0-beta00004 was compiled with optimizations disabled, so there is a high likelihood that it will not work with AOT. Make sure you are using 4.8.0-beta00005.</p>\n\n<p>If you are still having the issue, please put together a small standalone project with code that causes the exception to happen along with step by step instructions about how to make it occur so we can try to reproduce the issue here.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p> i think, for example there is the paragraph \"Using Delegates to call Native Functions\" in which is contained our exception.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks.

to think of it, the primary reason why LurchTable was chosen was not for thread safety, but for performance (it's all coming back to me now)....<a

We had another implementation previously that looks a lot like the one you linked to (with lots of lock statements) and we had some complaints about how it performed. I would rather try to fix it so it works with Xamarin.iOS than to replace it, if possible. </p>\n\n\n<blockquote><p>At the link <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/xamarin/ios/internals/limitations\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/xamarin/ios/internals/limitations</a> , I found the problem cause (I suppose...):</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Value types as Dictionary Keys Using a value type as a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> key is problematic, as the default Dictionary constructor attempts to use EqualityComparer<TKey>.Default. EqualityComparer<TKey>.Default, in turn, attempts to use Reflection to instantiate a new type which implements the IEqualityComparer<TKey> interface. This works for reference types (as the reflection+create a new type step is skipped), but for value types it crashes and burns rather quickly once you attempt to use it on the device. Workaround: Manually implement the IEqualityComparer<TKey> interface in a new type and provide an instance of that type to the Dictionary<TKey, TValue> (IEqualityComparer<TKey>) constructor.</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Just out of curiosity, what happens if you provide a custom EqualityComparer instead of falling back to <tt>EqualityComparer<TKey>.Default</tt>? Do note that LurchTable seems to have many hard coded references to <tt>EqualityComparer<TKey>.Default</tt>, it doesn't consistently use the passed in comparer argument everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>I tried that before, but without any way to see how/why it is failing, it is like shooting in the dark. It would be helpful if you could provide a fix that works.</p>\n\n<p>One other possibility is to wrap your value type keys inside of reference types and use those in the declaration of LurchTable. For example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-c#\">\n<span class=\"code-comment\">// This <span class=\"code-keyword\">is</span> pseudo-code - you will probably need to fix it up to compile\n</span><span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">class </span>ValueTypeRef<TKey> <span class=\"code-comment\">//<span class=\"code-keyword\">where</span> TKey: <span class=\"code-keyword\">struct</span>\n</span>{\n\t<span class=\"code-keyword\">public</span> TKey Value { <span class=\"code-keyword\">get</span>; <span class=\"code-keyword\">set</span> }\n\t\n\t<span class=\"code-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">override</span> <span class=\"code-object\"><span class=\"code-keyword\">int</span></span> GetHashCode()\n\t{\n\t    <span class=\"code-keyword\">return</span> Value?.GetHashCode();\n\t}\n\t\n\t<span class=\"code-keyword\">public</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">override</span> <span class=\"code-object\"><span class=\"code-keyword\">bool</span></span> Equals(<span class=\"code-object\">object</span> other)\n\t{\n\t    <span class=\"code-keyword\">return</span> Value?.Equals(other);\n\t}\n}\n\ncache = <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> LurchTable<ValueTypeRef<TKey>, TValue>(LurchTableOrder.Access, limit, comparer);\n\n<span class=\"code-comment\">// and change the rest of the <span class=\"code-keyword\">class </span>so it gets/sets the <span class=\"code-keyword\">value</span> from/to ValueTypeRef and only exposes the <span class=\"code-keyword\">value</span> type externally...</span>\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n\n<i>by nightowl888</i>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/624212146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/624212151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/273#issuecomment-624212151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/273","id":624212151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDIxMjE1MQ==","user":{"login":"clambertus","id":8631661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzE2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8631661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus","html_url":"https://github.com/clambertus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-08T01:53:51Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T17:57:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<p>Here is the attempt I tried to do to fix the EqualityComparers for value types, as I am sure this goes beyond fixing LurchTable if that is actually the cause: <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/commit/199fab0660b9a20508e6f1b86882441f0ec654e8\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/commit/199fab0660b9a20508e6f1b86882441f0ec654e8</a></p>\n\n<p>I have since reverted all but the LRUHashMap constructor overload, as it doesn't belong in our codebase if it doesn't have a purpose.

Note that the latter contains everything from Lucene's `analyzers-icu` from the docs, but we moved it to a new library because we didn't want the popular `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common` project to depend on the huge ICU dependencies. In Java, the features were readily built into the JDK, but they don't exist in .NET so we had to improvise. Anyway, you can now remove the footnote that it is not done. It would probably be easier to understand if we updated the names on the home page to reflect the package names, not sure how difficult that would be.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try to get the doc building functionality hooked into the release build. Maybe we won't have it automated to the point of doc site deployment, but it would be nice to at least get it to the point where running a build produces the docs and main website as [build artifacts](https://dev.azure.com/lucene-net/Lucene.NET/_build/results?buildId=5&view=results) so they can be manually downloaded and deployed.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we would parameterize the version number and base URLs that the docs use and pass them into a command to generate the docs. Those parameters would be put into `azure-pipelines.yml` where we can change them if website locations change, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have time right now, we don't necessarily have to do this before the release (the docs could be manually generated and synced up afterward). But if you have time to work on this, it would be great if we could get it partially done.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your hard work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/519378752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/519804679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-519804679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/206","id":519804679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTgwNDY3OQ==","user":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-09T07:02:08Z","updated_at":"2019-08-09T07:02:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888 Sorry ran outta time today, i have this pinned in my inbox and will get back to you on monday with hopefully some updates too.

We should probably sync them up to make it less confusing. Here is how they should be mapped:\r\n\r\n* `core` > `Lucene.Net`\r\n* `analyzers-common` > `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common` (note that the Thai analyzer functionality was moved to Lucene.Net.ICU)\r\n* `analyzers-icu` > `Lucene.Net.ICU` (Should probably order this package alphabetically instead of sticking it here)\r\n* `analyers-kuromoji` > `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Kuromoji`\r\n* `analyzers-morfologik` > Does not exist, probably never will because it is obscure and has a huge dependency\r\n* `analyzers-phonetic` > `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Phonetic`\r\n* `analyzers-smartcn` > `Lucene.Net.Analysis.SmartCn`\r\n* `analyzers-stempel` > `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Stempel`\r\n* `analyzers-uima` > `Lucene.Net.Analysis.UIMA` (Ported, but also depends on a huge library. The idea was to use IKVM to convert the dependency, which would only give .NET Framework support. Low priority, might not happen.)\r\n* `benchmark` > `Lucene.Net.Benchmark`\r\n* `classification` > `Lucene.Net.Classification`\r\n* `codecs` > `Lucene.Net.Codecs`\r\n* `demo` > Not a NuGet package. Runnable through lucene-cli, where the source code can also be viewed/exported. End users should also be made aware they can view the source directly on GitHub. It looks like some of the docs there are relevant (not the part about setting a classpath), but it might make sense to roll the \"Location of the source\", \"IndexFiles\" and \"Searching Files\" into the `lucene-cli` docs for the demos. The facet commands for `lucene-cli` should have \"location of the source\" as well.\r\n* `expressions` > `Lucene.Net.Expressions`\r\n* `facet` > `Lucene.Net.Facet`\r\n* `grouping` > `Lucene.Net.Grouping`\r\n* `highlighter` > `Lucene.Net.Highlighter` (Note that the Postings Highlighter and the `BreakIteratorBoundaryScanner` of Vector Highlighter were moved to `Lucene.Net.ICU`.)\r\n* `join` > `Lucene.Net.Join`\r\n* `memory` > `Lucene.Net.Memory`\r\n* `misc` > `Lucene.Net.Misc`\r\n* `queries` > `Lucene.Net.Queries`\r\n* `queryparser` > `Lucene.Net.QueryParser`\r\n* `replicator` > `Lucene.Net.Replicator`\r\n* `sandbox` > `Lucene.Net.Sandbox`\r\n* `spatial` > `Lucene.Net.Spatial`\r\n* `suggest` > `Lucene.Net.Suggest`\r\n* `test-framework` > (I started chipping away at this, needs lots of API work, bug fixes, doc updates, and a review to make sure it is all there. See: [LUCENENET-614](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LUCENENET/issues/LUCENENET-614). Eventually, the main packages users install will be `Lucene.Net.TestFramework.NUnit`, `Lucene.Net.TestFramework.xUnit`, and `Lucene.Net.TestFramework.MSTest`. Will probably focus on this for the next release.)\r\n\r\nWe also have `lucene-cli`, which is also a NuGet package, but contains a [dotnet tool](https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-tools/blob/master/README.md). It actually wraps functionality from\r\n\r\n1. `Lucene.Net`\r\n2. `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Kuromoji`\r\n3. `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Stempel`\r\n4. `Lucene.Net.Benchmark`\r\n5. `Lucene.Net.Demo`\r\n\r\nand makes it runnable from the command line. In Java, the commands can be run directly on the packages that contain them, `lucene-cli` was created as a way to fill the gap in functionality between Java and .NET.\r\n\r\nNote that the functionality that was wrapped into `Lucene.Net.ICU` exists in its original namespace, but in a different assembly than the original. Only the stuff that depends directly on ICU4N was moved (well, some of the classes from Postings Highlighter didn't depend on it, but they couldn't be used without the rest of the classes that had been transplanted to `Lucene.Net.ICU`, so all of them were).\r\n\r\nThe name `Lucene.Net.ICU` was chosen to be less specific than `Lucene.Net.Analysis.ICU` because it contains not just analysis functionality, but also functionality from highlighter.\r\n\r\nAs for your other questions, let me review and try massaging my memory muscles...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/520443360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/520695952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/229#issuecomment-520695952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/229","id":520695952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDY5NTk1Mg==","user":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-13T05:39:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T05:39:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888 ok great, i can certainly make the landing page listing reflect the actual package names, that's easy to do.\r\n\r\nAs for the interlinking namespaces between packages, i'll have to investigate the best way to deal with this.

You can access any version by simply changing the version number in the URL:\r\n\r\n* https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_8_0/index.html\r\n* https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_4_0/index.html\r\n\r\nThis should include beta versions. We don't want to remove documentation that might be relevant only to a specific version if someone is still depending on that version. Especially if there have been breaking API changes between them.\r\n\r\n* https://lucenenet.somewhere.com/4.8.0-beta00005/index.html\r\n* https://lucenenet.somewhere.com/4.8.0-beta00006/index.html\r\n\r\nEach version of the docs should point only to its own version of the source (using the tag)\r\n\r\n* https://lucenenet.somewhere.com/4.8.0-beta00005/index.html > https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/Lucene.Net_4_8_0_beta00005/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Ar/ArabicAnalyzer.cs\r\n* https://lucenenet.somewhere.com/4.8.0-beta00006/index.html > https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/Lucene.Net_4_8_0_beta00006/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Ar/ArabicAnalyzer.cs\r\n\r\nThis ensures the docs for a specific version stay static and point to the right code for that version even though the code is changing and new versions of docs are being released over time. We don't want to point to the head of the repository, because by the time the reader clicks the link, the doc could be years behind the code.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there should even be an index page/directory listing at the root that shows all of the versions that are available (at https://lucenenet.somewhere.com/). Also, it might make sense to make a copy (or redirect) of the latest version at https://lucenenet.somewhere.com/latest/ so we can have links that never need to drift in some places.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you are hosting them in a temporary location is fine, but they shouldn't be at the top level of the site, they should be in a directory with the version number on it (or at least one that is escaped in a way that works in the URL).\r\n\r\n### building\r\n\r\nI am having issues getting this working. \r\n\r\n1. The first obstacle I ran into was that it prompted for the credentials for the NuGet feeds I have referenced that aren't public. I *think* the appropriate way to fix this is to add a `NuGet.config` file to the appropriate folder to temporarily override what is configured on the machine. It looks like you are trying to restore both `Lucene.Net.sln` and `LuceneDocsPlugins.sln`? I was able to work around this by disabling those feeds on my machine.\r\n2. After that, it seems that `vswhere` isn't correctly identifying the location of MSBuild on my machine. I only have VS2019 Community and VS2017 Community installed. I tried downloading and installing the VS2015 build tools as per the comments, opening a new instance of Powershell and running again, but get the same result.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nWindows PowerShell\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

Can this be done using dotnet.exe?\r\n\r\n### code samples\r\n\r\nI had a thought about how we might automate the code samples more easily and reliably than a code converter, since lack of using blocks will totally make what a code converter gives us irrelevant, anyway. If the java code sample block can be isolated as a single block of text, we could generate a hash for it and put that hash into a text (markdown?) file along with the sample, for example:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n<hash>C34406A7F4070BC61B9256F6239E2B251CE691F83C2F4A6DD1ADC846FC9847A2</hash>\r\n<code language=\"java\">\r\n    Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT);\r\n\r\n    // Store the index in memory:\r\n    Directory directory = new RAMDirectory();\r\n    // To store an index on disk, use this instead:\r\n    //Directory directory = FSDirectory.open(\"/tmp/testindex\");\r\n    IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, analyzer);\r\n    IndexWriter iwriter = new IndexWriter(directory, config);\r\n    Document doc = new Document();\r\n    String text = \"This is the text to be indexed.\";\r\n    doc.add(new Field(\"fieldname\", text, TextField.TYPE_STORED));\r\n    iwriter.addDocument(doc);\r\n    iwriter.close();\r\n    \r\n    // Now search the index:\r\n    DirectoryReader ireader = DirectoryReader.open(directory);\r\n    IndexSearcher isearcher = new IndexSearcher(ireader);\r\n    // Parse a simple query that searches for \"text\":\r\n    QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, \"fieldname\", analyzer);\r\n    Query query = parser.parse(\"text\");\r\n    ScoreDoc[] hits = isearcher.search(query, null, 1000).scoreDocs;\r\n    assertEquals(1, hits.length);\r\n    // Iterate through the results:\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < hits.length; i++) {\r\n      Document hitDoc = isearcher.doc(hits[i].doc);\r\n      assertEquals(\"This is the text to be indexed.\", hitDoc.get(\"fieldname\"));\r\n    }\r\n    ireader.close();\r\n    directory.close();\r\n<code>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen these text files can be manually converted to c# and vb (the latter using the [roslyn online code converter](https://codeconverter.icsharpcode.net/)) and can be committed to the lucenenet repo. A converted file may look something like:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n<hash>C34406A7F4070BC61B9256F6239E2B251CE691F83C2F4A6DD1ADC846FC9847A2</hash>\r\n<code language=\"c#\">\r\n    Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer(LuceneVersion.LUCENE_CURRENT);\r\n\r\n    // Store the index in memory:\r\n    using (Directory directory = new RAMDirectory())\r\n    // To store an index on disk, use this instead:\r\n    //using (Directory directory = FSDirectory.Open(\"/tmp/testindex\"))\r\n    {\r\n        IndexWriterConfig config = new IndexWriterConfig(LuceneVersion.LUCENE_CURRENT, analyzer);\r\n        using (IndexWriter iwriter = new IndexWriter(directory, config))\r\n        {\r\n            Document doc = new Document();\r\n            string text = \"This is the text to be indexed.\";\r\n            doc.Add(new Field(\"fieldname\", text, TextField.TYPE_STORED));\r\n            iwriter.AddDocument(doc);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Now search the index:\r\n        using (DirectoryReader ireader = DirectoryReader.Open(directory))\r\n        {\r\n            IndexSearcher isearcher = new IndexSearcher(ireader);\r\n\r\n            // Parse a simple query that searches for \"text\":\r\n            QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(LuceneVersion.LUCENE_CURRENT, \"fieldname\", analyzer);\r\n            Query query = parser.Parse(\"text\");\r\n            ScoreDoc[] hits = isearcher.Search(query, null, 1000).ScoreDocs;\r\n            Assert.AreEqual(1, hits.Length);\r\n            // Iterate through the results:\r\n            for (int i = 0; i < hits.Length; i++)\r\n            {\r\n                Document hitDoc = isearcher.Doc(hits[i].Doc);\r\n                Assert.AreEqual(\"This is the text to be indexed.\", hitDoc.Get(\"fieldname\"));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n<code>\r\n<code language=\"vb\">\r\n    Dim analyzer As Analyzer = New StandardAnalyzer(LuceneVersion.LUCENE_CURRENT)\r\n\r\n    Using directory As Directory = New RAMDirectory()\r\n        Dim config As IndexWriterConfig = New IndexWriterConfig(LuceneVersion.LUCENE_CURRENT, analyzer)\r\n\r\n        Using iwriter As IndexWriter = New IndexWriter(directory, config)\r\n            Dim doc As Document = New Document()\r\n            Dim text As String = \"This is the text to be indexed.\"\r\n            doc.Add(New Field(\"fieldname\", text, TextField.TYPE_STORED))\r\n            iwriter.AddDocument(doc)\r\n        End Using\r\n\r\n        Using ireader As DirectoryReader = DirectoryReader.Open(directory)\r\n            Dim isearcher As IndexSearcher = New IndexSearcher(ireader)\r\n            Dim parser As QueryParser = New QueryParser(LuceneVersion.LUCENE_CURRENT, \"fieldname\", analyzer)\r\n            Dim query As Query = parser.Parse(\"text\")\r\n            Dim hits As ScoreDoc() = isearcher.Search(query, Nothing, 1000).ScoreDocs\r\n            Assert.AreEqual(1, hits.Length)\r\n\r\n            For i As Integer = 0 To hits.Length - 1\r\n                Dim hitDoc As Document = isearcher.Doc(hits(i).Doc)\r\n                Assert.AreEqual(\"This is the text to be indexed.\", hitDoc.[Get](\"fieldname\"))\r\n            Next\r\n        End Using\r\n    End Using\r\n<code>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring doc generation, the hash can be re-generated based off of the Java code and checked against this file, and if it has not changed, no change will be made and the code in the converted text file will be used in the documentation. If it has changed, then the java code block can be inserted/appended to the text file, the hash updated to the new value, and a warning/log generated so the code changes can be manually propagated to the c# and vb code blocks, then we can manually remove the java code block.\r\n\r\nWe will need to do 2 passes to generate the docs if the original Java code changes, but since that will only happen if we upgrade to target a new version of Lucene it won't be a common case. We should have the build process write warning messages to stdout and also to a log that gets uploaded as a build artifact just to ensure we don't miss this during deployment. We could do the second stage offline:\r\n\r\n1. Download the build artifacts from the automated generation.\r\n2. If we have any code changes, update the files manually and commit those files to the lucenenet official repo.\r\n3. Regenerate the docs locally based on the changes.\r\n4. Deploy.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, if there were no code changes, then we can just skip 2 & 3 and deploy.\r\n\r\nWe don't necessarily have to use `<hash>` and `<code>` elements, I am just giving that as an example. Whatever is easiest to integrate into the doc generator would be fine.\r\n\r\nOf course, it would be best if the end user had some way to switch between the VB and C# code sample in the generated documents, but for now we should focus on C# if VB is going to be too difficult or time consuming to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe original doc could then have some specially constructed token that the doc generator knows how to use to grab the code sample from the text file and insert it into the right place in the generated HTML. Some more thought will need to be put in to the exact layout and number of text files in relation to number of code samples per generated document, but I am sure you can work that out. Maybe using a GUID as both a filename and a placeholder in the documentation is the appropriate way to go, but we don't want to use the hash because that may change over time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/520831453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/521134916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/229#issuecomment-521134916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/229","id":521134916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTEzNDkxNg==","user":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T07:28:54Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T07:28:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the building we can't use dotnet because the plugin system for docfx is netframework only.

I think the term is \"YAML Front Matter\" . Each document can contain a `uid` which is how the xref links work.  For example, the benchmark doc is linked to from the docs home page using the format `[benchmark](xref:Lucene.Net.Cli.Benchmark): System for benchmarking Lucene` and the special `summary: *content` metadata is a special value for docfx to support 'overrides' which is used when clicking the \"Improve this doc\" button (but in this example overrides aren't a thing since that is only for api doc overrides, so the `summary: *content` could be removed from this md file). The reason the other CLI md docs might not have this metadata is just because we aren't currently linking to them so they don't really need a `uid`. The docs converter automatically adds uid metadata to all generted .md based on the lucene overview html files so that we can xref them.  \r\n\r\nFor the build issues on the server, i think docfx fails right away, the first logs when docfx runs is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding metadata...\r\n[19-08-15 03:47:25.597]Info:[ExtractMetadata]Environment variable VSINSTALLDIR is set to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\BuildTools, it is used as the inner compiler.\r\n[19-08-15 03:47:26.114]Info:[ExtractMetadata]Loading projects...\r\n[19-08-15 03:47:28.354]Warning:[ExtractMetadata](D:/a/1/s/src/Lucene.Net/Lucene.Net.csproj)Workspace failed with: [Failure] Msbuild failed when processing the file 'D:\\a\\1\\s\\src\\Lucene.Net\\Lucene.Net.csproj' with message: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk' specified could not be found.  D:\\a\\1\\s\\src\\Lucene.Net\\Lucene.Net.csproj\r\n```\r\n\r\nAFAIK this is because the version of docfx being used requires VS 2017 build tools installed....

I'll have to go through and fix them up prob on a case by case basis with our converter tool. In some cases it's probably just namespace imports.

The entire contents can be grabbed and inserted except for maybe the license header (I think the CLI supports exclusion tokens, but I ended up not using them). Is there some kind of placeholder we need in the doc files so you can grab the latest code from the demo (looks like the demos could use some updates to the cleaner APIs)? The demos map one-to-one to each one of the files in Lucene.Net.Demo. Would those \"blubs\" happen to look exactly like the one in the benchmark docs, and if different, could you go through and link them? Then I can go through the docs and pull out what is needed and arrange the text around the code as appropriate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/522839428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/522846437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/229#issuecomment-522846437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/229","id":522846437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjg0NjQzNw==","user":{"login":"Shazwazza","id":1742685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1742685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza","html_url":"https://github.com/Shazwazza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shazwazza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T04:19:39Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T04:19:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've pushed another update: hides UIMA and removes the `API Docs` header so we just have `Libraries` and `Tools`.\r\n\r\nSince Benchmark isn't a lib and it's part of the CLI, I was going move that under tools too?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get my head around exactly what you want but TBH I'm not quite sure :)\r\n\r\nI understand we have the CLI Demo stuff here for example: https://lucenenetdocs.azurewebsites.net/cli/demo/simple-facets.html\r\nand the demo's more or less map 1:1 with the c# demo files: https://lucenenetdocs.azurewebsites.net/api/Lucene.Net.Demo/Lucene.Net.Demo.Facet.SimpleFacetsExample.html and I get that the c# demo code is actually in source code not in displayable docs files. \r\n\r\nBased on your comments above I'm just unsure what the end result is that you are after?\r\n\r\nI don't have much more time today and then I'm overseas for 3 weeks but can see what i can do in the next hr or 2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/522846437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/522848491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/229#issuecomment-522848491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/229","id":522848491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjg0ODQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T04:31:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T04:35:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry if I am a bit scatterbrained :).\r\n\r\n> Since Benchmark isn't a lib and it's part of the CLI, I was going move that under tools too?\r\n\r\nActually, it is both a library and a tool.
