I updated the patch using your comments a few days ago.\nAnd I tested the partition location rule for hive. When adding partition on managed table or external table in hive, if the partition's directory doesn't exist, hive make the directory by force. And when dropping partition on managed table, hive will remove the directory by force, But when dropping partition on external table, hive will not remove the directory. If users want to remove the directory with drop partition statement, they need to specify PURGE option.

Presto-orc is tested and stable. And it is a bit more faster than Hive. Secondly, Hive processes ORC with row-oriented, but Presto does with column-oriented. Because ORC is columnar format, Presto's way may be more suitable. Though Tajo processes it with tuple-oriented, it can be helpful when Tajo will change to use offheap in the future.\n2.

I've reflected all your comments and added more comments to help your understanding.\nRegarding on the question about JoinGraph::addJoin, it seems that there are some misunderstandings. The JoinGraph::addJoin method just checks whether there is a cycle rather than physically cutting it. This is to maintain the `root vertexes` which the graph traverse is started from. In this patch, the root vertexes are identified if they don't have any incoming edges. However, in the presence of a cycle, every vertex has at least one incoming edge, so cannot be the root vertex. The if clause related to the cycle at JoinGraph.java:43 is to prevent such case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/121170531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/121178043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/618#issuecomment-121178043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/618","id":121178043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTE3ODA0Mw==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-14T09:23:19Z","updated_at":"2015-07-14T09:23:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In overall, the patch looks good to me.

seems that there is another problem. That is, given a partitioned table, `alter table add partition` is executed in two ways.\nHere is an example. \n\n```\ntpch> create table partitioned_nation (n_name text, n_comment text) using text partition by column (n_regionkey int8, n_nationkey int8) as select n_name, n_comment, n_regionkey, n_nationkey from nation;\ntpch> \\dfs -ls /tajo/warehouse/warehouse/tpch/partitioned_nation/n_regionkey=1\nFound 5 items\ndrwxr-xr-x   - jihoon supergroup          0 2015-07-15 00:22 /tajo/warehouse/warehouse/tpch/partitioned_nation/n_regionkey=1/n_nationkey=1\ndrwxr-xr-x   - jihoon supergroup          0 2015-07-15 00:22 /tajo/warehouse/warehouse/tpch/partitioned_nation/n_regionkey=1/n_nationkey=17\ndrwxr-xr-x   - jihoon supergroup          0 2015-07-15 00:22 /tajo/warehouse/warehouse/tpch/partitioned_nation/n_regionkey=1/n_nationkey=2\ndrwxr-xr-x   - jihoon supergroup          0 2015-07-15 00:22 /tajo/warehouse/warehouse/tpch/partitioned_nation/n_regionkey=1/n_nationkey=24\ndrwxr-xr-x   - jihoon supergroup          0 2015-07-15 00:22 /tajo/warehouse/warehouse/tpch/partitioned_nation/n_regionkey=1/n_nationkey=3\n```\n\nAs you can see in the above, the partition of (n_regionkey=1,n_nationkey=2) exists after creating the partition table.\nWhen I run the following `alter table add partition` statement, it is successfully executed. However, I think that this should be failed because there already exists a partition for the same partition key.\n\n```\ntpch> alter table partitioned_nation add partition (n_regionkey=1, n_nationkey=2) location 'hdfs://localhost:7020/tajo/warehouse/default/partitioned_nation/col1=test2/col2=3';\nOK\n```\n\nIn addition, when I run the following `alter table add partition` statement, it is failed as I expected above. But, the inconsistent execution of `alter table add partition` must be fixed.\n\n```\ntpch> alter table partitioned_nation add partition (n_regionkey=1, n_nationkey=2) location 'hdfs://localhost:7020/tajo/warehouse/default/partitioned_nation/col1=test1/col2=2';\nERROR: partition \"n_regionkey=1/n_nationkey=2 already exist in \"partitioned_nation\"\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/121286848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/121420637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/630#issuecomment-121420637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/630","id":121420637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTQyMDYzNw==","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-14T23:09:37Z","updated_at":"2015-07-14T23:09:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PartitionKey would be removed after committing TAJO-1670.
