think my only concern is that as-is we're labeling a bunch of things as \"CPU\" or \"MEMORY\" but not giving descriptions.  As a user i'd see that and thing 'well, how does this use memory'?  For instance, does that mean each flowfile's content is fully loaded in memory?  Or does it mean part of one is?  Or all of a batch of them?  Or if we say CPU usage for compression how should I think about number of threads?  Or in the case of compress content it might be worth adding 'MEMORY\" and explaining that it is actually really efficient and can handle large objects without ever loading much in memory.  So in that case the resource consideration is to alleviate concerns.  We're not qualifying the usage consideration as good or bad in this approach.  But merely \"Hey here is a resource usage consideration you should or might have in mind and here is how this component works in that regard\".  Does this make sense?  So, in that sense I'd like to see us add descriptions to all these things we're tagging.

I think it'd make sense to have a \"Toolkit\" part with a page for each element of the toolkit package. The documentation for this cli would contain the exhaustive list of the commands we can execute and maybe some common scenarios one will certainly execute (kind of cheatsheet).

Regarding the docs...\r\n\r\nLong-term I do agree that our admin guide has become quite lengthy and hard to find information, and we should probably spin-off a \"Toolkit Guide\", but I think this would be a bigger effort that could follow on later.\r\n\r\nEven if we do that though, I want to avoid having a manually maintained list of commands and there usage. It would likely always be out of date as people add new commands and have no idea there is a doc somewhere else, kind of like if you added a processor to NiFi and had to remember to manually update docs somewhere else. The interactive shell should give all the help via \"help\", \"help -v\", and \"command help\". So whatever docs we write should focus more on scenarios/tasks that can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nFor now I would say either..\r\nA) Leave the README and maybe add a little bit more information\r\nB) Move the README contents to a section in the admin guide \r\n\r\nThen later we can figure out the Toolkit Guide idea, and could consider fancy things like auto-generating docs for the CLI using annotations like processors have :)  \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367311514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367314632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2478#issuecomment-367314632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2478","id":367314632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzMxNDYzMg==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T12:45:51Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T12:45:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende @ijokarumawak +1 LGTM but it needs a second look.

I am a HUGE -1 on this change.  As @markap14 stated above, this is a critical section of code.  And while the previous version has serious flaws, they are at least somewhat know based on a long period of use.  In other words, we know there are problems, but they only bite us every so often.  \r\n\r\nThis major rewrite of a critical piece being essentially forced on users, likely without their knowledge unless they are paying close attention, seems less than ideal.  This new implementation will need SIGNIFICANT testing before it can be trusted to the same degree as the previous, even with its issues.\r\n\r\nI would have greatly preferred, and will still advocate for, making this a new implementation vs. a change to the WriteAheadFlowFileRepository (e.g. SequentialWriteAheadFlowFileRepository).  Again, there are other issues, but avoiding repo corruption in the previous WriteAheadFlowFileRepository would have been a reasonably simple fix, not requiring this rewrite.  While the rewrite may have other benefits, making it a new implementation (even if you were to make it the default...) would give users the opportunity to evaluate and decide for themselves when they are ready to move to the new repo, without forcing them to postpone an upgrade to 1.6.0 which has other worthwhile changes.\r\n\r\nI know critical sections are change all the time, and that users won't always be aware of the changes.  However, the criticality of this section combined with it's history means I think we should tread a little more lightly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367377363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367380442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2431#issuecomment-367380442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2431","id":367380442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzM4MDQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T16:16:34Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T16:16:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, ran all three reporting tasks and verified the attributes are present and correct.

Burgess clearly did testing during his code review and he had favorable findings.  Mark obviously did.  I personally spent multiple weeks in long running protracted tests on a couple of systems one of which ran uninterrupted at a rate of 120,000 events per second (so WALI update rate was far higher) for 11 days with zero full gcs, perfectly stable performance, and in testing before after with a series of hard stops/restarts all behaviors were favorable.  Do you have tests underway with problematic findings? I'll state that based on my experience with this project I am very comfortable with this change and my own personally verified observations and evaluation.\r\n\r\nIt is critical code so it does help that the author that wrote the previous implementation also authored this one and that the problems of the previous one were well stated and the path to write it was clear.  That the changes were significant in nature in terms of total lines/files impacted I dont think reflects the improved simplicity this brings and as noted it was reusing much of the core logic of the previous more complicated approach.\r\n\r\nThe claim of a simple fix being available to close the previous gaps doesn't appear to be backed with a suggested implementation though it does look like you received a good response to why that wasn't feasible.\r\n\r\nYou raised some good points and got a really detailed reply from mark a month ago after which others such as myself and Burgess stayed active on this important item.  So, in that sense this all seems fine.\r\n\r\nNow, having said all of this I do share your view that I would have preferred to see this be something users could opt-out since the old implementation even with the known potential issue has been extremely stable for a very long time and is relied upon heavily. I think using this new implementation as the default which closes the gap and which handles automatically reading old repository formatted partitions is correct and letting users that are on the old one stay on it as they wish is perfectly valid.\r\n\r\nI dont think it is right to revert this change.  But I do think it is fair to reopen the JIRA and move toward a model allowing opt-out and leveraging this as a default.  @markap14 do you agree?  @mattyb149  do you? \r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367411018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367411739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2416#issuecomment-367411739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2416","id":367411739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzQxMTczOQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T17:50:52Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T17:50:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to @joewitt 's comments on allowing opt-out or selection of the implementation.

One point on @joewitt 's comment : \"The claim of a simple fix being available to close the previous gaps doesn't appear to be backed with a suggested implementation though it does look like you received a good response to why that wasn't feasible.\" ... the reasons given were reasons why @markap14 's original proposed solution wouldn't work, not why another solution might not.  For example (as suggested previously in email):\r\n\r\n> the immediate fix that I see needing is that when building the transaction map[1], we need to keep track of the *lowest* encountered corrupt transaction. Then, when iterating over the transaction map to rebuild the repo, we need to stop when that transaction is reached...  after that we can't trust that there are no missing transactions which could lead to repo corruption or incorrect state.\r\n\r\nThis is the relatively simple fix that I believe would be more appropriate to the WhriteAheadFlowFileRepository, as it would only prevent a known bug from causing corruption, as opposed to a major rewrite.  I never got any response suggesting this wouldn't work, rather simply that another solution was preferred... which turned out not to be feasible.  At that point, instead of circling back and trying to fix the bug, it appears as though the rewrite began.\r\n\r\nIf there's a reason the author of the original implementation doesn't believe my suggestion would work to prevent the observed corruption, I'd be happy to take another look.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/0f2ac39f69c1a744f151f0d924c9978f6790b7f7/nifi-commons/nifi-write-ahead-log/src/main/java/org/wali/MinimalLockingWriteAheadLog.java#L444\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/367423003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
