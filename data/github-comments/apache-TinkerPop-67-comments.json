Should I have started from 3.5-dev in the first place?\r\n\r\nThat would be ideal, yes. I guess the easiest way now is to do a soft reset of your commit, stash it and then (hard) reset your branch on `3.5-dev`. After that, it should be easy to apply your changes from the stash and commit it again. Lastly, you can force push your branch which should let this PR end up clean with just one commit that should be merged into `3.5-dev`.\r\nIf you need help with that, just say so.\r\n\r\nOur branching strategy is that non-breaking changes, and especially bug fixes, should target the lowest release branch still supported. This is `3.5-dev` right now. We will then merge it into that branch and afterwards merge it into the other release branches (`3.6-dev` and `master`) so it ends in all upcoming releases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1383647445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1384122949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1925#issuecomment-1384122949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1925","id":1384122949,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5SgApF","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-16T14:11:44Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T14:11:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded

Just so you are aware, we are currently in the middle of a code freeze for the upcoming 3.5.5 and 3.6.2 releases, as such there likely won't be much activity on PR's for the time being and it won't be merged until after the releases are done.\r\n\r\nI'm not too familiar with the console codebase so I cannot comment with too much authority here but the changes look good to me. I would prefer if the solution did not require building and iterating through so many hash sets. I would hope there is a simple way to check if the specific module being uninstalled also needs to be deactivated without looking at all the plugins. Without looking into it further though I'm not sure if this is indeed possible without further changes. There should never be that many plugins installed at any time so I don't think it's a big issue as it is currently implemented.\r\n\r\nOne ask I have is that you base these changes off of the 3.5-dev branch instead of master. Our branch structure is that we target non breaking changes towards the earliest active development branch (currently 3.5-dev) and when a PR is merged, the changes will be pulled forward into the newer development branches as well (3.6-dev, master).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this or if I can help in any way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1402582382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1402620239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1949#issuecomment-1402620239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1949","id":1402620239,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5TmklP","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T20:41:06Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T20:41:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"These changes look good to me.

Since this is your first PR here I will explain the next steps. For a PR to be merged it needs 3 committers to give it a VOTE +1. Alternatively a PR can be merged with a single VOTE +1 after it has been open for a week. Any committer can give a VOTE -1 and block merging if they have concerns that need to be addressed.

Thanks for catching this error and submitting this fix. I would like to add that this would be further improved if a default value of 'NotAvailable' was provided as in ``` const cpuArch = process?.arch?.replace(' ', '_') || 'NotAvailable';```\r\n\r\nAlso I would like to ask if you could target this PR to 3.5-dev or 3.6-dev. Our master branch contains the code which will eventually make up the next major release (3.7.0). To have your changes brought into upcoming minor releases (3.5.6, 3.6.3) the changes will need to be in the corresponding dev branches. You should always target the earliest branch you wish to support as changes will be merged forward (eg. if your PR is merged into 3.5-dev, we will also merge it forward into 3.6-dev and master).\r\n\r\nOne wrinkle is that the 3.5.x branch is using node v10 which does not support the `?.` operator. Therefore some less elegant null checks will be needed for that branch. If you are willing to submit a node v10 compatible fix to 3.5-dev that would be fantastic. Otherwise I would ask that you add the default value of 'NotAvailable' and target this PR to 3.6-dev and I can look into a fix for the 3.5.x branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1414457774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1414483480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1952#issuecomment-1414483480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1952","id":1414483480,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5UT04Y","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-02T22:57:27Z","updated_at":"2023-02-02T22:57:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also want to note that this PR failed the JS CI tests as the linter is currently configured for ecma 2017 which is roughly equivalent to node v10.

I think it's fair to have a discussion if this is actually the ideal behaviour. Perhaps this is worthy of a discussion in the dev list? I believe if we decide a different response behaviour is preferable for bytecode traversals, that we should apply that same change to script-based traversals.

Random scripts should convert their results to one of the primitive types GraphBinary exposes. So your `toString()` of `ComputerResult` is at least one approach you could take there. It's tempting but I don't think we should get in the business of doing a quiet `toString()` by default. I feel like the user should know if a serializer isn't present directly by exception, then they alter their request accordingly.
