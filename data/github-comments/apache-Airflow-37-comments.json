Breaking the API mean going to `2.0`, is there an option there to have some sort of environment hook for monkey patching operators into `airflow.operators`. Maybe the currently hard coded data structure that does this (`airflow.operators.__init__`) goes away but can be passed in from `airflow_settings.py`, then we can get away with just an aggressive warning in the next release notes\n- individual operators depending on hooks only (as opposed to other operator) is sane, though deriving an operator is ok\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202923858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202928292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1246#issuecomment-202928292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1246","id":202928292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjkyODI5Mg==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T14:39:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T14:39:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/badge/338867/landscape.svg?style=flat)](https://landscape.io/diff/312965)\nCode quality remained the same when pulling **[f6873fe](https://github.com/jlowin/airflow/commit/f6873fe810e0dce51c78b4a6dcd0cfd880dd98de) on jlowin:docs** into **[c160bd1](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/commit/c160bd1bab0edeaedde81fbd3030e1aee3e2faac) on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202928292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202937998","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1238#issuecomment-202937998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1238","id":202937998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjkzNzk5OA==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T14:55:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T14:55:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch excellent point.

I'm putting the exact \ncode I'm running at the bottom of this message. Thanks for your patience trying to solve this. If I had a gold medal to hand out for the \"issue that identifies the most problems at once\", you'd get it!\n\nI run:\n\n```\nairflow resetdb -y\nairflow backfill test_25 -s 2016-03-25 -e 2016-03-25\nairflow backfill test_25 -s 2016-03-26 -e 2016-03-26\n```\n\nThe 3/26 backfill simply doesn't run because its dependencies haven't been met. That's the correct behavior, since `depends_on_past=True` and the previous day failed. \n\n(Something weird happens that I do need to fix but I don't think it's what you're seeing. When a task doesn't run because of dependencies, the command exits without failing. Therefore, the executor thinks it succeeded. But the task doesn't report a success, and so the executor concludes that something went wrong, puts up the \"The airflow run command failed at reporting an error message\" and, after three loops, fails the task. So you'll see the 3/26 task show up as failed with 0 try_number... that's wrong.)\n\nI've updated my branch to pull the latest fixes from master -- do you mind checking it out again?\n\nIn my dags folder:\n\n``` python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom airflow.models import DAG, Pool\nfrom airflow.operators import BashOperator, SubDagOperator\n\nimport airflow\nsession = airflow.settings.Session()\n\npool = (\n    session.query(Pool)\n    .filter(Pool.pool == 'test_pool')\n    .first())\nif not pool:\n    session.add(Pool(pool='test_pool', slots=10))\n    session.commit()\n\n\ndag_name = 'test_25'\ntest_pool = 'test_pool'\n\nstart_time = datetime(2016, 3, 25)\n\ndefault_args = {\n    'owner': 'Test',\n    'depends_on_past': True,\n    'start_date': start_time,\n    # 'email': [email_to],\n    # 'email_on_failure': True,\n    # 'email_on_retry': True,\n    # 'wait_for_downstream': False,\n}\n\n# Create the dag object\ndag = DAG(dag_name,\n          default_args=default_args,\n          schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1))\n\n\ndef get_subdag(dag, sd_id, pool=None):\n    subdag = DAG(\n        dag_id='{parent_dag}.{sd_id}'.format(\n            parent_dag=dag.dag_id,\n            sd_id=sd_id),\n        params=dag.params,\n        default_args=dag.default_args,\n        template_searchpath=dag.template_searchpath,\n        user_defined_macros=dag.user_defined_macros,\n    )\n\n    t1 = BashOperator(\n        task_id='test_task',\n        bash_command='echo \"hello\" && sleep 0.2',\n        dag=subdag,\n        pool=pool\n    )\n\n    t2 = BashOperator(\n        task_id='test_task_2_with_exit_1',\n        bash_command='echo \"hello\" && sleep 0.2 && exit 1',\n        dag=subdag,\n        pool=pool\n    )\n\n    t2.set_upstream(t1)\n\n    sdo = SubDagOperator(\n        task_id=sd_id,\n        subdag=subdag,\n        retries=0,\n        retry_delay=timedelta(seconds=0.2),\n        dag=dag,\n        depends_on_past=True,\n    )\n\n    return sdo\n\n# sd1 = get_subdag(dag, sd_id='test_subdag')\nsd2 = get_subdag(dag, sd_id='test_subdag_with_pool', pool=test_pool)\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/203153213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/203157670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1225#issuecomment-203157670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1225","id":203157670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzE1NzY3MA==","user":{"login":"syvineckruyk","id":335167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTE2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk","html_url":"https://github.com/syvineckruyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T23:30:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T23:30:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jlowin ill check it out now... thanks ! ... no need for apologies. let me know if I can do more ...
