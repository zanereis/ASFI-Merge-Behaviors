Notice that `CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES` is not an instance variable, but a **static** `HashMap`. \r\n\r\nSo in the first test execution, the `CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES` is empty, so `types` after the line `types = CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES.get(classLoader);` will be `null`, and is later initialized by `MimeTypesFactory.create()` as desired. After this, the initialized `types` is put to the static `CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES` map (https://github.com/apache/tika/blob/b068e4290ad311b1e5f1ddaa6afa40be9e7bd797/tika-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/mime/MimeTypes.java#L166). \r\n\r\nNow in the second test execution, the `CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES` already has the key of the context class loader, with corresponding `types` initialized from the previous run. So `CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES.get(classLoader)` will return such initialized object directly. In other words, `repo` **would be the same object across repeated test runs**.\r\n\r\nI think the essential idea of `CLASSLOADER_SPECIFIC_DEFAULT_TYPES` is 1-to-1 map between classloaders and default types, so this implementation does not seem buggy for me, but please confirm.
