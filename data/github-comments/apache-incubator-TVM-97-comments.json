\r\nAfter investigating generated lower stmt, I found a important difference:\r\nIn old version which has expected performance, this fused func has such a patten:\r\n```\r\ntvm_if_then_else((24512 <= ((((ax0.ax1.fused*4) + ax2) + -4) % 24528)), placeholder[(((((ax0.ax1.fused*4) + ax2) + -4) % 24528) % 16)],  ...\r\n```\r\nAfter Analyzer CanonicalSimplifier commit, it becomes:\r\n```\r\ntvm_if_then_else((24512 <= ((((ax0.ax1.fused*4) + ax2) + -466036) % 24528)), placeholder[((((((ax0.ax1.fused*4) + ax2) + -466036) % 24528) + -24512) % 16)],  ...\r\n```\r\nTwo expressions have the same semantic but the latter one is more complicated. The original one has ```-4) % 24528)``` while currently it is ```-466036) % 24528)```. Since 466036 % 24528 = 4, this is not necessary. Also note in the ```% 24528) % 16)``` becomes ```% 24528) + -24512) % 16)```. Since 24512 % 16 = 0, this is not necessary either.\r\nA lot of similar pattens happen in this func and it might be the problem. \r\n\r\nSince lowered stmt is very long, I put the complete stmt in gist: [old](https://gist.github.com/kevinthesun/7dfa5148efaecafe4f4b8bbb41e89e8e) and
