But I have the following questions regarding this RFC. I appreciate if somebody could answer them.\r\n\r\n1.  Isn't it the case that keeping the data layout in NCHWc as much as possible, and only insert layout transform when necessary, is always the best? This is what opt-level = 3 does for x86 backend. Other operators, such as max pooling, can operate directly on NCHWc layout.\r\n\r\n2. The CGO 2018 paper is based on an assumption that there is data layout transform happening between each pair of layers. I think they need to do data layout transform because they have many variant of convolution algorithms each requiring different input layouts (otherwise edge cost = 0 for all edges). But TVM x86 backend has only direct algorithm at the moment. So I don't quite understand why \r\n Graph level auto-tuning in this RFC brings such big improvements over 'TVM with default schedules'.  I think comparison between AutoTVM alone vs AutoTVM + Graph level tuning would clarify the benefit of Graph tuner.\r\n\r\nOne last point: @kevinthesun Is your mxnet built with CUDA off during cmake? Otherwise, elemwise ops are not parallelized with openmp (see [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/blob/master/mshadow/tensor_cpu-inl.h#L150) ) and MXNet results would be way worse than it should be.

I think the point of introducing graph level tuning (e.g., for data layout) is similar to the original motivation with AutoTVM. In the past many of our schedule configurations and currently our choices of data layout are only the result of handcrafted heuristics. If there is a chance that we are leaving some efficiency on the table, then I think it is worthwhile to pursue automated approaches that leave fewer stones unturned. Having flexibility when we eventually get models that break our assumptions about how model architectures and data layout transformations is another bonus.\r\n\r\n2. My understanding is that our algorithms (i.e., the best schedule configurations for each) are very shape dependent. So unless every layer has identical input/output/weight shapes, there is a chance that a different data layout will improve performance. The situation becomes even more complicated when we need to support both AVX-2 and AVX-512 CPUs, where the best choice of layout may be different depending on the vector width of the CPU.\r\n\r\nI have some some early experiments with AutoTVM optimizing NCHWc schedules under a few hand-tuned hardcoded layout configurations. The results are OK, but my understanding is that you can only get so far without considering changes to data layout. But to reiterate I think manually defining heuristics for data layout will be brittle and unmaintainable.\r\n\r\nIf we introduce support for graph level tuning, this introduces benefits beyond data layout tuning; we can begin to consider joint architecture-schedule tuning and other techniques that are starting to become popular.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419674358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419675869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1585#issuecomment-419675869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1585","id":419675869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTY3NTg2OQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-08T22:05:43Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T22:37:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eqy thanks, then I'm interested to know if there is an instance where the best NCHW schedule beats the best NCHWc schedule. My assumption is that NCHWc layout is always better for direct and winograd algorithm on x86. I care a lot about TVM performance on x86, so I'm very happy if the assumption was wrong. The difference between the best AVX2 schedule and the best AVX-512 schedule would also be interesting.\r\n\r\nI did realize that when I think of NCHWc layout, I always have one specific layout, such as NCHW8c, in mind.

The optimal inner channel dimension can be different for each layer, so it might be better to introduce data layout conversion of different inner channel dimension.

Actually the \"default\" schedule for x86 conv2d is a simple heuristic method which always choose channel factor to be 16 if possible, to minimize the number of layout transformation needed. Graph tuner is an automated way to make these decisions related to data layouts.\r\n\r\nThe data layout NCHWc is suitable for graph tuner to do such searching. However, if a certain algorithm requires different input and output data layouts, say NCHW vs NCHWc, then these data layouts can not be eliminated. In this case graph tuner wouldn't help much. Another scenario which limits graph tuner is some parameters need to be fixed to fully utilize hardware resources. This happens for intel graphics, while the output channel factor should be as close to 16 as possible to use virtual threads. I'm also trying to apply autotvm to Intel graphics, and will see how graph tuner work in this case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419681357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419682382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1585#issuecomment-419682382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1585","id":419682382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTY4MjM4Mg==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-09T00:40:47Z","updated_at":"2018-09-09T01:21:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks @kevinthesun, it makes a lot more sense now.

From my point, In place memory optimization should only care the total size of memory, instead of the element size. If there's a pooling operator can convert 2x2 int8 to 1x1 float32, I don't see any problem for allowing in place memory for it.\r\n\r\nAnd for our case, it's not just an optimization for reducing memory usage, but a mandatory requirement from a special operator. It's like for an add operator, C = A + B, our library will always place result C into operand A. I guess memory sharing optimization can't figure out whether A or B should be in placed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419762410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419769339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1696#issuecomment-419769339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1696","id":419769339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTc2OTMzOQ==","user":{"login":"zhenhuaw-me","id":4936589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzY1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4936589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenhuaw-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T02:25:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T02:25:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ZhennanQin I think @tqchen is not saying that in-place optimization is not needed, his point is (please correct me if i am going the wrong way :) @tqchen ) if you are going to optimize this scenario, a well-designed mechanism is needed - rather than some *workaround*-like thing that looks like to work (with respect)...\r\n\r\nbtw, is it supposed to be **data type** in title :)? and a personal curiosity, are you from MLT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419769339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419770560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1696#issuecomment-419770560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1696","id":419770560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTc3MDU2MA==","user":{"login":"ZhennanQin","id":39290748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjkwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39290748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhennanQin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhennanQin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T02:34:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T02:57:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackwish Thanks for pointing out the typo.

Eg, if the new cast is defined as slice+cast, which only cast first N / 4 elements to output(N is the element number), then we shouldn't do in place optimization for it because of the bug you mentioned. But if the new case is defined as pool(kernel=[2, 2], stride=2) + cast, then it could be in placed.\r\n\r\nSo SliceCast operator should do more check on data type size when register 'FInplaceOption' attribute, like\r\n```\r\n.set_attr<nnvm::FInplaceOption>(\r\n    \"FInplaceOption\", [](const NodeAttrs& attrs) {\r\n      if (CheckDtypeSize())\r\n        return std::vector<std::pair<int, int> >{{0, 0}};\r\n      else\r\n        return std::vector<std::pair<int, int> >{};\r\n    })\r\n```\r\nOverall, data type size check isn't mandatory for all in place optimization, it should be done when register 'FInplaceOption' attribute if necessary. I understand that you're worry about existing code may rely on the data type size check, I will add it for this PR to keep consistency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/420115532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/420121118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1642#issuecomment-420121118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1642","id":420121118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDEyMTExOA==","user":{"login":"hlu1","id":14827759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14827759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1","html_url":"https://github.com/hlu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hlu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T02:03:18Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T02:03:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added unit test for softmax and graph test for squeezenet_1.1. @yzhliu, @zhreshold, can any of you review?

For example, I have some experience working with Clang/LLVM and some close-source compilers. Being able to easily pretty-print an AST node from a debugger is a must for me to debug. All of those compiler frameworks provide some kind of ```dump``` AST node function that prints the node to ```std::cout``` or ```std::cerr```, e.g.,\r\n\r\n    http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Value.html#af7dca9a9e816ef69fd9e9467f64f72b4\r\n    https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Stmt.html#a99ea025ff94841762aa4fbe690c12ec9\r\n    \r\nI think adding a similar functionality would benefit other TVM developers too.

The best way to solve this issue, and if you want to run this workload fast, is to do tuning yourself on the device, as @eqy suggested. You can either tune for this workload alone or the whole network. You can refer to tutorials [here](https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/autotvm/tune_conv2d_cuda.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-autotvm-tune-conv2d-cuda-py) or [here](https://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/autotvm/tune_nnvm_cuda.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-autotvm-tune-nnvm-cuda-py) respectively. \r\n\r\nNote that there are already tuned parameters for standard imagenet models, including Resnet50. If your workload is one of them, the fallback schedule shouldn't be applied in the first place. Is your \"ResNet\" network a standard one? How many layers? (Resnet18, 50, 101 ... ?)\r\n\r\nThe HCC error you got happens during auto tuning, but it should never happen when running the final compiled model. I think we need to update schedule fallback mechanism to make unroll factor small (say 128) for rocm backend. @merrymercy  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/420447720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/420455263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1628#issuecomment-420455263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1628","id":420455263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDQ1NTI2Mw==","user":{"login":"yuruofeifei","id":3958379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3958379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei","html_url":"https://github.com/yuruofeifei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T23:03:44Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T23:03:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nishi-t Thanks for review\r\n@yzhliu I removed cuda schedule, I will send another PR for it.

However, as Intel HLS  don't support `volatile` in `ac_int` copy constructor, I've remove `volatile` keywords everywhere in the code for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/420984477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/421044653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1713#issuecomment-421044653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1713","id":421044653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTA0NDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-13T15:17:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T15:17:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reporting this.
