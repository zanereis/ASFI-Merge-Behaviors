Usually, the Jenkins configuration files are included in the project to allow contributors to modify the CI/CD configurations. To ensure the smooth operation of Ambari's CI/CD in the future, here is my plan: Could you please send me the Ambari CI/CD files to my Google email [jialiangcaimd@gmail.com](mailto:jialiangcaimd@gmail.com) ? I'll set up a local CI/CD environment to reproduce and fix the issues, and then I will need your help to update the CI/CD configuration for Ambari online. I will create a PR to include the Jenkins configuration files in the Ambari project. Also, I need your assistance to configure the Ambari CI/CD environment so that it reads the Jenkins configuration files maintained within the Ambari project.\r\n\r\n@virajjasani \r\nI have already obtained the Jenkins configuration files and set up a Jenkins environment locally. I am currently in the process of reproducing and fixing the issue.

However, \"Manage Ambari\" pages (Cluster Management, Users, Views) still seem to have this issue.\r\n\r\nI am new to open-source, so I do not know the exact procedure to report such a thing.
