Yea, I admit that this PR ended up being way too fat, but the original fat Jira-ticket tempted me to do it this way. This PR  actually fixes 8 different NPE issues in several classes reported by SonarQube and one flake test case.\r\n\r\nI will close this PR for now and split it into 5-8 separate PRs in the following days. Would you also like to have separate Jira-tickets for all PRs or would sub tasks for RATIS-952 be sufficient (naturally flake test case should have its own Jira)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/822636980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/823308421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/461#issuecomment-823308421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/461","id":823308421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMzMwODQyMQ==","user":{"login":"szetszwo","id":907380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/szetszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-20T14:13:20Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T14:13:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, please file a JIRA per PR.

If not, this warning message is thrown. In JVMMetrics, we add consoleReporter and JmxReporter before creating the MetricsRegistry. But in RatisMetrics, this is not done.\r\n\r\nThanks to explain it. Now I can reproduce the problem with Ozone Freon.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that the warning looks to emphases a real problem.\r\n\r\nIf we add reporter after creating new `metricRegistry`, all the metrics will be silently ignored (which is dangerous):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final MetricRegistriesImpl metricRegistries = new MetricRegistriesImpl();\r\n    final RatisMetricRegistry ratisMetricRegistry = metricRegistries.create(new MetricRegistryInfo(\"prefix\", \"name\", \"component\", \"desc\"));\r\n    ratisMetricRegistry.counter(\"test1\").inc();\r\n    ratisMetricRegistry.counter(\"test2\").inc();\r\n    metricRegistries.enableConsoleReporter(TimeDuration.ONE_SECOND);\r\n    Thread.sleep(10000L);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the warning is printed out, and we must have this warning as this is a real problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n11:35:22.916 [main] WARN org.apache.ratis.metrics.impl.MetricRegistriesImpl - New reporters are added after registries were created. Some metric will be missing from the reporter. Please add reporter before adding any new registry\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can fix it in Ozone side by adding the JMX reporter in freon (looks to be missing) but it also means that all the user of OzoneClient should have this line to avoid the warning:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMetricRegistries.global().enableJmxReporter();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the following alternative suggestion (please let me know what do you think).\r\n\r\nInstead of printing out warning, we can register JMX reporter by default.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public RatisMetricRegistry create(MetricRegistryInfo info) {\r\n    return registries.put(info, () -> {\r\n      if (reporterRegistrations.isEmpty()) {\r\n        enableJmxReporter();\r\n      }\r\n      RatisMetricRegistry registry = factory.create(info);\r\n      reporterRegistrations.forEach(reg -> reg.accept(registry));\r\n      return registry;\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now we have another problem. It's possible that somebody adds a reporter AFTER the first metric registry is created. In this case, the first metric registry will be missing from the second reporter:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void lateInit() throws InterruptedException {\r\n    final MetricRegistriesImpl metricRegistries = new MetricRegistriesImpl();\r\n    //implicitly adds jmx reporter\r\n    final RatisMetricRegistry ratisMetricRegistry = metricRegistries.create(new MetricRegistryInfo(\"prefix\", \"name\", \"component\", \"desc\"));\r\n    ratisMetricRegistry.counter(\"test1\").inc();\r\n    ratisMetricRegistry.counter(\"test2\").inc();\r\n   \r\n   //test1 and test2 won't be added to this reporter\r\n    metricRegistries.enableConsoleReporter(TimeDuration.ONE_SECOND);\r\n    final RatisMetricRegistry ratisMetricRegistry2 = metricRegistries.create(new MetricRegistryInfo(\"prefix2\", \"name2\", \"component2\", \"desc\"));\r\n    ratisMetricRegistry2.counter(\"test3\").inc();\r\n    Thread.sleep(10000L);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code the console reporter will print out only test3 metric test1/test2 are silently ignored.\r\n\r\nBut we can put back warning to this new place:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void addReporterRegistration(Consumer<RatisMetricRegistry> reporterRegistration,\r\n      Consumer<RatisMetricRegistry> stopReporter) {\r\n    if (registries.size() > 0) {\r\n      LOG.warn(\"New reporters are added after registries were created. Some metric will be missing from the reporter. \"\r\n          + \"Please add reporter before adding any new registry\");\r\n    }\r\n    this.reporterRegistrations.add(reporterRegistration);\r\n    this.stopReporters.add(stopReporter);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this approach we won't see the warning by default (as a default reporter will be provided) but in the rare case of an out-of-rder metric registration / reporter registration a warning can be seen....","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/862213865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/862629069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/481#issuecomment-862629069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/481","id":862629069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MjYyOTA2OQ==","user":{"login":"hanishakoneru","id":10237377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM3Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10237377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru","html_url":"https://github.com/hanishakoneru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanishakoneru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-16T18:53:47Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T18:53:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@elek thanks for the alternate approach.
