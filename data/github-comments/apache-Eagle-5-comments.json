think ApplicationProvider is just for providing a package of static application process/metadata/extensions but not for runtime.\n\nAs following typical example, for different scope of memory/mysql, `ISecurityMetadataDAO` should bind to different implementation `InMemMetadataDaoImpl`/ `JDBCSecurityMetadataDAO`, and caller just need to inject with `@Inject ISecurityMetadataDAO dao`.\n\n```\n   @Override\n    public void register(ModuleRegistry registry) {\n        registry.register(MemoryMetadataStore.class, new AbstractModule() {\n            @Override\n            protected void configure() {\n                bind(ISecurityMetadataDAO.class).to(InMemMetadataDaoImpl.class);\n            }\n        });\n\n        registry.register(MySQLMetadataStore.class, new AbstractModule() {\n            @Override\n            protected void configure() {\n                bind(ISecurityMetadataDAO.class).to(JDBCSecurityMetadataDAO.class);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n```\n\nWhile if register with current metadata store instance, then the code have to be as following, it will bind the `register` interface with `MetadataStore` and not extensible enough.\n\n```\n@Override\n    public void register(MetadataStore store, ModuleRegistry registry) {\n       if(store instance of MemoryMetadataStore){\n            registry.register(MemoryMetadataStore.class, new AbstractModule() {\n               @Override\n               protected void configure() {\n                 bind(ISecurityMetadataDAO.class).to(InMemMetadataDaoImpl.class);\n              }\n        });\n       } else if (store instance of MySQLMetadataStore){\n        registry.register(new AbstractModule() {\n            @Override\n            protected void configure() {\n                bind(ISecurityMetadataDAO.class).to(JDBCSecurityMetadataDAO.class);\n            }\n        });\n       }\n   }\n```\n\nI think both maybe ok, and have similar implementation code, but the first implementation should be more flexible, especially in future we may be able to extend more than MetadataStore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/239067623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/239070003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/eagle/pull/303#issuecomment-239070003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/303","id":239070003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA3MDAwMw==","user":{"login":"haoch","id":1282617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch","html_url":"https://github.com/haoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T04:19:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T04:19:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@r7raul1984

   public void register(ModuleRegistry registry) {\n        registry.register(MemoryMetadataStore.class, new AbstractModule() {\n            @Override\n            protected void configure() {\n                bind(ISecurityMetadataDAO.class).to(InMemMetadataDaoImpl.class);\n            }\n        });\n\n```\n    registry.register(JDBCMetadataStore.class, new AbstractModule() {\n        @Override\n        protected void configure() {\n            bind(ISecurityMetadataDAO.class).to(JDBCSecurityMetadataDAO.class);\n        }\n    });\n}\n```\n\nAgain this is too cumbersome, too much code for application and application developer need understand the framework to use.\nFurther, what if the application needs know configuration for eagle server. I still prefer to have global configuration to each application for flexibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/239300612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/239342934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/eagle/pull/331#issuecomment-239342934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/331","id":239342934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTM0MjkzNA==","user":{"login":"haoch","id":1282617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch","html_url":"https://github.com/haoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-12T01:50:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T01:54:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the implementation is to provide the foundation for make sure the code modules extensible, as how much code developer should write it's to continue simplifying the interface or DSL.\n\n> - Further, what if the application needs know configuration for eagle server\n\nWe should follow the defined interface of Application.
