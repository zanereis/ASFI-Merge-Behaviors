It seems that as of #4298, the call to `create_engine` within `create_table_from_csv` [located here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs.py#L138) is using `sqlalchemy_uri` to create a new SQLAlchemy engine. This works as expected if the URI does not contain a password - however if it does, this string contains the *masked* password (i.e. `XXXXXXXX`), and authentication is attempted using that instead. Changing the line to use `sqlalchemy_uri_decrypted` instead sends the actual password, resolving the issue. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\r\n        # File \"superset/db_engine_specs.py\", line ~134\r\n        # ...\r\n        df_to_db_kwargs = {\r\n            'table': table,\r\n            'df': df,\r\n            'name': form.name.data,\r\n            'con': create_engine(form.con.data.sqlalchemy_uri_decrypted, echo=False),\r\n            'schema': form.schema.data,\r\n            'if_exists': form.if_exists.data,\r\n            'index': form.index.data,\r\n            'index_label': form.index_label.data,\r\n            'chunksize': 10000,\r\n        }\r\n        # ...\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/370867065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/370867774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4285#issuecomment-370867774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4285","id":370867774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDg2Nzc3NA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T17:48:57Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T17:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ktravis care to open a PR please?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/370867774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/370874347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4500#issuecomment-370874347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4500","id":370874347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDg3NDM0Nw==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T18:09:39Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T18:09:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry @mistercrunch.

I found the security part is very detailed but also complex. \r\n1. How did Airbnb manage the user's authorization? Pick some people as admin and grant perm when new users come? How did the admin know every user's role? Shall I grant the Finance group datasource to a marketing employee?\r\n2. Would it be too annoying for the admin to add/delete/edit all the roles and add the roles to each users? Is there an automatic way or more efficient way?\r\n3. Does Airbnb deploy Superset to separate environment? Such as development, staging and production environment. Does the analyst try to create the slice/dashboard in development environment and when it success, do that process again in production environment? How did the analyst create same slice/dashboard in more than one environment? We can't just copy and paste since slice cannot import/export. Did they repeat the same process in different env? \r\n\r\nThere are so many questions🙈I am really appreciated if you can share your experience or advice! \r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/371009589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/371021034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4552#issuecomment-371021034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4552","id":371021034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTAyMTAzNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-07T04:42:50Z","updated_at":"2018-04-08T18:07:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4552](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/41c158edac43a8278d150f2e1add49dda2e338fa?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #4552   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   72.63%   72.63%           \n=======================================\n  Files         205      205           \n  Lines       15403    15403           \n  Branches     1183     1183           \n=======================================\n  Hits        11188    11188           \n  Misses       4212     4212           \n  Partials        3        3\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvY29uZmlnLnB5) | `92.3% <0%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4552?src=pr&el=footer).
