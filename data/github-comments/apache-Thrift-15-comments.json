So that does not hold.\n\nI looked at it again. `ProcessFunction` in thrift 0.9.3 contains the following:\n\n```\n    try {\n      result = getResult(iface, args);\n    } catch(TException tex) {\n      LOGGER.error(\"Internal error processing \" + getMethodName(), tex);\n      TApplicationException x = new TApplicationException(TApplicationException.INTERNAL_ERROR, \n        \"Internal error processing \" + getMethodName());\n      oprot.writeMessageBegin(new TMessage(getMethodName(), TMessageType.EXCEPTION, seqid));\n      x.write(oprot);\n      oprot.writeMessageEnd();\n      oprot.getTransport().flush();\n      return;\n    }\n```\n\nAs you can see when `getResult` throws it is encoded regardless of oneway. You may ask when does `getResult` throw? Looking at the generated code, for example:\n\n```\n      public getById_result getResult(I iface, getById_args args) throws org.apache.thrift.TException {\n        getById_result result = new getById_result();\n        try {\n          result.success = iface.getById(args.userId);\n        } catch (UserNotFoundException exc1) {\n          result.exc1 = exc1;\n        }\n        return result;\n      }\n```\n\nFor example it throws when it can not decode the request.\n\nIn other words, the text I put there initially does hold. However, since the problem will only occur for obscure exceptions like protocol error, decode problems, etc, or when a service throws a `TException`. I do not think it is worth it to put the text back.\n\nHere is a refinement of the text that might be used:\n\n> Unfortunately there is a bug in the Java code generated by Apache Thrift 0.9.1 up to 0.9.3 (and maybe earlier). Any thrown exception from the Thrift stack (for example a protocol error, or a decode/encode error) is still send. There is no correct way to handle this situation from the client perspective; you either wait for a response or not, you can't do both. Luckily this has been fixed _after_ Apache Thrift 0.9.3 (THRIFT-3479). As `oneway` is only used from Thrift 0.9.3 this will only be a problem if your client _and_ server use that version. More research is needed to make statements of combinations with non-java implementations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/240379269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/240382544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1036#issuecomment-240382544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1036","id":240382544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDM4MjU0NA==","user":{"login":"erikvanoosten","id":630600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten","html_url":"https://github.com/erikvanoosten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T11:15:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T11:15:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note: last commit is still work in progress.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/240382544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/240470021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1036#issuecomment-240470021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1036","id":240470021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDQ3MDAyMQ==","user":{"login":"erikvanoosten","id":630600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten","html_url":"https://github.com/erikvanoosten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikvanoosten/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T16:36:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T16:36:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All, @Jens-G, this documentation is ready for another review.

I considered that when starting out, however the differences between Swift 2 and 3 are pretty dramatic that makes shared code minimal (i.e. everything in this library is Value typed, compared to the Swift/Cocoa generator).\nConceptually, this /is/ the `Swift` generator, and the other one is technically Cocoa Swift.\nAdditionally, due to limitations with SPM, sharing code might not be the most sane option.\nOne key difference with this and the existing Swift library, this library has no intention of Objective-C interop, it is a pure Swift approach (It is usable in iOS apps, but Obj-C code won't be able to directly access generated Swift code beyond normal limitations).  Comparatively the existing Cocoa/Swift library is implemented in Objective-C, and Swift interop is the \"addon\" feature.\n\nWe could argue for moving the old Swift generator to be used like `--gen cocoa:swift` which would be more appropriate in my opinion.  Either way I'm not entirely sure how to shoehorn a separate generator into an existing generator (I didn't overly familiarize myself with the architecture of the Thrift generators themselves), which I assume would be required for either option.\n\nAs far as sharing code between them goes, the amount that is the same should be negligible, but packaging is the biggest concern.  Cocoapods isn't overly friendly with picking/choosing source files from different locations in the file heirarchy, and SPM isn't capable of pointing at sources not in `Sources` at all (hence the need for a separate repo for the time being to leverage it with SPM).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/246439166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/246455458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1084#issuecomment-246455458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1084","id":246455458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjQ1NTQ1OA==","user":{"login":"apocolipse","id":260871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse","html_url":"https://github.com/apocolipse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apocolipse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T19:02:43Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T19:03:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ChristopherRogers

Hence the generated code comes with the implicit \nassumption of being linked against the library version that matches the \nThrift compiler used. Always.\n\nSecond, creating the code from the IDL is (or should be) as simple as\n\n```\n$ thrift  -r  -gen netcore   Tutorial.thrift\n```\n\nThere is nothing complicated or complex about it, and it should not be more \ncomplex than that.\n\nHave fun,\nJensG \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/250560571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/250562649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1101#issuecomment-250562649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1101","id":250562649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDU2MjY0OQ==","user":{"login":"jfarrell","id":770483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/jfarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T19:11:07Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T19:11:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"License on this autoconf macro is GPLWithACException, we can not include it with Apache Thrift. see http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/250562649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
