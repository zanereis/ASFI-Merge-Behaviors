Okay I looked a bit more... it seems like this relies on the jar manifest. While it's definitely nice to not hard-code the version, I see some potential concerns:\n1. Someone is running spark without a jar file (e.g. our own unit tests, when we run spark locally with assemble-deps, etc).\n2. Someone has embedded spark in their own assembly jar, in which case the manifest is not going to inherit from Spark.\n\nIn case 2 I think this might silently give the wrong version, i.e. it could just learn the version from whoever built the assembly.\n\nSo it might be worth it to just keep this hard-coded for now... we have dependencies that rely on META-INF configurations (e.g. datanucleus) and it's pretty annoying.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41840032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41840133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/600#issuecomment-41840133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/600","id":41840133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODQwMTMz","user":{"login":"pierre-borckmans","id":5610359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTAzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5610359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans","html_url":"https://github.com/pierre-borckmans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierre-borckmans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-30T19:37:08Z","updated_at":"2014-04-30T19:44:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@pwendell AFAIK it's only made available in the META-INF of the fat jar.
