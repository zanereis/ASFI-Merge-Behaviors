We have a few tests in place that check for example that correct execution strategies are chosen by the optimizer. Since we manually rewrite the plan, it would be good to have tests that verify our changes, for example for cases where an operator has multiple outputs of which only one or all require range partitioning.

Up to now, I interpreted your concerns about the changing the color as \"you don't like _how_ I changed the colors\" -- now it got clear to me, that you don't like to idea of changing color at all. (I miss understood your concerns; sorry for that).\n\nFurthermore, I did start a discussion about this on the mailing list and @uce had the idea about changing the style: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/flink-dev/201510.mbox/%3C79C15FB9-EB82-433F-AC1D-2823CEF018AE%40apache.org%3E\nSome people seems to like it and I shared a like to a first draft (before I opened this PR). There was not too much feedback about the link, so I proceeded by opening PR.\n\nI take your concerns very seriously but still like the idea about changing the style of the doc page for a clearer distinction from the project web page.\n\nI guess we all agree that changing \"Overview\" to \"Documentation\" should be done. But This does not resolve the JIRA IMHO.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/154031115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/154031203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1319#issuecomment-154031203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1319","id":154031203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDAzMTIwMw==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T11:04:03Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T11:04:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does the cancel button also work for jobs which have been restarted?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/154031203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/154031559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1319#issuecomment-154031559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1319","id":154031559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDAzMTU1OQ==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T11:06:17Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T11:06:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A restarted job will get in running state, and that should allow it to be cancelled.

So my take on the issue would be to change only very small things like replacing \"Overview\" with \"Documentation\" and including a hint for the user that he can go back to the homepage. For design changes, I'd like someone to work on it who knows how to change the style in a nice way.\n\nWhat about a notice text on the front page of the documentation like \"You're viewing the documentation 1.0.

I thought we should do similar when we create the detached plan which we submit only after we have determined whether we can run the jar in detached mode. I ran some of the examples in detached mode and found it odd that it prints to stdout during the creation of the plan. The actual execution of the plan should of course be able to print to stdout.

If anyone has an idea how to handle large uploads, in the existing pipeline, please let me know. :)\nOtherwise I think replacing the `HttpObjectAggregator` with something that handles large payloads on disk might be a good idea. An example is here: https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/master/example/src/main/java/io/netty/example/http/upload/HttpUploadServerHandler.java\nIt should be able to handle everything cleanly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155064766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/155065545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1338#issuecomment-155065545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1338","id":155065545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTA2NTU0NQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-09T13:39:29Z","updated_at":"2015-11-09T13:39:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, I see.
