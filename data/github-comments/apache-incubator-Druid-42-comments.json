general idea on how it will help is -  \n- the already persisted segments are faster to query then IncrementalIndex. \n- With caching of results for persisted segments (#1943) and this change, queries

Overall I'm on board with supporting either:\n- some kind of function composition to allow composing aggregators with other functions.\n- some specialized methods for computing statistics such as variance.\n\nIf the objective in this particular case is to compute variance, I don't think it makes sense to have a general `sum(x^y)` aggregator, since we will almost always use x^2, and `x*x` will be orders of magnitude faster than using the generic power operator.\n\nI also agree, that if only care about variance, it may be worthwhile to look into different numerical techniques to avoid overflow problems, given the scale that we intend to have Druid run at.\n\nEven if we do go the route of having specialized aggregators, I would prefer if we exposed some form of function composition at the query API level, and then translate internally into special-purpose aggregations for the cases that we have optimized.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/156526667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/156529179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1965#issuecomment-156529179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1965","id":156529179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjUyOTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T19:10:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T19:10:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1

while I agree that a sketch approach specific to variance would give better results but complex types are a bit slower.\ncomposable approach here is more general and allows computing any polynomial

implement variance specific complex aggregator at some point.

For example, a longSum aggregator with a power 2 exponential specified at both ingestion and query time will result in a result of a power 4 result... ASSUMING no rollup.\n\nIf the exponential is applied at QUERY time, then for cases where the data was rolled up the results are very likely NOT going to be what the user is looking for. A simple scenario would be ingesting some double value at ingestion time (with doubleSum), and then issuing a doubleSum with an exponential in a query. In such a scenario the result would be some absurd polynomial of the original data that doesn't at all resemble what the user was actually looking for.\n\nAs such this functionality would be an advanced feature and, if possible, should be distinct from the default longSum/doubleSum at least in documentation, and (my personal preference) in nomenclature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/157108469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/157120799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1972#issuecomment-157120799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1972","id":157120799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzEyMDc5OQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T18:02:30Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T18:02:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Most boundaries in druid are \"greater than or equal\" on the lower and \"less than\" on the upper.

two primary concerns with adding exponent to the existing aggregator factories are the following\n- it creates a precent for tacking on additional functionality to the existing aggregator primitives. Let's say I want to compute a geometric mean, I would probably do a sum of log, should we then add an `ln` flag to doubleSum?\n- it does not provide a clean path to support function composition at the API level, nor a clean implementation amenable to further optimizations.\n\nHow about instead of adding an `exponent` field on the aggregator-factory, we add a `function` field that allows passing some kind of function of the column value. For now we can support only exponent, and pass this exponent to a specialized aggregator, but at least it leaves the path open to support more things down the road.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/157283831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/157291168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1974#issuecomment-157291168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1974","id":157291168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzI5MTE2OA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T07:00:38Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T07:00:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xvrl why is this `Incompatible` ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/157291168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/157294944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1965#issuecomment-157294944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1965","id":157294944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzI5NDk0NA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T07:09:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T07:09:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xvrl `function` instead of `exponent` sounds good. do you mean adding support for predefined functions or do you mean accepting javascript ?
