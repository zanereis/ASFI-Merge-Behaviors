That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.

To find out exactly why it's slower on your machine I recommend using nvprof to look at the perf summaries for both fp32 and fp16.\r\n\r\nWhat I have noted is that fp16 requires kernel launches with typically more registers used per thread than fp32.  There's a fixed number of registers per processor in your gpu, so cuda responds to this increase by decreasing the number of threads running concurrently.  This obviously lowers perf.  \r\n\r\nSo in the general case fp16 might run back little slower, but the big caveat is if you're using hardware that has special instructions to accelerate fp16 matrix mults.  Currently this means you'd need to have a V100 (as in the aws p3 instance) or a Titan V.  If you have this hardware you should see a quite dramatic increase in performance for network  layers that are supported (for example fully connected layers).  If you don't have one of those gpus you're probably better off sticking with fp32 for training unless you're memory constrained ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360312345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/360320083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8430#issuecomment-360320083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8430","id":360320083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDMyMDA4Mw==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T00:26:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T00:26:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@apache/mxnet-committers: This issue has been inactive for the past 90 days.
