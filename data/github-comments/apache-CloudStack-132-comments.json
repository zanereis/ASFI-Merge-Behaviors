The issues I have seen move this bug from a Major to a Critical -- especially in large environments where the law of large numbers greatly increases the probability of occurrence and its impact.  My primary hesitation is the need for a new system VM template.  However, I think LTS will eventually require a new system VM template to address outstanding site 2 site VPN issues.  Also, I don't see the patchviasocket script being impacted by this patch.

long time we don’t do this ;)\n\nFirst of all, your PR explanation is great. The code is very well documented and explained and with test cases (very good ones). Congratulations. I really like your work. \n\nI have some suggestions for you, though.\n\nI think that the method “enableNestedVirtualization” could return a Boolean. I see no need to transform the Boolean in a String there; It seems better to use Boolean.toString(bool) at line 376. Moreover, when reading the method “enableNestedVirtualization”, I felt like it was going to enable something on the VM, which is not the case. This looks more a “should”, “can”, “has” type of method. I mean, it is a method that checks if something has to/should/can be done; in this case, the enabling of nested virtualization. Therefore, I think names such as “canUseNestedVirtualization”, “should enableNestedVirtualization”, “hasToEnableNestedVirtualization” seem more appropriate.\n\nI also think that the code has room for improvements. First, to reduce the cyclomatic complexity, you can invert the first if, which become something like this:\n\n```\nif (globalNestedV == null || globalNestedVPerVM == null) {\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThen, the other conditional can be further improved. It is a bit complicated. Something like this would have the same result:\n\n```\nif (globalNVPVM) {\n            return (localNestedV == null && globalNV) || BooleanUtils.toBoolean(localNestedV);\n        }\n  return globalNV;\n```\n\nOn method “configNestedVirtualization”, I would just suggest using the word “configure” instead of “config”. At least for me, when I read config, I think configuration and not configure (this is a very personal opinion, so if you are ok with config, be my guest). A method, for me, means an action that is executed, so it seems a better fit the word “configure” (verb).\n\nThe method “testConfigNestedVirtualization”, I think it should check if the “VmDetailConstants.NESTED_VIRTUALIZATION_FLAG” flag (parameter) is being loaded properly from the “vmDetails”. I also suggest you using the “inOrder” to verify the calls in order. If the order of the calls changes, the behavior of the method changes too, right?\n\nAbout the method “enableNestedVirtualizationBaseTest”, I think it could be a little bit more self-explaining, such as: executeAndVerify<nameOfTheMethod>Test.\n\nAnd finally, about the others test methods, I think instead of TFT, TFN, and others at the end, I think if you were a bit more literal, and self-explaining, it would be better. For instance, the test method “testEnableNestedVirtualizationCaseTFF”, in a more detailed version, could be read as “testEnableNestedVirtualizationCaseGlobalNvTrueGlobalNvPvFalseLocalVmfalse”. I know it is a huge method name, but I think it facilitates for newcomers and also for the @nvazquez of the future ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239002056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239098909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1632#issuecomment-239098909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1632","id":239098909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA5ODkwOQ==","user":{"login":"karuturi","id":186833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi","html_url":"https://github.com/karuturi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuturi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T08:15:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T08:15:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@blueorangutan test\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239098909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239099885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1632#issuecomment-239099885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1632","id":239099885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA5OTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T08:21:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T08:21:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@karuturi @jburwell test keyword has been disabled due to infrastructural issues, I'll try to get this fixed today.

What do you think about this solution?\n\nThanks again for taking the time to review this PR\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239175487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239186221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1635#issuecomment-239186221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1635","id":239186221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTE4NjIyMQ==","user":{"login":"kiwiflyer","id":17278194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjc4MTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17278194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer","html_url":"https://github.com/kiwiflyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T14:55:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T14:55:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"References: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1632\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239186221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239220692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1542#issuecomment-239220692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1542","id":239220692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTIyMDY5Mg==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T16:50:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T16:50:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nvazquez  the code is great now.\n\nI have just a concern about that hack to change the field declared as final.\nIn my opinion, the final there does not bring benefits.

understand the need to create a test. And I agree that it deserves a test. What I meant was the following.\n\nIMHO, you could simply remove the final keyword of the variable declaration. Sometimes in the ACS code, I have seen people using some design/ways of coding without having a good and well-thought explanation for them (the use of final is one good example). For instance, variables “VmwareEnableNestedVirtualization” and “VmwareEnableNestedVirtualizationPerVM” are only used in the “VMwareGuru” class. They do not need to be either static or public. Moreover, there is no need for those variables to be final. \n\nIf those variables were protected (only), it would be much easier to write test cases.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239451440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/239476637","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1603#issuecomment-239476637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1603","id":239476637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTQ3NjYzNw==","user":{"login":"romain-dartigues","id":393859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Mzg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/393859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues","html_url":"https://github.com/romain-dartigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romain-dartigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-12T15:24:12Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T15:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done.\nLe
