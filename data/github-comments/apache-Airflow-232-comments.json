You said you didn't want to lower the boundaries, but that's sort of what happened: very long modules names starting with numbers are now allowed inside _all_ the codebase, despite this being acceptable only inside migrations.

\r\nIt seems semantics of _check_and_change_state_before_execution function is to change the task state to None if RUN_DEPS are not met (so that it can be rescheduled).

As per my understanding a task run(ti.run) can be triggered either by scheduler or through cmd line. And in _check_and_change_state_before_execution function we might not want to change the  state (if QUEUE_DEPS are not met) for tasks trigged via commandline.So it leaves their state as it is.\r\nWe have seen couple of instances where task remained stuck in queued state and is picked up by scheduler after restart.\r\nWe will debug it further and will check for alternate solutions.\r\nJust wanted to check if this understanding makes sense to you","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/500749047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/500778123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5379#issuecomment-500778123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5379","id":500778123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDc3ODEyMw==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T10:12:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T10:12:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There are some test failures that look like they _could_ be related:\r\n\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\n58) FAIL: test_email_alert_with_config (tests.models.test_taskinstance.TaskInstanceTest)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    /usr/lib/python3.5/unittest/mock.py line 1157 in patched\r\n      return func(*args, **keywargs)\r\n    tests/models/test_taskinstance.py line 942 in test_email_alert_with_config\r\n      self.assertEqual('template: test_email_alert_with_config', title)\r\n   AssertionError: 'template: test_email_alert_with_config' != 'Airflow alert: <TaskInstance: test_failur[75 chars]ed]>'\r\n   -
