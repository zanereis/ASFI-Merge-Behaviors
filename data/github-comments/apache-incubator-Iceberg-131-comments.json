Scala compiles .scala files into several Java classes depending on their usage. Singleton's and Static methods end up getting placed in a Class$.MODULE$ java class, so if we want to access the methods from a Scala `object` we need to use these weird $'s. I'm not sure if there is a way to make Scala compile it into a singleton with the same class name without $ but I just always use $.MODULE$ when I'm interoperating with Scala singletons from

I would personally just do not set a default for that config, given it is an optional config anyway.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that the PR is also getting quite messy with all the changes, I would say let's first add the `cache-enabled` as a catalog property with `true` as default, which is the default behavior today.

Could be a simple fix and might not be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps others will have more insight than I can provide.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/983250944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/983296239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3375#issuecomment-983296239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3375","id":983296239,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846m-jv","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-01T05:12:47Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T05:12:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@RussellSpitzer : So, anything else need to be done for this PR or it can be merged ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/983296239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/983306313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3062#issuecomment-983306313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3062","id":983306313,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846nBBJ","user":{"login":"danielcweeks","id":4925077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4925077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-01T05:37:55Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T05:37:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's been quite a while since I looked at this (prior to Spark 3), but at the time, spark relied entirely on Hadoop FileSystem metrics for tracking purposes.

In combination with JAX-RS annotations, everything that defines a REST endpoint would be combined at a single place and can be easier consumed/reasoned about by developers, rather than having the Swagger definitions and the endpoint implementations across multiple files.

I truly do appreciate it.\r\n\r\n> A few general comments from me:\r\n> \r\n> 1. 412 feels weird. the fact that some people may have load balancers in front and some load balancers standard config aren't clear about what 404 means isn't a great reason for a non-standard overload of a return code.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the primary load balancers I've worked with when encountering the want / desire to do this have been AWS provided. That's not meant as a dig on AWS ELBs or ALBs, but just to say that it's not a niche set of load balancers we're talking about. Amazon only advertise general 4xx and 5xx counts, but it's pretty common to have metrics from the load balancer or fronting servers (nginx, proxy layers) on specific codes out of the box and it's pretty common for people to parse specific codes from ELB logs via means that are typically outside of the normal observability stack (i.e. in-app / in-client metrics or reported events, if any).\r\n\r\nThat's not necessarily reason to not use 404, but I did want to point out that it likely affects most all of us. It's by no means a legacy issue or only a concern for a small set of tools. It could just be a misconfigured server as well. Or misconfigured DNS. A number of things can cause application metrics to be missing (including metrics from any kind of mesh network - though you're probably not in a good spot regardless then).\r\n\r\nMy other reason to avoid 404 is that it doesn't provide information about what was not present - in some cases, a namespace or a specific table might not be present from the same call and 404 for both requires additional tooling to monitor that, especially client side. Having a dedicated code for each is helpful there too. Using even specific codes in one response (409, 412, etc), can indicate more rich information and so I'm partial to that and having it documented vs a large number of 404s.\r\n\r\nBut there does seem to be pushback to this idea, so I'm willing to convert to 404 if enough people feel strongly about it. I'm going to handle that later as there's more feedback to cover, but will revert if people feel strongly.\r\n\r\n> 2. Thinking about the API from a high level perspective (as opposed to a mapping of existing java interfaces) it seems we have two entities to consider: Catalog and Table. Catalog operations are mostly related to high level concerns: namespaces, listings. properties, broad config etc and typically don't require modification of iceberg metadata (therefore don't require locking). Whereas tables require locking, modification of the filesystem/object store etc.\r\n\r\nI don't necessarily agree with the idea that Table requires locking and Catalog doesn't, only because I don' think this new catalog should necessarily prescribe how things are done either (just as the API doesn't currently fully prescribe how a catalog can achieve certain things). Though I do see where you're coming from and it's `Table`s that cause `Transaction`. So I don't completely disagree by any means.\r\n\r\nAlso, in some scenarios locking might be needed on the catalog, such as highly concurrent multi-tenant environments like Kyuubi or large Trino deploymens etc.\r\n\r\nI've avoided `Transaction` for now because of it in this PR. As well as table creation. Those can be tackled separately.\r\n\r\n> With this separation in mind (and the fact that we haven't specified in the API how to guarantee atomicity) I thought keeping the catalog api (eg `/v1/catalog`) to only deal w/ namespaces, properties etc may be a better separation. We could move the CRUD operations for tables to `/v1/table` paths and overload less the meaning of some of the operations here.\r\n> \r\n> Eg:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Post/Put/Delete/Get/Head on `v1/catalog/{namespace}` can refer to create, update properties, delete, get properties and check namespace existence\r\n> 2. Post/Put/Delete/Get/Head on `v1/table/{namespace}/{table}` can refer to create, update table, delete, get table and check table existence\r\n>    Then 2. only has to deal w the atmoic CRUD operations and we override much less.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to adding more separation on the routes, but admittedly I've moved a few of them back and forth a few times so I'll hold off momentarily and focus on cleaning up other parts (especially types) and providing more examples as well as working on the annotations for my own use in case we want to go that route. I'm actually finding it slightly more effective to just work on this document vs using the annotations, but the JSON representation of some items isn't out of the box without an additional library.\r\n\r\nRyan covered some reasons to have additional string constants in the path, which I agree with.\r\n\r\nWe'd need more routes than what you proposed still, such as removeProperties and setProperties (on a namespace or on a table, but two separate issues). And renameTable.\r\n\r\nFor now this PR mostly aims to cover `catalog` related issues and non-transaction based concerns on tables (so simple gets, list, and presently the main drop interface - RD from CRUD on tables).\r\n\r\nSorry for the long response, but thank you for your thorough review. I wanted to give people enough time to respond before working on it further given it became somewhat of a quick back and forth and then I was on vacation.\r\n\r\nThanks again @rymurr!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984286915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984297587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3596#issuecomment-984297587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3596","id":984297587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846qzBz","user":{"login":"xingbowu","id":12458911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU4OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12458911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu","html_url":"https://github.com/xingbowu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingbowu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-02T05:08:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T05:08:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test passed\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12458911/144355172-794f1ea3-33d6-4d3b-9ba6-326d8f482049.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12458911/144355054-f70b3410-b069-4d35-8540-a708f2080e48.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12458911/144361360-23890cdc-ce50-43cc-859c-72f04cc6dc36.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984297587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984388753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3642#issuecomment-984388753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3642","id":984388753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846rJSR","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-02T08:15:55Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T08:15:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this only happening with how the snapshot is resolving or is this happening with 0.12.0 as well?\r\n\r\nif it’s \r\n\r\n> Btw, nebula's dependency recommender plugin is on \"maintenance mode\".

The issue is that the tests will not work for these branches as Iceberg is not supported there.\r\n\r\nI have serious number of other tasks. I have found the issue and put the solution upstream, so if someone faces this they can fix it, but sadly I did not have time to follow up with a solution which could be released.

I think the general principle of an OpenAPI specification is to express the theoretical behavior of the APIs, without consideration of infrastructure setup. There can be so many layers of infrastructure and redirection in between your service and the client, you can never predict what error could happen in between. \r\n\r\nELB has a well-defined list of error codes, and counters for all of them, users can filter out what errors are from ELB and what are not if they really want to. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-troubleshooting.html\r\n\r\nREST APIs are resources based, here the resources are `namespsace` and `table`. 404 of `/namespaces/ns` clearly indicates namespace `ns` does not exist, I don't think there is ambiguity related to that.\r\n\r\n412 has a very specific meaning that \"the server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request header fields\", we should not overload the meaning.\r\n\r\nI would suggest looking at some well-known APIs to see how they are defining error codes, such as https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html. Although S3 is not REST but RPC, but the error code aspect is the same.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984945739/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984956455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1601#issuecomment-984956455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1601","id":984956455,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846tT4n","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-02T19:59:16Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T19:59:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3334","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/984956455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/985001673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3656#issuecomment-985001673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3656","id":985001673,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846te7J","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-02T21:07:37Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T21:07:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks

Hi @zpi1223! Thanks for the PR.\r\n> \r\n> For your own information, If this is what I think you're talking about (that `MERGE INTO` is resolved by position), this has actually been fixed in Spark 3.2.\r\n> \r\n> I have some unit tests here demonstrating that `MERGE INTO` will do by name resolution starting with Spark 3.2: #3440\r\n> \r\n> Of course, Spark 3.2 support won't be generally available until Iceberg 0.13.0 is released, but wanted to let you know.\r\n\r\nHi @kbendick , Thank you very much for your prompt reply. I personally think that these two are not conflicting.\r\n\r\nFirst，You are talking about the realization of functions, and what I want to express in this PR is to add certain warning information at the document level, so that the description information on the official website can be more complete, so as not to cause misunderstandings and affect the use in actual production.\r\n\r\nSecondly，Because we misunderstood the first time we used it, it took a certain amount of time to use it correctly at the end.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/985155185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/985155381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3648#issuecomment-985155381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3648","id":985155381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846uEc1","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-03T02:10:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-03T02:10:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merged, thanks for the work!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/985155381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
