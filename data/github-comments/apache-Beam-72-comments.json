I did this to avoid having a circular dependency between `GoogleCloudOptions` and `apiclient.py`. I feel like it makes sense to have these constants within the options - but I'll move them back if necessary.\r\n\r\nResult of transaction:\r\n* `dataflow_endpoint` - Using the same default for `options.py` and `apiclient.py`.\r\n* `job_name` - Default is 'beamapp-username-date-microseconds'. Test was added.\r\n* `staging_location` and `temp_location` - `staging_location` was the default of `temp_location`. Now it's the other way around, and the tests reflect that.\r\n* `machine_type` alias of `worker_machine_type` has been removed.\r\n* `disk_type` alias of `worker_disk_type` has been removed.\r\n* `disk_source_image` has been removed.\r\n* `no_save_main_session` - has been removed.\r\n\r\nI have left removal of `no_pipeline_type_check` for a different change because I had trouble removing it and fixing its tests. I have [filed JIRA-1106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1106) to track this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/265573943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/265574461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1536#issuecomment-265574461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1536","id":265574461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTU3NDQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T21:11:01Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T21:11:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/5628/\n--none--","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/265574461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/265581044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1538#issuecomment-265581044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1538","id":265581044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTU4MTA0NA==","user":{"login":"nssalian","id":8526007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MjYwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8526007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian","html_url":"https://github.com/nssalian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T21:37:14Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T21:40:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Looks good.

In Python I've changed it to be 'beamapp-username-date-microseconds'.\r\n* `staging_location` and `temp_location` - In Java, `tempLocation` is the default value for `stagingLocation`. In Python I've changed the behavior to be the same.\r\n* `temp_location` - In Java, there is two parameters: `gcpTempLocation`, and `tempLocation`. The difference is that `gcpTempLocation` has a validation for `'gs://'` in the path. Other runners don't use the `temp_location` parameter, so Ahmet and I feel that it's okay to not add a gcp specific one - for now at least.\r\n* `service_account_name`, `service_account_key_file` - These have been removed from the Java SDK, rather using the GCP technologies supported by the auth team in Google. I've changed to be like that in Python.\r\n* `machine_type` alias of `worker_machine_type` has been removed. In java, the option is `workerMachineType`, it has no aliases.\r\n* `disk_type` alias of `worker_disk_type` has been removed. Same as before.\r\n* `no_save_main_session` -  Is a Python specific parameter.\r\n* `disk_source_image` has been removed from the Java SDK.\r\n\r\nRefactoring changes:\r\n* `dataflow_endpoint` - The change of this option is only a bit of a code refactoring.
