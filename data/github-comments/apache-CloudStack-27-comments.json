@DaanHoogland \n\nNice you took time to have a look at those. It really helps sys admins to know what is going on with ACS. However, I would rather have them logged as WARN over INFO. Why? Because if we fall into the catch block, is because something went wrong or might probably require manual intervention. If you agree, would that be a lot of work to change them into WARN?\n\nConcerning the logs getting filled up too soon, I wouldn't really bother. From my point of view that's an admin task to have a clever rotation of logs. If ACS code base was more robust, we could afford less logs and filling up files wouldn't be a problem. But since it isn't, let's make sure the users/admins are aware about what is happening.\n\nWith respect to the InterruptedExceptions, we can log them as debug, but ignoring them completely wouldn't be nice. \n\nCheers,\nWilder  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/126200897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/126202911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/637#issuecomment-126202911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/637","id":126202911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjIwMjkxMQ==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T06:43:25Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T06:43:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@koushik-das, Ignoring interrupted exceptions means that you do not allow the user or other threads to interrupt you. To me that seems serious. I did not in any case see comment about why it was done so I rigorously added the messages.\nAs for level; On one hand you are right @wilderrodrigues , as some errors that have been ignored in the past have been problems. On the other hand, someone did think it was safe to ignore those errors. The real job is to asses all the messages on level but I regard that out of scope for this PR. Maybe some of them should be WARN or even ERROR and others merely DEBUG or TRACE. I put the tag [ignored] there so we know we must considder them for either proper handling or another level of logging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/126202911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/126204154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/637#issuecomment-126204154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/637","id":126204154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjIwNDE1NA==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T06:52:27Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T06:52:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fair enough, @DaanHoogland \n\nThanks for the exaplanation. :)\n\nLGTM :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/126204154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/126205414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/637#issuecomment-126205414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/637","id":126205414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjIwNTQxNA==","user":{"login":"kishankavala","id":11205932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjA1OTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11205932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala","html_url":"https://github.com/kishankavala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishankavala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T07:01:59Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T07:01:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DaanHoogland \nAgreed that setting appropriate log level is out of the scope for this PR.
