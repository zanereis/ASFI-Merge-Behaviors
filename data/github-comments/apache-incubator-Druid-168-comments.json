But that way may require going through specific other versions along the way, rather than directly from X to X + N. We try to limit how often we require this in practice, however, since if we pushed the limits every time we had the opportunity, it would annoy users.\r\n\r\nFor experimental features we don't make really any promise. But Kafka indexing is a special case I think, since it's in relatively wide use for an experimental feature (just like lookups) and it would be good to be considerate of users.

Changes to Kafka Indexing Service\r\n- **Decoupling of Druid segments and Kafka partitions** - Starting with this release, number of segments created by a Kafka Indexing Task is decoupled from number of Kafka partitions that the task is consuming from. Lets say if there are 10 partitions in Kafka and 2 Kafka Indexing tasks are running then each task will consume messages from 5 partitions, earlier the tasks would create 5 segments (one segment for each partition), now the task will create a single segment for each segment granular interval; all the records from consumed partitions go to a single druid segment. \r\n- **Incremental hand-off** - Kafka Indexing Task now also has the ability to do incremental hand-offs which means that all the segments created by a task will not be held up till the task duration is over. As soon as `maxRowsPerSegment` limit is hit, all the segments held up by the task at that point in time will be handed-off and new set of segments will be created for further messages. This also means that now the task can run for longer durations of time without accumulating old segments locally on Middle Manager nodes. Incremental handoff is not supported with `pauseAfterRead` feature.\r\n- **Miscellaneous bug fixes**\r\n#### Rolling upgrade\r\nSince Kafka Indexing Service was marked experimental, with this release, there are protocol changes between Kafka Supervisor and Kafka Indexing task and also some changes to metadata persisted on disk. Therefore, to support rolling upgrade, all the Middle Managers will need to be upgraded **first** before the Overlord. Note that this ordering is different from the standard order of upgrade, also note that this ordering is only specific to Kafka Indexing Service. If one is not using Kafka Indexing Service or can handle down time for Kafka Supervisor then one can upgrade in any order.\r\n\r\nUntil the point in time Overlord is upgraded, all the Kafka Indexing Task will behave in same manner (even if they are upgraded) as earlier which means no decoupling and incremental hand-offs. Once, Overlord is upgraded, the new tasks started by the upgraded Overlord will support the new features.\r\n\r\n#### Roll back\r\nDepending on how roll-back is done, in worst case, current set of tasks will fail. Once, both Overlord and Middle Managers are upgraded, new set of tasks should be started by Supervisor which would continue to work. Better to roll back Overlord first and then Middle Managers. Note of caution - Rolling back is not tested.\r\n  \r\n
