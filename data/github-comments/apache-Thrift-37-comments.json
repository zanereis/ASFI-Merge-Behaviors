But how could autotools use the header that is cmake-generated? I see these options:\r\n1. Generate the same header also from autotools. This would be possible but I'm not an expert how to do this.\r\n2. Make the shared library build only available with cmake, and provide a dummy header for autotools that defines the `THRIFT_EXPORT` defines as empty dummies. CMake can place the generated header higher in the search path than the dummy header to be sure the correct one is used.\r\n3. Pre-generate the header twice, once for shared and once for static library build, and store both headers in the source repository as verbatim copies. Then pick the matching header at configure time.\r\n\r\nI'm not very fond of either of these choices. If anything then number (2) seems the most feasible and least invasive. But it brings quite some confusion about the duplicate header, and its possible that people will ask for shared library builds from autotools too.\r\n\r\nWhat do yo
