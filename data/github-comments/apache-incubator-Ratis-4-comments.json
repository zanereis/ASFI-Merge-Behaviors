You are right, I did not implement it in this PR because I want to make this PR simpler to review, and I will implement it after this PR.

Could you give me a pointer?\r\n\r\n@szetszwo You are right, it does not exist in the paper. I implement it to adapt current ratis implementation. Because in current ratis, when leader election, leader will send shutdown to follower if follower, such as follower1, is not in leader's conf at [shouldSendShutdown(candidateId, candidateLastEntry)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ratis/blob/master/ratis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/server/impl/RaftServerImpl.java#L860).  So I have two choice to make follower1 shutdown: 1.pass the pre-vote in this case, so that follower1 can shutdown in real leader election; 2.pre-vote in charge of shutdown follower1, but this will make pre-vote complicated. So I choose the first option.

Currently in Ozone, the maximum number of cached segments is set to 2 in both Datanodes and Ozone. \r\n\r\n1. Instead of purging logs when they need to be evicted from cache, can the purge implementation be fixed to also consider the logs  on disk and not in cache. With this approach, we would have  to take care of tracking on disk logs for other cases as well (for example {{RaftLog#getStartIndex}}).\r\n2. Another option would be to align the cache eviction logic with the log purge logic but this might not be optimal if the purge limit is set very high. \r\n\r\nI think the first approach would be the clean solution.

Currently in Ozone, the maximum number of cached segments is set to 2 in both Datanodes and Ozone.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI think you are referring to the change in TestSegmentedRaftLog#syncWithSnapshot. So this function is called in follower after install snapshot or notify install snapshot. Since the snapshot has already been installed in the follower I think it is ok to purge the logs. Leader would have the snapshot too. \r\nCurrently purge is called in StateMachineUpdater#takeSnapshot. I think follower where snapshot is getting installed would not call takeSnapshot until later and thus may not be able to purge logs.\r\n\r\n> 1. Instead of purging logs when they need to be evicted from cache, can the purge implementation be fixed to also consider the logs  on disk and not in cache. With this approach, we would have  to take care of tracking on disk logs for other cases as well (for example {{RaftLog#getStartIndex}}).\r\n\r\nThe change will not purge logs when they need to be evicted. If you look at SegmentedRaftLogCache#evictCache it only evicts the entry cache. It still tracks the log segment in the SegmentedRaftLogCache#closedSegments list.

The log segment references should be light-weight if the entry cache is evicted from the log segment. I think we can avoid directory scan during purge with this precondition.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/673994822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/674437550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/177#issuecomment-674437550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/177","id":674437550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQzNzU1MA==","user":{"login":"szetszwo","id":907380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/szetszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-15T19:17:35Z","updated_at":"2020-08-15T19:17:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anshkhannasbu , TestDataStream failed.

follower.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/684161345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/684163270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/188#issuecomment-684163270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/188","id":684163270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDE2MzI3MA==","user":{"login":"runzhiwang","id":51938049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTM4MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51938049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/runzhiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-01T02:54:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T02:54:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hanishakoneru
