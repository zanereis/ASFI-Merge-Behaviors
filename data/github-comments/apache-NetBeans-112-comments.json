Cosmetic changes by us nothing, but take time to review and see where breaks might have been introduced. PRs should fix problems, not cosmetics.\r\n\r\nExactly. Cosmetic changes add noise for little gain *and* introduce some risk in the implementation. NetBeans has >500k lines of code, and we use `import static`sparingly. Same applies for using the `this.` prefix, we use this sparingly in those other >500k files.\r\n\r\nIf you feel an urge to use `import static` for logging levels then it's better to have a single PR do this in 500k files than having 500k PRs changing each file. \r\n\r\nAlso modifying the implementation (of classes that are very sensitive to changes, since this module is probably used by everybody) and the tests at the same time is weird/risky. It's more difficult to know if the new code coming from somebody we don't know (or, as you say, _\"knows too little\"_) behaves the same as before. Until you gain experience I'd prefer PRs with tests only and PRs with code changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1121957029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1122269997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4084#issuecomment-1122269997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4084","id":1122269997,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5C5Hst","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-10T11:32:29Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T11:32:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks

Hi @BradWalker ,\r\n> \r\n> What about supporting SPARC for at least one NetBeans release (i.e., until cnd is merged to master and we make the next release) and drop it later on? By doing so users that own SPARC can at least use that Apache NetBeans version with cnd support.\r\n> \r\n> Also maybe we want to discuss this in the mailing lists, for a broader audience.\r\n\r\nI get it. Sun was the first professional co. that I started my career at. I worked on the team that ported SunOS (before Solaris) over to SPARC. It has a deep emotional attachment for me. But, I just can't see anyone using it. I made me sad when OpenJDK officially shutdown support for it.\r\n\r\nIt's got a lot of cruft associated with it. So I'm trying to make the code base easier to support. And just so you are aware, I'm expecting to probably be the one supporting it, if it stays around since I have a working 64bit SPARC machine. Actually several. 8-)\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll just turn my attention to removing FORTRAN support because I really can't see anyone supporting that one at the moment.. 8-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1124373507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1124386796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4063#issuecomment-1124386796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4063","id":1124386796,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5DBMfs","user":{"login":"pandemonica","id":1839342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzkzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1839342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica","html_url":"https://github.com/pandemonica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandemonica/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-11T23:40:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T23:40:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I removed the offending dirs and restarted.

IMO up to @ebarboni whether to update this PR with working pre-goals or not merge.

Crazy.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1127420762/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1127428655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4108#issuecomment-1127428655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4108","id":1127428655,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5DMzIv","user":{"login":"jhorvath","id":211489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath","html_url":"https://github.com/jhorvath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhorvath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-16T09:16:37Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T09:16:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\nIt needs version in the filename and there was mistake in the header as well.
