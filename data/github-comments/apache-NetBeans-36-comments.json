When I apply this patch, those errors go away.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even with this patch applied, I now very frequently have other problems with Compile-on-Save, e.g. symbols that are not indexed (for \"Find Usages\" or \"Go to Symbol\"), red error badges on files that won't go away unless I turn CoS off and do a clean build etc. I am imagining that these latest errors were not as frequent in NetBeans 10 (with the patch in this PR applied).\r\n\r\nI see that Jaroslav's patch https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1123 was merged into NetBeans 11. How does that patch relate to the one in this PR? Is it meaningful to apply them both in the same build?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/487764396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/487824328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1169#issuecomment-487824328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1169","id":487824328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzgyNDMyOA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T05:22:45Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T05:22:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great, thanks, merge it!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/487824328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/487825875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1197#issuecomment-487825875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1197","id":487825875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzgyNTg3NQ==","user":{"login":"bd2019us","id":47727869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI3ODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47727869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us","html_url":"https://github.com/bd2019us","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bd2019us/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T05:33:38Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T05:33:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Just being curious is this the only one new Date().getTime() in the entire codebase?
