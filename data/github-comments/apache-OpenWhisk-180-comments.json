creation and the scheduler to send a container creation request. But it took around 1.4s for invokers to receive the creation request, it took another 1.4s for the invoker to create a container. Another thing is it took around 3.3s for the controller to actually receive the activation ack after the invoker sent the acks.\r\nI think this is still an improvement point especially regarding Kakfa messing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have achieved what I wanted, I would include https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5334 into this PR and update all CI tests.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1288042098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1288187129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5340#issuecomment-1288187129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5340","id":1288187129,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5MyCz5","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-23T19:55:04Z","updated_at":"2024-10-05T11:32:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/openwhisk/pull/5340?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 76.53%.

Do you think that the additional latency could just be waiting for the kafka consumer / producer to start up? If so that should be rather easy to fix to just wait for the message feed to acknowledge it's finished initializing before marking the service healthy to accept traffic. \r\n\r\nAlso would be helpful knowing the exact series of restart events with the graph you shared.

Do you think that the additional latency could just be waiting for the kafka consumer / producer to start up? If so that should be rather easy to fix to just wait for the message feed to acknowledge it's finished initializing before marking the service healthy to accept traffic.\r\n\r\nIt would be worth analyzing further, though each component has its own warm-up procedure.\r\nEach component has its own warm-up procedure.\r\n- [PoolBalancer](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/core/controller/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/loadBalancer/FPCPoolBalancer.scala#L512)\r\n- [ContainerManager](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/core/scheduler/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/scheduler/container/ContainerManager.scala#L303)\r\n- [InvokerReactive](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/core/invoker/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/invoker/FPCInvokerReactive.scala#L407)\r\n\r\nWhen a new scheduler endpoint is inserted in ETCD, controllers and invokers warm up the path.\r\nWhen an invoker endpoint is inserted, schedulers warm up the container creation path.\r\nFinally, [controllers invoke a warm-up activation](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5338/files#diff-379956107a78f18274d3895bbbb268b964cc5f89ac3601333c4255cc0bb7632dR450) during the deployment time.\r\nIt would be great to double-check the above functionality but I hope that is handled in the subsequent PR as this PR is getting bigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also would be helpful knowing the exact series of restart events with the graph you shared. Are one of each component all being restarted at once? Would we see the same increased latency if we did the controller restart, the scheduler restart, the invoker restart all isolated from one another?\r\n\r\nLet me share the procedures.\r\n\r\n### (Prerequisite) It's important to change the serial value for each component to 1.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat > ${OPENWHISK_HOME}/ansible/invoker.yml << EOL\r\n---\r\n# This playbook deploys Openwhisk Invokers.\r\n\r\n- hosts: invokers\r\n  vars:\r\n    host_group: \"{{ groups['invokers'] }}\"\r\n    name_prefix: \"invoker\"\r\n    invoker_index_base: 0\r\n  serial: '${INVOKER_SERIAL}' ### this should be 1\r\n  roles:\r\n  - invoker\r\nEOL\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo all components are deployed one by one.\r\n\r\n### Deploy OpenWhisk in multiple steps.\r\n\r\nI deployed OW in multiple steps and the deployment order is slightly different.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  if [ \"$STEP\" == \"1\" ]; then\r\n      ## step 1\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD invoker.yml --limit invokers[0:3] # 4 normal invokers\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD scheduler.yml --limit schedulers[0:0] # 3 schedulers\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD controller.yml --limit controllers[0:0] # 2 controllers\r\n  fi\r\n  if [ \"$STEP\" == \"2\" ]; then\r\n      ## step 2\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD controller.yml --limit controllers[1:1] # left 1 controller\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD scheduler.yml --limit schedulers[1:1] # left 1 schedulers\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD invoker.yml --limit invokers[4:6]  # 3 invokers\r\n  fi\r\n  if [ \"$STEP\" == \"3\" ]; then\r\n      ## step 3\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD controller.yml --limit controllers[2:2] # left 1 controller\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD scheduler.yml --limit schedulers[2:2] # left 1 schedulers\r\n      $ANSIBLE_CMD invoker.yml --limit invokers[7:9]  # 3 invokers\r\n  fi\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, with the assumption that all components support graceful shutdown, we need to disable and deploy some invokers.\r\nOnce invokers are deployed, they have a different etcd prefix with old invokers, no request is sent to them from old schedulers.\r\n\r\nSecond, we can disable and deploy one scheduler.\r\nOnce the scheduler is deployed, it also has a different prefix and no request is sent to this scheduler from old controllers.\r\nAt this point, schedulers and invokers are idle.\r\n\r\nThird, we deploy one controller. During the deployment, the controller is removed from nginx. So no request is sent to the controller. Once it is deployed, it can only see the newly deployed scheduler and invokers. After then it is re-added to Nginx.\r\nSo there are two versions of OW running at this point.\r\n\r\nAfter one step is finished, now we can deploy components in reverse order as there are already available schedulers and invokers.\r\n\r\nSince the serial value of each component is 1, we don't necessarily need to split the procedure into 3 steps.\r\nBut at least 2 steps are required for zero downtime deployment.\r\n\r\nIn the above diagram, there are three points that TPS became 0 shortly. Those points are where controllers are deployed.\r\nExcept for those points, other components were being deployed one by one.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1289868836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1291619550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5341#issuecomment-1291619550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5341","id":1291619550,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5M_Ize","user":{"login":"jinlang226","id":54641709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQxNzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54641709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226","html_url":"https://github.com/jinlang226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinlang226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-26T07:34:05Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T07:35:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I encountered a new error.

So take the same example from the description and say that there are 6 existing containers. The second code block will create 1 container for the stale activations and 5 containers for the 100 available messages that are not stale bringing us to the correct 11 capacity in one scheduling interval. If there were already 10 containers available like in the original example and we just need 1 additional container for the stale activations it would enter the `else if` case and just add the 1 container to account for the stale activations to bring it to 11.\r\n            ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1292752659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1292901981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5344#issuecomment-1292901981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5344","id":1292901981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5NEB5d","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-27T02:58:38Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T04:15:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/openwhisk/pull/5344?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `92.85714%` with `1 line` in your changes missing coverage.

It's ok as I used moderate loads, but anyway, I wanted to avoid such a case.\r\nAnd we can deploy multiple components at once as long as we reverse the order at the second deployment.\r\n\r\n> * If we
