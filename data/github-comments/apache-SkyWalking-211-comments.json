If I want a portion of all the samples to be sampled, a fixed `sample_n_per_3_secs` would not work very well because it's kind of hard to determine what value should be used for it. If I set it relative to QPS = 100, too less samples would be sampled when QPS = 10000. If I set it relative to QPS = 10000, all the traces in other time might be sampled. Besides I need know the current QPS in order to set it right. In this case if one can just specify a number indicating the percentage rate, it would be way easier to achieve this.\r\n\r\nAlso we do understand that the sample rate would not be accurate, that's expected. This plugin doesn't intend to be accurate either.\r\nIn summary this plugin just provides another way to specify how often one would like traces to be sampled, please consider its use cases. Not all users need this of course, but maybe some users would consider this useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/759488732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/759499824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6177#issuecomment-759499824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6177","id":759499824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTQ5OTgyNA==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-13T14:53:24Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T14:53:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Updated
