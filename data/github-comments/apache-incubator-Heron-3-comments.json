Should we provide \"Ability to configure client classpath\"?\n   I think so, as @ashvina mentioned the issue. We need to provide a way to specify extra classpath for running scheduler.\n2. Is this classpath used only on client side?\n   @ashvina said yes, but I want to confirm with this. Implementation of IScheduler (In your case, the driver or application master part)will run on server side; does the classpath also need to be specified for the Implementation of IScheduler too? If so, current #272 is not enough; Launcher needs to get this classpath to correctly construct the command to start SchedulerMain, i.e. correctly set the value of classpath for SchedulerMain.\n3. How to provide \"Ability to configure client classpath\"?\n   #272 gets classpath argument from cli and pass it to execute java_class. \n   It is not a good solution: it requires people to specify this classpath every time they submit a topology, which is unneeded and annoying.\n   We should provide a config for extra_scheduler_class, (in this case, the default value can be hadoop related jars) and cli will pick up this config when trying to run scheduler related JVM process. Also, we can also provide --classpath option to override the default value to provide more flexibility.\n4. When providing an option to override the value, I don't think \"-classpath\" is a good name, since topology developers can also set additional classpath for their topologies instances in topology Config; the name \"classpath\" causes confusion. \"scheduler_classpath\" can be a better one; or any other good names eliminating confusion with classpath for topology instances.\n5. A small implementation question on #272 \n   why add one more argument in method execute.heron_class(..), rather than directly pass the value to arguments \"extra_jars\"? (Will point it out in the PR too.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206163587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206176599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/271#issuecomment-206176599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/271","id":206176599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjE3NjU5OQ==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T07:20:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T07:23:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My answers are - \n\nfor 2) @ashvina confirmed that is only being on the cli side. \n\nfor 3) the bigger picture is the use of heronrc or user specified heronrc.

concerns;\n1. w.r.t #138.\n\nAccording to the description, \"“.heronrc” is a simple configuration file to support repeated overriding options, instead of typing those options\", I don't think it is a suitable place to save the default value of --scheduler-classpath option, since this value varies basing on different scheduler, rather than varies basing on different users. For instance, yarn-scheduler requires hadoop jar in classpath while mesos-scheduler requires mesos jar. “.heronrc” is designed to save something like “role” or repeated overriding options basing on a particular user.\n\nFurthermore, I doubt the idea to have ““.heronrc””:\n1) “.heronrc” can reduce repeated overriding options. But then the overriding options will be spitted into 2 parts: one part is in “.heronrc” while another one is in command line. It makes debug harder.\n2) I also doubt whether “.heronrc” does reduce repeated overriding options a lot. \n- Practically, people have a script (or copy-parse the command) to invoke heron-cli; they don’t have to type the repeated options again and again.\n- There are very few options fitting with “.heronrc”; most of them should be taken care by heron/config. I doubt the need to add one extra file.\n\n2.\n@ashvina When we run client side’s scheduler code (Launcher, Uploader or RuntimeManager), we “$HERON_HOME/lib/scheduler” and” $HERON_HOME/lib/uploader” into the classpath (we do something similar when running IScheduler on sever side). One possible workaround is to build a fat jar including necessary dependencies and put it under lib/scheduler folder. What do you think of this workaround?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206518986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206537039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/278#issuecomment-206537039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/278","id":206537039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjUzNzAzOQ==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T20:07:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T20:07:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"tx

I am doing something similar currently and it does not seem to be the right solution.\nOr are you suggesting to copy the required jars to lib/scheduler until a long term fix is available?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206569607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206598686","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/279#issuecomment-206598686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/279","id":206598686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjU5ODY4Ng==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T22:37:05Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T22:37:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206598686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/206610912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/277#issuecomment-206610912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/277","id":206610912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjYxMDkxMg==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T23:05:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T23:05:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Prabhu - just one comment, instead of changing the directory structure, can we change the package itself?

All hadoop jars are NOT packaged, only versioned independent api classes are packaged. That way the packaged version of the scheduler is small and does not include any version dependent classes. Before submitting a Topology, the cluster version specific jobs are copied to $HERON_HOME/lib/scheduler folder (Note: these jars are needed by the client to submitting job to the cluster. Hadoop jars are already available on the cluster nodes and hence not needed there). This way any conflicts are avoided too.\n\nFor submitting a hadoop job, jars set in `HADOOP_CLASSPATH` are included in the hadoop client classpath. There is a different option for copying user jar on all the nodes where job will run. I think a solution matching this would be simple and complete. Changes via .heronrc may not be needed. Alternatively I am inclining towards adding a script to copy required jars from `HADOOP_HOME` to  lib/scheduler.\n\nDoes this sound ok?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/207568973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/207570277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/299#issuecomment-207570277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/299","id":207570277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzU3MDI3Nw==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T19:31:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T19:31:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@billonahill - release/BUILD file is going away.

It is possible that Heron might be installed in a system directory such as /usr/local/heron - which might not have permission to copy.  Instead, if we could include the HADOOP_CLASSPATH to be in the classpath in the CLI (interally), probably it might be easier. Let me check with the team tomorrow and make a concrete proposal. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/208161209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/208430878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/306#issuecomment-208430878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/306","id":208430878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODQzMDg3OA==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T16:14:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T16:14:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kramasamy the user doesn't need to install semver since it's committed in the repo and referenced directly via it's path.\n\nDo we have any docs for how we launch instances on Docker?
