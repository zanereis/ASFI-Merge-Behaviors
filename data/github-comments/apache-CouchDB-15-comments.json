(This can be achieved e.g. by setting the\n   `password` field when updating the user document. This works even if\n   the password doesn't get changed at all.)\n\nI also have a use case for the feature.\n\nTogether with @robertkowalski, I've been working on a small plugin that\nprovides passwordless authentication by sending the authenticating user\na sign-in link via email [1]. The sign-in link contains an\nauthentication token, which gets exchanged for a CouchDB authentication\ncookie the first time a user follows the sign-in link. Thereby, we want\nto make sure that that every authentication token can only be used once,\nand that for a given user there can only be one valid authentication\ntoken at a time.\n\nPreviously, we would always set a new password for each sign-in, and\nthereby involuntarily invalidate all authentication cookies for that\nuser when creating a new authentication token. This is big show-stopper\ngiven the fact that people nowadays tend to switch between different\ndevices all the time. Not being able to authenticate with more than one\nbrowser at a time is not acceptable. Aside from that, we however still\nwant to make it possible to invalidate all of a particular user's\nauthentication cookies.\n\nAlthough we found a solution that matches our requirements, it took us\nquite some time. Implementing the same functionality would have been way\neasier if this feature had been available. The resulting code would be\nless complex and therefore easier to understand. I guess I don't need to\nexplain why this is critical when dealing with sensitive stuff like\nauthentication.\n\n[1] https://github.com/KlausTrainer/couch_email_auth\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/155241623/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/155241653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/366#issuecomment-155241653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/366","id":155241653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTI0MTY1Mw==","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T00:21:34Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T00:21:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'd played around with both @janl and Cloudant solutions and figure out the cases when this feature becomes very useful.

I only found the one way is to change the salt what is basically means that I revoke all the tokens. With Jan's approach I can do this per user basis.

A little bit more work to do, but it brings more order in the house.\n\nJan, please continue your work here.\n\nHowever, it's still not clear how users with delegated auth will handle expired token case (when we cannot prolong it automagically).

The whole point of delegated authentication is to not care about such issues, I guess ;) You either trust the identity provider completely, or you don't trust it at all. That is, you do want to be able to revoke all tokens that have been issued by the identity provider, without revoking all other tokens (cookies) at the same time.\n\nBtw., regarding delegated authentication, I'd like CouchDB to support JSON Web Tokens (JWT). I created a working prototype for JWT support a while ago, see https://github.com/KlausTrainer/couchdb-couch/tree/jwt. The larger parts that are still missing are tests and documentation. I definitely want to get back to that, but feel like working on 2.0 blockers is a bit more important right now ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/155251011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/155252688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/366#issuecomment-155252688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/366","id":155252688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTI1MjY4OA==","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T01:21:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T01:21:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@KlausTrainer Well, if I gave someone auth_token for my CouchDB and this someone started to do bad things there, I would like to make sure I can ban him.

exists to ensure that connection is alive, active and operable, but not to keep it forever (this is actually should be done with timeout=infinity).

Application level keep-alive is the only way to instantly figure out that things went wrong and time to reconnect. Websockets are effective in unreliable networks because of such approach (ping/pong).\n\nOtherwise we have quite strange case when you do request `GET /db/_changes?feed=continuous&heartbeat=1000&timeout=60000` expecting that timeout will work as usually, but actually it get ignored.
