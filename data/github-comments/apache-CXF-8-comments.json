I'm not sure whether condition \"tlsServerParameters.getClientAuthentication() != null\" is strong enough. Whether it is possible to want https without this parameter.Code from [1] seems that having it is the only way how to force undertow to use ssl. (other option is to check whether at least one property is not null - but it is ugly and error causing solution)\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nJiri\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/master/rt/transports/http-undertow/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/http_undertow/UndertowHTTPServerEngine.java#L277","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/465536683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/465541762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/513#issuecomment-465541762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/513","id":465541762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTU0MTc2Mg==","user":{"login":"ffang","id":663583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang","html_url":"https://github.com/ffang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T11:46:03Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T11:46:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @JiriOndrusek \r\n\r\nI don't think your change in that PR is correct.\r\n\r\n\"tlsServerParameters.getClientAuthentication() != null\" isn't a compulsory requirement for  HTTPS protocol\r\n\r\nFreeman","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/465541762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/465572151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/513#issuecomment-465572151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/513","id":465572151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTU3MjE1MQ==","user":{"login":"JiriOndrusek","id":26897889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODk3ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26897889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek","html_url":"https://github.com/JiriOndrusek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiriOndrusek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T13:24:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T13:24:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Problem is probably not in cxf.

Sounds ok - we can think about having a getClassFromModel instead, cdi will need Annotated and not Class in some rare cases. For spring model is the class but it would depend the \"deployer\" - hiw classes are scanned/registered.\r\n2. Almost, the list would be generic. You would get a CompositeClassUnwrapper usable in spring apps but also cdi and standalone apps. Wonder if know proxies should be handled by default or not wrapping user unwrapper hut guess with a composite reusable class taking a list of unwrappers it is not immediately needed.\r\n\r\nHope it is clearer","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/478843415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/479082569","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/531#issuecomment-479082569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/531","id":479082569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTA4MjU2OQ==","user":{"login":"davidkarlsen","id":18299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen","html_url":"https://github.com/davidkarlsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkarlsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T16:32:33Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T16:32:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@coheigea any thoughts on this one?\r\nBTW: Are updated snapshots pushed out anywhere?
