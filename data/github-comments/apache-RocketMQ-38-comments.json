Thanks for your reply.\r\nIn some scenarios, it's necessary to create multi consumers. For example, suppose we have messages in two topics. One contains fewer messages, but each one takes a long consumption time, and the other is the opposite. In such a situation,  subscribing these topics in one consumer maybe not a good choice. Because the few but heavy messages may block all ConsumeThreads, which leads to the another topic consumption latency. Here we need two isolated thread pools (consumer) for these two topics.\r\nFor your second question, I think `ConsumerGroup` as a part of` ConsumeThread` name is more intuitive than  `instance`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/517272825/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/517272930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1233#issuecomment-517272930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1233","id":517272930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzI3MjkzMA==","user":{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T12:49:34Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T12:49:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bix29 it seems that it's a openssl issue, could you pull a request to resolve this problem? and it seems that only OpenSSL 1.0.2 or previous version has this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/517272930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/517577219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1340#issuecomment-517577219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1340","id":517577219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzU3NzIxOQ==","user":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-02T06:48:48Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T06:48:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tyshan you could find the consumer thread is always running.
