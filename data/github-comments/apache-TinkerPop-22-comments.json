The snippet you provided will throw an error with an Asyncio or Tornado client, as you can only call [`result()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Future.result) on a completed future. You will typically need to `yield/yield from/await` it first depending on the Python version and driver (like in the examples provided above). However, the underlying coroutine will spawn independently, which means that even if you don't `yield/yield from/await`, but you wait long enough before calling `result()` it will complete. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfuture = g.V().promise(lambda t: t.toList())\r\nassert not future.done()  # Future has not completed\r\nawait asyncio.sleep(5)  # Simulate doing a ton of other blocking stuff\r\nassert future.done()  # Future has completed (assuming 5 seconds was enough time to complete)\r\nresult = future.result()  # Doesn't throw an error

Here is the saving grace -- if someone comes up with a better solution, there are only two classes we need to tweak (`Bytecode` and `Bindings`). `Bindings` (besides as a singleton) are never accessed outside of these two classes. Moreover, most of the `Bindings` methods are `protected` and thus, not exposed to users. Only `of` is exposed.\r\n\r\nI'll merge and perhaps someone down the road comes up with the better solution. ?.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/264169729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/264171666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/507#issuecomment-264171666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/507","id":264171666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDE3MTY2Ng==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T13:21:42Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T13:21:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yea, go ahead and merge it.

I implemented this API for gremlin-python. There is one major problem: side effects. Since the current side effect API is designed to be synchronous (calling `run_sync`), it cannot be used inside a coroutine, as  demonstrated by this [test](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/54fac5146a5ac067e75f2fbfe135fae2da641c35/gremlin-python/src/main/jython/tests/driver/test_driver_remote_connection.py#L210). This is problematic for a Tornado or Asyncio based driver. I think in the future we should consider the possibility that the `promise()` method return a `AsyncSideEffect` object so the end user can leverage the async techniques with side effects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/265537458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/265542180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/478#issuecomment-265542180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/478","id":265542180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTU0MjE4MA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T19:10:43Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T19:10:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm rebasing on `tp32` to clean up that conflict. this branch was pretty far behind.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/265542180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/265557622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/478#issuecomment-265557622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/478","id":265557622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTU1NzYyMg==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T20:03:55Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T20:03:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebase is complete now -
