for surfacing a few more options, @kennknowles. After looking at a few, my preference is for AutoValue. Some notes on each:\n\n**AutoValue**:\n- Most popular (based on GitHub stars; I couldn't find a source of Maven stats)\n- Standard annotation processor; fully-supported in Maven, IntelliJ & Eclipse\n- Generated code is hidden; no user-visible API\n- Very flexible usage patterns\n\n**lombok**\n- Also very popular\n- Supports many use-cases other than immutable type-generation. Feels more like adding language features on top of Java, similar to Typescript does for Javascript\n- Mutates source classes; as you note, this contradicts the annotation processor spec and may not play nicely with IDEs.\n- Generates visible APIs; harder to follow code without access to generated code or knowledge of lombok.\n\n**immutables**\n- Much less popular than AutoValue and lombok\n- Most similar to AutoValue, but supports generating interface implementations.\n- Much more configuration-driven; lots of knobs to customize generated implementations since they are typically API-visible. As a result, there seems to be much more library-specific code.\n\n**FreeBuilder**\n- Much less popular than AutoValue and lombok\n- Strives only to support builder pattern; factory methods not supported.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/209150951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/209162108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/163#issuecomment-209162108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/163","id":209162108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTE2MjEwOA==","user":{"login":"davorbonaci","id":8442684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDI2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8442684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci","html_url":"https://github.com/davorbonaci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davorbonaci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T00:22:45Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T00:22:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.
