for notifying @fhueske! And sorry for not noticing this earlier and jumping on so late.\r\n\r\nI think this part of the API is already to bloated and (at the same time) not powerful enough. These functions don't allow having multiple \"aggregations\" in one operation, i.e. you cannot do `inputStream.keyBy(...).min(1).andMax(2).andSum(3)` (not actual API). I think in the long run we should remove this part of the API because the Table API is a nicer way of expressing simple aggregations.

The WebUI periodically sends requests to the backend, which will asks the EGHolder, which then asks the JM if it doesn't find the job in the cache. Now, if we remove the suspended EG we will in fact keep polling the JM until the job was recovered.\r\n\r\nThis is actually the same behavior that you would have if the job is suspended and the

In all newer tests, we try to do that.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295290466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295290898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3738#issuecomment-295290898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3738","id":295290898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTI5MDg5OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T14:32:46Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T14:32:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.

Adding a multiple MBs dependency to write `Lists.newArrayList` rather than `new ArrayList<>()` also seems a bit much. The use of the `Joiner` can also be replaced with a `StringBuilder`.\r\n\r\n  - You can drop the `logback-test.xml` - I think this is an uneeded artifact that some other modules still have for historic reasons.\r\n\r\n  - Would be good to also put the final datadog reporter jar into the `opt` folder in the build target, so it can be easily dropped into the `lib` folder by users when needed. Have a look at the `opt.xml` assembly descriptor to see how the other reporters do that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295293585/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/295296245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3738#issuecomment-295296245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3738","id":295296245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTI5NjI0NQ==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T14:48:36Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T14:48:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@StephanEwen
