The problems of the union query you mentioned above are correct and still exist.

The outputs of these pipelines are queried together, and they share some dimensions and have some unique dimensions, as well as unique metrics. We also produce intra-day computations of these data sets that are updated with daily true-ups. The output of an intra-day run needs to overshadow any existing output for the time it's running for, which can be handled by overshadowing, but the intra-day output of a conversion pipeline shouldn't affect the output of any other pipeline, so simply synchronizing on version and using a linear shard spec won't work. Union data sources, if they were performant, could likely handle this without too much trouble since we're only discussing a few distinct input sources. In our case, most queries actually cover over a hundred namespaces. At that scale, I'm not sure how performant unioning would be (possibly fine). The main benefit namespacing provides is that clients don't need to know or care about these details, nor do they need to know _which_ data sources to union. I agree with the overall point that this all could be done in the query layer (and perhaps even should be done there).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598465621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598491420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9463#issuecomment-598491420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9463","id":598491420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODQ5MTQyMA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-13T00:35:55Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T00:35:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, I agree with your concerns about 100+ dataSource scale in union. My guess is that it could still be handled by pushing the union dataSource to Historicals .

Since you can track what task created what segments from task audit logs, you can overwrite only the segments what you want with segment locking. (The task audit logging is deprecated because we haven't found a good use case for it. If this is a popular use case, then we may need to consider supporting it back. See https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5859 for details.). But it requires you to track all segments outside of Druid and I guess this would be more complex than the proposal.\r\n\r\nAs long as there is no unique use case where only this proposal can address, I'm more inclined to fixing the union query properly because we have to do it anyway. As @himanshug mentioned, that could address most of the problems mentioned here even though there is at least one more potential issue with query performance. The segment balancer uses a heuristic that the segments will be more likely queried together as their intervals are closer. Based on this heuristic, the segment balancer assigns the segments of close intervals into different historicals so that they can be processed in parallel. This assumption doesn't apply to the union query. However, I don't know what the impact of this would be.\r\n\r\n> That problem is a lot more cosmetic . It could either be handled by introducing concept of \"Virtual DataSource\" at the api layer on top of Druid that typically customers have or could be implemented as a feature in Druid itself.\r\n\r\n@himanshug this is true.

You can not do ingestion via the query layer, that is not what i said. What you can do and trying to explain is that it is better to have a datasource per costumer, that will lead to better overall management and query performance. If you need to have a view on the top of those multiple customers then we can add something in the query path like a global view to allow that, but in any case you need to do a separate ingestion for each customer.
