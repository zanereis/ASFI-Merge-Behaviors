As described in [pattern analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-pattern-analyzer.html), it uses Java Regular Expressions. We have to think about the performance, further more, a badly written regular expression input by user could run very slowly or even throw a StackOverflowError and cause the node it is running on to exit suddenly.\r\n\r\nActually, I don't have good idea about this issue now. I'm inclined to support the both \"fuzzy\" and \"accurate\" type query. If the user have no background knowledges of the analyzer of Elasticsearch, they can choose \"accurate\"  type,  input the complete endpoint to query and then get the accurate result, otherwise, they can choose the fuzzy type as now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/658591759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/658596186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5100#issuecomment-658596186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5100","id":658596186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODU5NjE4Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T07:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T07:26:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"TotalDuration = SelfDuration + duration(s) of child spans.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/658596186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/658627474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5101#issuecomment-658627474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5101","id":658627474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODYyNzQ3NA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-15T08:31:26Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T08:31:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> It 's common to use global exception handler in spring.

Controlling the workflow by exception is rude and low-performance. \r\nBut if you do that, you have to change the source codes on your own. SkyWalking wouldn't take that responsibility because if we do so, we have to check every exception and iterate its parent, it will burn the agent in heavy traffic systems.
