Perhaps 24 months distance can help put it in a new light and get this ball rolling again? I'm also keen on CB on the update side of Solr.\r\n> \r\nReplying to this from the beginning of the summer.\r\n\r\nWhere I work now, we use circuit breakers and the current ones aren’t really doing the job, so I wish this patch had been accepted back then. I’m trying to make some time to revisit it, but it isn’t on our schedule yet.\r\n\r\nThe experience certainly was discouraging and not very close to Yonik’s Law of Patches, if that is still a thing in Solr. That was a working, tested, and documented fix that was rejected.\r\n\r\nI did look at doing it in two steps, as one comment suggested. I think that makes more of a mess, because it means documenting the CPU circuit breaker as using load average, then breaking that documented behavior when it is fixed to use CPU. As one big change, we can make the CPU CB use CPU and rename the current one to a Load Average CB.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to allow and even prefer thresholds like “1.00” instead of having “100” mean “1.0”. I didn’t do that work in the original patch. That could easily be layered on later.\r\n\r\nwunder\r\nWalter Underwood\r\n***@***.***\r\nhttp://observer.wunderwood.org/  (my blog)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1687150222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1687328255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1827#issuecomment-1687328255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1827","id":1687328255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5kkpX_","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T02:38:31Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T02:38:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Instructions:  https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork#enabling-repository-maintainer-permissions-on-existing-pull-requests\r\n\r\nSomehow I think it can be set to automatic so you don't have to think about it henceforth, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAbout some changes I did:\r\n* Don't use SolrTestCaseHS at all, even the assertJQ thing.

In my patch i completely disabled CSP response for all other endpoints than the `AdminUIServlet`. I cannot see a reason to return that header for other endpoints. The only I can think of is if you have a solr package that exposes another UI on some path, it could be nice to protect that UI with CSP rules, so if it would be possible to have some fallback CSP header for all other requests perhaps?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1697241385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1697342481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1851#issuecomment-1697342481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1851","id":1697342481,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5lK2QR","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-29T12:23:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T12:23:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ugh...

I'm reviving this PR. I am going to push a large commit to the PR branch, bringing it up to date with the latest changes related to pluggable breakers.\r\n\r\nWrt the split between `LoadAverageCircuitBreaker` and `CPUCircuitBreaker`, I have [stated before](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/96#issuecomment-853442218) that I support @wrunderwood and @sigram that they should be separate. The difference is clearly documented in the ref guide.\r\n\r\nWrt backward compatibility for those upgrading from 8.x or 9.x, I'm switching the deprecated `CircuitBreakerManager` plugin to create an instance of `LoadAverageCircuitBreaker` when `cpuThreshold` is configured. That way there is no surprise for old users, while new users can make an active choice when picking a plugin. I am not adding support for the new cpu breaker in `CircuitBreakerManager`. I hope this is a good compromise.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR may conflict somewhat with #1871 which is still not merged. We'll handle that once one of them are merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1698957157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1699057850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1872#issuecomment-1699057850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1872","id":1699057850,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5lRZC6","user":{"login":"mkhludnev","id":807522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev","html_url":"https://github.com/mkhludnev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T12:18:41Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T12:18:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks you, Dustin. \r\nWould you mind to create cherry-picking PR to branch_9x ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1699057850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1699058232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1872#issuecomment-1699058232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1872","id":1699058232,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5lRZI4","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-30T12:18:56Z","updated_at":"2023-08-30T12:18:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @dustinpeerce !

This is a tricky decision, changing behavior to match the documentation. Is it a breaking change or not? How many people read the code and figured out it wasn't CPU? Anybody? Our clusters with 300+ shards were configured assuming it was CPU usage (max 100%) until I explained otherwise.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add a note to the docs about using circuit breakers in a sharded system, because they multiply failures.

In a sharded system, it is probably worth enabling partial results to avoid that.\r\n\r\nA future feature would be an option to only check the circuit breakers on the initial external request, not on the distributed requests to shards. That has advantages (no partial failures) and disadvantages (can't reject the portion of the load which is intra-cluster).
