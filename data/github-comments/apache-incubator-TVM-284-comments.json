The ultimate goal of TensorIR is to replace the current TE schedule. \r\n\r\nBefore integrating it to `relay`, we need to finish all of our M2 items (there are only two left). Here are the following steps:\r\n- TensorIR docs and tutorial\r\n- Relay integration\r\n- Meta Schedule(AutoTIR) https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8473","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/906972044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/906994739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8645#issuecomment-906994739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8645","id":906994739,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42D6Qz","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T07:36:17Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T07:36:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is merged now.

While #7987 converts TE compute dag to TensorIR, we cannot reuse TOPI's schedule and AutoTVM schedule templates. However, as meta schedule is coming to the rescue, in most of the cases, schedule can be generated automatically with meta schedule. We are designing some APIs to allow customized schedule as well.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss more if you are interested :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907032840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907054610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8846#issuecomment-907054610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8846","id":907054610,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42EI4S","user":{"login":"mehrdadh","id":6409345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDkzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6409345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh","html_url":"https://github.com/mehrdadh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehrdadh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T09:14:09Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T09:14:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@masahi no worries.\r\n@junrushao1994 I did test it with repeat and it still breaks.

We will make TensorIR be an optional but not the default backend of relay as our first step. There must be many works (including meta schedule and some corner cases that meta schedule can not generate automatically) to do before totally switching TE to TensorIR. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you really want to use TensorIR in compilation flow before meta-schedule, you may have to rewrite TOPI schedules you need. Theoretically, we can use both TE and TensorIR in one relay network (i.e., use TensorIR for one special Op but use TE for the rest). Unfortunately, our current implementation does not support it. And we haven't decided if we will support it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907176062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907200410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7527#issuecomment-907200410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7527","id":907200410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42Esea","user":{"login":"manupak","id":61496855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDk2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61496855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak","html_url":"https://github.com/manupak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manupak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T13:23:56Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T13:23:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ack, Many thanks for the info 🙂!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907200410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/907293887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8814#issuecomment-907293887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8814","id":907293887,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42FDS_","user":{"login":"jtuyls","id":17315610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE1NjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17315610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls","html_url":"https://github.com/jtuyls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtuyls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T15:40:34Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T15:40:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leandron I can add the dependencies to the `gen_requirements.py`.
