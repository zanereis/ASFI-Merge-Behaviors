左边panel列的字体大小有点过大，建议小一点。 | SoMuchLight | 优化建议 | 2021/08/04\r\n目录树 | 查询结果panel的上界要是能拖拽拉高或者拉低会更好。 | SoMuchLight | 优化建议 | 2021/08/04\r\nSQL查询 | 新建查询->执行一条查询语句->然后把原来的查询语句改成一条新查询语句再执行的时候就卡住了。 | SoMuchLight | 新增功能 | 2021/08/04\r\nSQL查询 | 查询很多列时结果中的Time列宽度不够，得鼠标移上去才能看到时间戳完整的值。 | SoMuchLight | 优化建议 | 2021/08/04\r\nSQL查询 | SQL查询需要选中执行 | 用户 | 优化建议 | 2021/08/04\r\nSQL查询 | SQL空格回车无法插入新行 | 用户 | 优化建议

缺少对物理量数据的增删改查功能，可以出一个批量增加数据数据的功能，方便测试。 | 海洋啊啊 | 新增功能 | 2021/08/04\r\n数据库账号权限 | 支持账号角色功能 | 海洋啊啊 | 新增功能 | 2021/08/04\r\n技术类 | 1.没有事务支撑,需要进行代码优化2.Sql注入问题需要深入研究，对代码进行优化3.是否将代码里的少部分写死数据改为可配置，比如权限列表，可能会增加，方便后续迭代开发4.Iotdb存在api接口和命令行操作不一致的情况，例如调接口可以生成root.root这样的存储组，而命令行输入是会提示报错，(已在界面做限制保证同步操作)这样的bug需要后端人员熟悉iotdb，多操作命令和调用接口，多比较5.系统版本和iotdb系统版本的同步问题，建议先稳定好当前版本，因为iotdb本身也存在很多bug，最好稳定之后再同步;另外用户可能是不同版本的iotdb，后续是否支持多个版本。目前系统使用版本是0.12.0版本。6.是否提供多种部署方案，目前采用打jar包部署 | 海洋啊啊 | 待定 | 2021/08/04\r\n时间序列 | 创建时间序列时课指定压缩方式，包含：UNCOMPRESSED（不压缩）、 SNAPPY（默认方式）、 LZ4、 GZIP。此外还支持旋转门压缩（SDT）算法 | 内部梳理 | 新增功能 | 2021/08/04\r\n时间序列 | 时间序列增加别名alias，标签tag和属性attribute的增删改 | 内部梳理 | 新增功能
