That example handles projection, which was mentioned in one of the review comments.\r\n\r\nSince the regex is file-specific, the regex format plugin is most useful if it can be configured per-file using table functions. See [DRILL-6167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6167), [DRILL-6168](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6168) and [DRILL-6169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6169) for problems that will be encountered. See the example and tests above for how to work around the bugs.\r\n\r\nAlthough I suggested looking at the `ResultSetLoader`, it is a bit premature to do so. That mechanism relies on additional mechanisms that have not yet been committed to master. So, we need to work with the mechanisms we have now. See the example reader above for how to cache the per-column mutator needed to write to vectors without the switch statements in the code in this PR.\r\n\r\nTo generalize, the example has an object per column that holds per-column info. The example uses only `VarChar` columns. To add additional types, create a base column state class with subclasses for each type. Then, simply call a `save(String value)` method to write a column. That method can handle nulls (for projected non-existent columns) and type conversions (where needed).\r\n\r\nFinally, feel free to borrow liberally from the example. (The example was created for our Drill book, so is fair game to reuse.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/366826001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/366855329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1011#issuecomment-366855329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1011","id":366855329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Njg1NTMyOQ==","user":{"login":"agirish","id":2224090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2224090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish","html_url":"https://github.com/agirish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T03:11:52Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T03:11:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, I'll give it a try and update with my findings.

@arina-ielchiieva I should have updated this PR earlier this week, here is my update. After reflecting on Arina's comments and reading some more docs about how java implements volatile and synchronization, I think this solution might not fix the original race condition. I need to do more reading to get a better understanding. Additionally I realized there is another race condition where two threads are simultaneously calling close and innerNext which could cause a memory leak. Haven't had a chance to dig further this week, so I will try to wrap this up next week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/367936806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/368183640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1104#issuecomment-368183640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1104","id":368183640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODE4MzY0MA==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-24T01:13:41Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T01:13:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/368183640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/368240910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1111#issuecomment-368240910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1111","id":368240910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODI0MDkxMA==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-24T16:39:53Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T16:39:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1.   merged the PR in commit 27aa236.

There were several issues with the original code.\r\n\r\n1. It made incorrect assumptions about how cache invalidation works with java **synchronized**.\r\n2. It assumed **innerNext** and **close** would be called sequentially.\r\n\r\nI believe this PR fixes these issues now and I have gone into more detail about the problems below.\r\n\r\n# 1. Incorrect Cache Invalidation Assumptions\r\n\r\nThe original code was trying to be smart by trying to reduce synchronization overhead on **innerNext**. So the code in **innerNext** did not synchronize before changing the partitioner object since this would be called often. The code in **close()** and **receivingFragmentFinished()** synchronized before accessing the partitioner with the intention that this would trigger an update of the partitioner variable state across all threads. Unfortunately, this assumption is invalid (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22706739/does-synchronized-guarantee-a-thread-will-see-the-latest-value-of-a-non-volatile). Every thread that accesses a variable must synchronize before accessing a variable in order to properly invalidate cached data on a core. \r\n\r\nFor example if **Thread A** modifies **Variable 1** then **Thread B** synchronizes before accessing **Variable 1** then there is no guarantee **Thread B** will see the most updated value for **Variable 1** since it might be cached on the core running **Thread A**.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIn summary the right thing to do is the simple thing. Make the methods synchronized. Unfortunately there is no way to outsmart the system and reduce synchronization overhead without causing race conditions.\r\n\r\n# 2. Concurrent InnerNext and Close Calls\r\n\r\nThe original code did not consider the case that innerNext was in the middle of execution when close was called. It did try to handle the case where **innerNext** could be called after **close** by setting the **ok** variable. But it didn't even do that right because there was no synchronization around the **ok** variable.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe right thing to do is the simple thing. Make sure the methods are synchronized so close has to wait until innerNext is done before executing. Also when a query is cancelled the executing thread should be interrupted the thread running innerNext incase it is on a blocking call.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/369798977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/369827620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1141#issuecomment-369827620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1141","id":369827620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTgyNzYyMA==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-02T05:49:14Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T05:49:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1.

Also, there is the possibility that some profiles might have been deleted as new ones were added, so a full reconstruction would take care of that scenario as well. \r\n\r\nTo evict, as I construct the TreeSet, I simply pop the oldest (by filename) entry. The Guava cache options don't seem to provide a way to define the basis on which to evict entries.\r\n\r\nI believe, @vrozov's work on DRILL-6053 is to address locking during writes specifically. The lock I used (and need) is for reads to ensure that multiple requests don't trigger an expensive FileSystem call for the same state of the PStore. \r\ne.g. consider T# as timestamps\r\n* `currBasePathModified` = T0 \r\n* _ThreadA_ requests at t=T1 and issues a read-lock\r\n* _ThreadB_ requests at t=T2 but is waiting for read-lock\r\n\r\nIf the tree exists and no change is detected, _ThreadA_ will use the `TreeSet` contents and resume by releasing the lock. \r\n\r\nIf the `TreeSet` exists and a change is detected, _ThreadA_ will reconstruct the `TreeSet` before using its contents and it will update `lastBasePathModified`, before releasing the lock.\r\n\r\nWhen _ThreadB_ gets the read-lock, it discovers that during the wait, the `TreeSet` was already updated. So, in terms of t=T2, this is the most recent snapshot, so it proceeds to use the treeSet's contents rather than reconstruct. The reconstruction will be deferred until the next request comes in.\r\n\r\nWe're using the `lastBasePathModified` as a way to provide a pseudo-versioned access to the list. That means if there are more profiles added *after* _ThreadB_ was waiting for the read-lock, it will not trigger the `FileSystem` call right away. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370034791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370084393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/755#issuecomment-370084393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/755","id":370084393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDA4NDM5Mw==","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-02T23:16:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T23:16:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kkhatua\r\n1.

Instead, I added allocate vector method to columnSize in batch sizer, which will use internal sizing information it has to allocate memory (including all it's children) for a particular record count. \r\nRefactored the batch sizer code, added unit tests for verifying sizing and allocation for different vector types. \r\nPlease take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370162678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370166686","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1011#issuecomment-370166686","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1011","id":370166686,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDE2NjY4Ng==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-03T17:53:48Z","updated_at":"2018-03-03T17:54:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers when unit running tests with mapr profile, they fail because this commit brings banned dependency:\r\n`[INFO] --- maven-enforcer-plugin:1.3.1:enforce (avoid_bad_dependencies) @ drill-java-exec ---\r\n[WARNING] Rule 0: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.BannedDependencies failed with message:\r\nFound Banned Dependency: org.json:json:jar:20080701\r\nUse 'mvn dependency:tree' to locate the source of the banned dependencies.`\r\n\r\nPlease use `mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.json:json -Pmapr` to see the results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370166686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
