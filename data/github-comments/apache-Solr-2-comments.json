I.e. for a 3-replica collection you go yellow when losing one replica and orange when only 1/3 is left. And OPS people who are easily scared can always setup warn alarms for situations where YELLOW state persists for several minutes. For a 2-replica collection, you could argue that losing 50% of the replicas and having only one left warrants orange since you're down with only one failure. Setting orange 1-50% and yellow 51-99% would account for that?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/833316061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/833363140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/73#issuecomment-833363140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/73","id":833363140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzM2MzE0MA==","user":{"login":"sigram","id":316377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/316377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram","html_url":"https://github.com/sigram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T09:05:06Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T09:05:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@janhoy the 1-50 and 51-99 thresholds make sense to me.
