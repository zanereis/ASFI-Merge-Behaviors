cache management is very hard, and it is very easy to create a situation in which cached entries on different machines are inconsistent with each other or the new ground truth. Also, the Java code does address some, but not all of the issues at hand.\n\nA couple of ideas:\n1. Maybe we need a push-based protocol from the name server to the resolvers. That way, cache invalidations could be systems-controlled instead of application controlled.\n2. When resolving a name, one gets the last state the evaluator-side resolver has. If the communication doesn't work, application code has to query again to see whether something changed.\n\nMuch of that second item could be hidden in the group communications library. Application code wouldn't have to think about this.\n\n@bgchun Can you help us out here? What are some of the concerns with distributed caching we need to pay attention to?

this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/123003583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/123039357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/291#issuecomment-123039357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/291","id":123039357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzAzOTM1Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-20T21:07:11Z","updated_at":"2015-07-20T21:07:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[REEF-pull-request-windows3

There are two main design choices you can do. Sometimes, people use both of them. \nIf you expect that the scale is not large and there is little change, the first may be reasonable. But as soon as you have changes to update, you have to broadcast the changes to the clients even though the changes are not used at the client. This design has a scalability concern. So, typically, changes are propagated through a scalable pub-sub system. This's not the design choice I had in mind for `NetworkService`.\nThe second one incurs additional latency when the mapping between id and address becomes stale, but it's easier to get scalable in our setting (`Driver` runs an instance for serving name lookups). This's the design I had in mind initially. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/124285575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
