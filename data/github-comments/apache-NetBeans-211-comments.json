Maven process is executed and NetBeans receives its output\r\n2. A set of handlers process the output line-by-line and react to that\r\n3. The output might contain ansi escape sequences if maven either thinks it is talking to a real terminal or is forced to to so (the color flag)\r\n4.

I ran `cmd` inside a the NetBeans terminal emulator at least once, so the terminal emulator of NetBeans is enough to support the output of `cmd`, `powershell` needs another test. I suspect the hard part is to see, that the features the NB Terminal emulator provides with `bash` also work with `cmd` (launching with a working directory, receiving title updates).\r\n\r\n#5552 just says, that it is not consistent across OutputWindow users and sometimes ansi escape sequences don't work, but my screenshot shows, that it works. My take on that is, that the problem is the sending side, that might detect, that it is not talking to a `tty` and thus falls back to not sending ansi sequences.\r\n\r\n#6210 is not a duplicate, but asks for color support by default, different problem and using `color` parameter explicitly overruled by author.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2156800645/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2156801210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7407#issuecomment-2156801210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7407","id":2156801210,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Ajiy6","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-09T21:39:24Z","updated_at":"2024-06-09T21:39:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As this is minimal invasive and the \"drop everything below JEE8 PR did not come\"-PR is not there, lets fix the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2156801210/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2156804453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7441#issuecomment-2156804453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7441","id":2156804453,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Ajjll","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-09T21:49:22Z","updated_at":"2024-06-09T21:50:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I know that the current output can render some decorations, this causes several problems.

Besides it would require to share my cache - I don't know if it would help, but who knows. So, I can't provide test code to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\nSaying `refactor heavily used code` I mean the following. Consider my situation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject A\r\n - jpms module API\r\n + 2 jpms modules\r\n\r\nproject B (5 jpms modules and they use API module from project A)\r\nproject C (8 jpms modules and they use API module from project A).\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I need to refactor some interfaces in API module of project A. For example to split one interface into two. The probability that I will have to clear the cache again after such a refactoring is very high.\r\n\r\nSo, I see the following variants:\r\n\r\n1. This issue is closed and forgotten.\r\n2. Provide any tools in NB that I could use to detect bug. Because IDE log doesn't show any errors.\r\n3. This issue is resolved as NO test code IS REQUIRED to do it. Because this issue is about a new feature, for example project -> right click -> rebuild cache. The same task is executed when NB starts after installation or on the first opening the project. \r\n\r\nI vote for variant 3.

Though if there's ever a chance of the script becoming part of the official build process, then leaving it in this repo would make the git history cleaner.\r\n\r\nPotential future changes that might be relevant to whether the script might eventually become a part of the build process:\r\n* Perhaps we decide that it's better to copy in the SVGs at build time, to avoid having lots of of duplicate SVGs committed in the repo? Or perhaps not; there were other ideas floated before that did not involve a build step, such as having a centralized icon substitution mechanism in ImageUtilities.\r\n* Perhaps we revisit the idea of generating PNGs of different resolutions (e.g. someicon@2x.png, someicon@1.5x.png) from the SVGs at build time instead of relying on the rather heavyweight NetBeans SVG loader. There are some use cases where SVGs won't load automatically, such as in image tags in a Swing HTML caption of a JLabel, or in image loading code generated by the NetBeans form builder.\r\n\r\nHappy to open a PR against netbeans-tools instead if you think that's the best place for these files.

String templates were API+language and implemented in `java.base` and `jdk.compiler`. So even when we would create a frankenstein nb-javac and partially revert https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/18688 it would create problems. \r\nWe also don't know how the next version of string templates will look like or when it will arrive - as soon it is available it would break the JDK 21 templates anyway.
