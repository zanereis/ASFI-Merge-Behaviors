realized that the relationship between the LSO and the high watermark is trickier than I originally thought. I had assumed that it was sufficient to take the minimum of the two as the maximum offset that a client could fetch in READ_COMMITTED mode. The issue is when the COMMIT or ABORT marker itself is larger than the high watermark. We need to ensure that none of the records from the associated transaction becomes readable until the marker itself is replicated (even if the records have offsets lower than the high watermark). This requires a little more bookkeeping as we need to keep track of which transactions have been completed, but are not replicated. I'll update the patch as soon as I have a solution ready.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/297201690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/297204350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2816#issuecomment-297204350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2816","id":297204350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzIwNDM1MA==","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T00:36:01Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T00:36:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR passed the system tests after rebasing:\r\nhttps://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder-2/274/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/297204350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/297206433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2907#issuecomment-297206433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2907","id":297206433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzIwNjQzMw==","user":{"login":"huxihx","id":11549429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ5NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11549429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx","html_url":"https://github.com/huxihx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T00:51:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T00:51:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma Could you kindly take some time to review this PR.

If the Transaction is in ERROR state, the next transactional method will fail.\r\n4. The transaction can be in error state if any transactional request or produce request within the transaction had a fatal error.\r\n\r\nThe only thing remaining is to cache errors from background requests like `AddPartitions` and `FindCoordinator` and propagate those on the next user-facing method.
