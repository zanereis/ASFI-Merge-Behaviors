Also, did you try running the gremlin server integration tests? those are very important to ensure that nothing breaks in this change. You just run:\n\n``` text\nmvn clean install && mvn verify -pl gremlin-server -DskipIntegrationTests\n```\n\nFinally, can you please give an example of not configuring the hosts correctly?

All the old tests still pass don't they? Am I missing where you modified/removed the tests that check for appropriate id semantics?\n\nPerhaps the id magic is bad - it's already not perfect as you saw from Daniel above - this issue details some of the problems with getting TinkerGraph completely compliant:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1048\n\nMaybe there's a better way to get the id semantics tests to pass than what i'm doing in the `HasContainer`.  I just don't know what it is offhand.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/197869261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/197874632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/260#issuecomment-197874632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/260","id":197874632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Nzg3NDYzMg==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T13:14:54Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T13:14:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/197874632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/197876046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/266#issuecomment-197876046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/266","id":197876046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Nzg3NjA0Ng==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T13:19:11Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T13:19:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE: +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/197876046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/197886964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/267#issuecomment-197886964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/267","id":197886964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Nzg4Njk2NA==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-17T13:50:25Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T13:50:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> so -
