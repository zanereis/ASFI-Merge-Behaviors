like the idea. It could allow for interesting configurations. Here are some thoughts I had:\r\n\r\n1. `replicator` - This would work trivially for _replicator jobs because they are not tied a particular replicator document and placement is based on hashing source, target and a few other parameters. There just getting the replicator node set would be good enough. However things become more complicated for replications backed by a replicator db. Currently ownership (placement) of a replication job is determined by where the replicator doc shards live, such that state updates (completed, failed etc) happen as local doc writes. If some nodes can accept document writes but not be replicator nodes, would mean that some replications would never be able to run. We could fix it in a couple of ways:\r\n\r\n  - Allow non-local doc IO. So let replicator doc updates / reads happen remotely and distribute replication jobs based on a replication ID instead of document ID. Then only the replicator nodes would run replications. But with remove doc IO this would introduce new failure modes.\r\n\r\n - `_replicator` db shards placement is customized such that _replicator docs end up only on replicator nodes. This might work but not sure what would happen when replicator node set changes (a node stops being a replicator node). Then might need to do auto-migration of replicator shards\r\n\r\n2. `coordinator` vs `storage`. This would be great to have. Maybe the coordinator ones could have more CPU but less memory or other such hardware customizations. \r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to think about what happens during membership changes. That is in the period of time during and immediately after a node changes its membership. A bit like the case with a replicator above. But say if a node becomes a storage node, then stops being a storage node. Does all data it stored auto-migrate to other storage nodes and what happens during that transition. That would be great to have, and it would open the door to auto-resharding (but that's for a different discussion).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/393693038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/393783475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1335#issuecomment-393783475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1335","id":393783475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzc4MzQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"taicao88","id":39483774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDgzNzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39483774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88","html_url":"https://github.com/taicao88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taicao88/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T07:03:25Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T07:03:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Dear Wohali, \r\n\r\nHow to get the same below\r\n\r\n\"httpd\": {\r\n  \"requests\": {\r\n    \"description\": \"number of HTTP requests\",\r\n    \"current\": 191458567.0,\r\n    \"sum\": 191458567.0,\r\n    \"mean\": 71.150999999999996248,\r\n    \"stddev\": 102.38500000000000512,\r\n    \"min\": 0,\r\n    \"max\": 1197\r\n  }\r\n}","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/393783475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/393945122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1335#issuecomment-393945122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1335","id":393945122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk0NTEyMg==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T17:04:56Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T17:04:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"current and sum are the same.

The current printf style is efficient in this respect.\r\n- The reason I'm worried about the above is that a future JSON formatter won't be happy receiving aribtrary Erlang terms, so I was trying to figure out the right place to transform them. Doing it at the point of the logging invocation runs the risk of wasted effort if the log level is set higher.\r\n- We exhumed `lager` from the codebase a few years ago. Why? Was it simply that we thought it was a lot of unnecessary code?\r\n- Erlang 21 adds a new logger inspired by lager: http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-10.0-rc1/lib/kernel-6.0/doc/html/logger_chapter.html. The new Erlang logger does allow for maps and/or key-value lists to be logged directly.\r\n- The legacy error_logger also has the concept of a `report` which is a list of atoms and 2-tuples. A `report` is not necessarily JSON-compatible because each value is an arbitrary term.\r\n\r\nLazy evaluation could be as simple as wrapping every log invocation in a `fun() -> ... end` and only invoking the function once we've checked the log level. That should be efficient and cheap, but probably means reverting to macros instead of direct M:F/A calls ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/394924878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/395173064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1310#issuecomment-395173064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1310","id":395173064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTE3MzA2NA==","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T18:44:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T18:44:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ahh, I probably was thinking one vs multi line and wasn't considering how the ~w format doesn't pretty print strings.\r\n\r\n+1 to switching to ~p","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/395173064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/395196897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1376#issuecomment-395196897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1376","id":395196897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTE5Njg5Nw==","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T20:07:44Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T20:07:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, it seems like normalize_sort_fields and all of the mayb_filter_sort_fields logic should actually be inside each index's implementation module.

The latter group has some efficiency advantages but fundamentally an external process could go and do everything that the internal consumers do using the node-local HTTP interface. The lack of HTTP access to the purge index breaks that. An external indexer, for example, has no way of knowing revisions have been purged from the main database short of checking the individual shard's purge sequence and rebuilding the entire index if it changes, whereas the internal consumers can be smarter.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I wouldn't change anything about this PR, as it contains everything needed to surface an external API to the purge structures if we should conclude there's a need for it at a later date.\r\n\r\nI'm +1 pending resolution of my (minor) review comments.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/397138672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/397160730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1385#issuecomment-397160730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1385","id":397160730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzE2MDczMA==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T03:42:28Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T03:42:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @seigel , we've got a [PR coming with improved documentation on this](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/pull/268) from @garbados.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: If your new node comes back *as Node 3*, with the same hostname, it will automatically get all of those shards re-replicated to it. This is the recommended approach, especially in AWS where transparently replacing a machine is easy. You just need to have your own DNS set up for these machines - don't use the AWS internal host names, because those are predicated on internal IP addresses you can't control. You really want host names like `node#.clustername.yourdomain.com`.\r\n\r\nFor `q=9, n=3` you have 27 shards total, 9 per machine. Databases in CouchDB are \"presharded,\" meaning that the shard map is fixed. Adding a fourth machine (without removing any machines on the network) will not result in any of those shards moving to the new machine to balance the load.\r\n\r\nThere is a way to bring your new node back as node 4, add it to the cluster membership, and edit the shard map to ensure that a given database is supposed to have shards on that node. You can pre-seed those shards by copying them from other machines, or you can let Couch do all the work. Both approaches are discussed in the PR that has yet to land.\r\n\r\nHope this help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/397160730/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/397192307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1314#issuecomment-397192307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1314","id":397192307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzE5MjMwNw==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T06:59:16Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T06:59:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The new packages are ready and will be uploaded soon -
