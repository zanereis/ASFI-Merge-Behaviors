It is a feature of HTTP.  HTTP/1.1 is not a streaming protocol. HTTP/2 is much better but it must be used in the right way - overlaying HTTP/1.1 does not expose the two-flow of data in HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in HTTP/1.1, the client can close the TCP connection and open a new one. It messes up connection polling. TCP connections are expensive. There are client-wide and server-wide problems that arise. We know, it's happened. Jena's own test suite used to have these issues.\r\n\r\nClosing the connection does not cause the client to clear-up at the point of close, nor does the server see a close to clear-up a that moment..  On unloaded machines, it can take 2 minutes; under load the Linux kernel delays reclaim close-waiting connections (it's a GC like task). \r\n\r\nThe effect is either end can run out of file descriptors. \r\n\r\nIn HTTP/2, the situation is both better and worse. Better because there is access to the chunking and flow of chunks but that is only if HTTP/2 specific code is written. Worse because there is only a single TCP connection per host pair which has multiple outstanding requests in-flight and can't be closed. It can lead to head-of-line blocking.\r\n\r\nSee javadoc for `BodySubscribers#ofInputStream()`\r\n\r\nJena needs reliability before performance. And it is the corner cases, not the main/normal usage.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1067876323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1067937613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1218#issuecomment-1067937613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1218","id":1067937613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec4_p29N","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-15T12:35:35Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T12:35:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I started looking into this after all - so please don't (re)review the latest changes yet.\r\n\r\n> What is your suggestion?\r\n\r\nIf this is ready now, I will review and make a proposal.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if discussions seems very cautious but this is a key feature of the Jena.

Without your feedback it doesn't make sense for me to add more tests for features which might be at risk anyway depending on your verdict.\r\n\r\n> I'm sorry if discussions seems very cautious but this is a key feature of the Jena.\r\n\r\nNo worries, I tried to break the architecture down into simple and reasonable components so that all the current concerns and maybe future ones can hopefully be quickly addressed.\r\n\r\nAs for the mentioned issue with `AbstractResultSetTests`: The default behavior of HttpClient is to consume the remaining input when .close() is called in its input stream. Under this perspective the warning is redundant because in this case it is expected behavior. I don't think that any special logic would belong to `RowSetJSONStreaming`. I would suspect that the same warnings would be displayed when streaming xml.\r\n\r\nNeeds more thought how to handle this properly - maybe QueryExecHttp should have a `warnOnRemainingData` option whose value is the number of bytes this class should read before issuing a warning and calling close on the HttpClient-backed InputStream; which may then either consume the remaining data or cut the connection. Closing a query execution early due to a processing error is not so uncommon.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1067979907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1070984517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1218#issuecomment-1070984517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1218","id":1070984517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec4_1e1F","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-17T15:30:17Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:30:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://www.overops.com/blog/the-ultimate-json-library-json-simple-vs-gson-vs-jackson-vs-json/\r\n\r\nNot that raw speed is likely to be the limiting factor streaming at scale (writing is usually slower than reading) but in the 2021 update at the link above, GSON is faster for small and large files.\r\n\r\nYMMV.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1070984517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1071056504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1218#issuecomment-1071056504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1218","id":1071056504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec4_1wZ4","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-17T16:32:43Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T17:12:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note that in the PR, the `RowSetJSONStreaming` implementation (which does accumulation and validation) is independent of gson.

Often, the application code is a long way away from the reader so details of the format are not understood by the application. In Fuseki, they are logged. Error handling and especially \"warning\", overlaps with logging. Even this \"client\" side code would do the same for federated queries.\r\n\r\nIn the parsers, errors generate exceptions so they are not recoverable; there are possibly occasionally exceptions to this, sometimes recovery is possible but the output should now be considered \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this isn't a free choice. A warning is something the code notes but will continue to process, an error is serious enough that the results are suspect at best. Turing error into warning changes the contract.\r\n\r\nIn RowSetReaderStream, a situation like \"Encountered bindings as well as boolean result\" is an error. The incoming results JSON is illegal. The fault is at the server end. Any fixup is a decision as to which header to believe and is throwing the other choice away.\r\n\r\nAll the calls to `ErrorHandlers.relay` are serious errors, except, arguably, finding extra elements in the JSON which the reader doesn't understand. (e.g. JSON \"comments\"!!)\r\n\r\nI tried to refactor to centralize error handling so the the processing code call \"error(details)\"  but it became too big a change.\r\n\r\nI think allowing for fine-grained handling would benefit from an explicit error record of an enum \"error kind\", it's classification \"error\"/\"warning\" and the specific message. ValidationSettings enumerates the possible errors as statics.\r\n\r\nThe enum can be used to process the error which as looking up into a table of what is currently called Severity.

Your reply is helpful to me.\r\n\r\nI want to use **Fuseki** to store RDF data, possibly **update in real time**, and open up **SPARQL Endpoint** to outside.\r\n\r\nI was also going to use **Jena's Java APIs** , but I found that it can't be accessed by multiple applications at the same time and has no SPARQL Endpoint, which is why I didn't choose TDB directly. As [TDB](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/index.html) says:\r\n```\r\nIf you wish to share a TDB dataset between multiple applications please use our Fuseki component which provides a SPARQL server that can use TDB for persistent storage and provides the SPARQL protocols for query, update and REST update over HTTP.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter your reply, I learned that I had to update Fuseki through SPARQL, but this would involve a lot of escape problems in the text, and it would be complicated to write the code. At the same time, HTTP would also increase the performance overhead.  \r\n\r\nI wonder if I missed something about Jena?\r\n\r\nBest Regards","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1084934478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1084958600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1243#issuecomment-1084958600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1243","id":1084958600,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5AqyeI","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-31T18:30:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T18:30:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Shall we turn this into a GitHub \"discussion\" because it is not an actionable issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1084958600/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1085340522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1243#issuecomment-1085340522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1243","id":1085340522,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5AsPtq","user":{"login":"chenkuncloud","id":40781280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzgxMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40781280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud","html_url":"https://github.com/chenkuncloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenkuncloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-01T02:24:24Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T02:24:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your reminding, I have moved to the DISCUSSIONS #1246 .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1085340522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1085541236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1243#issuecomment-1085541236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1243","id":1085541236,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5AtAt0","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-01T07:42:31Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T07:42:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have only recently enables the GH issues and discussions features so we're getting used to how best to use them.

One way is to squash done to one/a few commits on the PR, then I can pick it up, apply the diff for a new PR, then merge that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1090146623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1092077229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1218#issuecomment-1092077229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1218","id":1092077229,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5BF8at","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-07T18:35:20Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T18:37:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The last couple of weeks were so busy -

The 1.0 algorithm has been updated to only consider terms that map to a value that ends with a URI [gen-delim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2) character.\r\n\r\nThe operative step is Step 10 in the [Create Term Definition Algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#algorithm-0)\r\n\r\n> Create a new [term definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#dfn-term-definition), definition, initializing [prefix flag](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#dfn-prefix-flag) to false, [protected](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#dfn-protected) to protected, and [reverse property](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#dfn-reverse-property) to false.\r\n\r\nAnd step 14.2.5:\r\n\r\n> If term contains neither a colon (:) nor a slash (/), simple term is true, and if the [IRI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-2) mapping of definition is either an IRI ending with a [gen-delim](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2) character, or a [blank node

I was just confused by the different behaviour of Jena 4.1.0 vs the latest versions, and then I remembered that you changed the used HTTP API. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/blazegraph/database/blob/master/bigdata-core/bigdata-sails/src/java/com/bigdata/rdf/sail/webapp/QueryServlet.java#L921\r\n\r\n```java\r\n static private String getQueryString(final HttpServletRequest req)\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n        if (RESTServlet.hasMimeType(req, MIME_SPARQL_QUERY)) {\r\n            // return the body of the POST, see trac 711\r\n            return readFully(req.getReader());\r\n        }\r\n        return req.getParameter(ATTR_QUERY) != null ? req\r\n                .getParameter(ATTR_QUERY) : (String) req\r\n                .getAttribute(ATTR_QUERY);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately they rely on the old HTTP API and the `HttpServletRequest` sticks to `ISO-8859-` by default if in the HTTP request no encoding is specified - and you can't change the default encoding afaik. The only fix would be to set the encoding on the request object, i.e.  \r\n```java\r\nreq.setCharacterEncoding(\"UTF-8\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo not sure how to continue, we'll raise an issue on Blazegraph, but I don't think that fix will even make it to Wikidata setup as they would have to rebuild and redeploy Blazegraph.\r\n\r\nOr they would set the default encoding in their Jetty server if possible.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nRegarding POST Form, via `curl` it works:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X POST --data \"query=SELECT ?x { BIND('Curaçao' As ?x) }\" https://query.wikidata.org/sparql\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor Jena I guess we can close this issue (once you got an idea on the POST form issue you mentioned) here and at least have it for reference and documentation as a known limitation. Might affect other users as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1103643711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1103846006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1259#issuecomment-1103846006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1259","id":1103846006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5By1p2","user":{"login":"LorenzBuehmann","id":976029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/976029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann","html_url":"https://github.com/LorenzBuehmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LorenzBuehmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-20T11:55:21Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T11:55:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@afs

That's a somewhat large example.\r\n> \r\n> What part of SPARQ target is different between Apache Jena and Topquadrant SHACL?\r\n\r\nHi, \r\n\r\nThe shacl-rules-graph and the data-graph are identical for both approaches, the difference only in behavior.\r\nHere is the concrete difference:\r\n```java\r\n    private static Model runJenaShaclRules(Model dataModel, Model rules) {\r\n        ValidationReport res = ShaclValidator.get().validate(rules.getGraph(), dataModel.getGraph());\r\n        return res.getModel();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static Model runTopbraidShaclRules(Model dataModel, Model shapesModel) {\r\n        Resource report = org.topbraid.shacl.validation.ValidationUtil.validateModel(dataModel, shapesModel, false);\r\n        return report.getModel();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnother way to reproduce: download and run `simple-shack-for-test.ttl`. It contains all rules and data. For Topquadrant SHACL implementation, Topbraid Composer can be used.\r\n\r\n__________\r\nIt seems Jena fails to handle property predicate `$custom`, which is pointed as `sh:NodeShape ex:custom rdfs:subClassOf`.\r\nEverything works fine If we replace it with `sh:NodeShape sh:select [ a sh:SPARQLConstraint ... ]` where there is no parameter in sparql-body.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1104797169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1105681624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1259#issuecomment-1105681624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1259","id":1105681624,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5B51zY","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-21T19:40:37Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T19:40:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Separate issue and PR please!\r\n\r\nWith error handling.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1105681624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1105683615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1259#issuecomment-1105683615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1259","id":1105683615,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5B52Sf","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-21T19:43:03Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T09:40:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We might as well put back the \"charset=utf8\".
