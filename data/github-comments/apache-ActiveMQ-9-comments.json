I verified the sizing and the reported frame sizes when checked on the client side vs server are now quite close (not exact but it's close enough)\r\n\r\nI see a few things to change:\r\n\r\n1. There needs to be tests for all the transports. You need to also test the normal transports (TCP, SSL, etc) and not just NIO.\r\n2. the nio and nio+ssl transports actually check the frame size in a different location on the server than the OpenWireFormat so the NIOSSLTransport and NIOTransport should be updated to also check the new flag. See: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/main/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/nio/NIOSSLTransport.java#L338 and https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/main/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/nio/NIOTransport.java#L142\r\n3. I would change the isAssignableFrom() to an instanceof check as it's slightly fast (see the inline comment)\r\n4. You should write edge case tests. For example, we should test all 3 scenarios: frame size is enabled on both client/server, frame size is only enabled on the server and frame size is only enabled on the client.  If enabled on the client then we should make sure the connection stays open and if it's a server side only check then the connection should be closed.\r\n5. You should write a test to verify that the framesize flag is not negotiated over open wire to prevent errors in the future or someone changing it. Ie make sure that if either side changes the flag the other side doesn't have it's flag changed.\r\n6. Documentation needs to be added both to the code and to the website that makes it very clear that the flag won't be negotiated and only applies where it is set. https://activemq.apache.org/configuring-wire-formats\r\n7. I think we can probably just rename the flag `verifyMaxFrameSizeEnabled `to just `maxFrameSizeEnabled` . Your comment for the PR also has the wrong name.\r\n8. ~~Lastly I don't think this should be added to 5.16.4 due to it being a change in behavior and a feature. Point releases should really just be about bug fixes and this definitely changes the expected behavior a bit. I think we should only put this into 5.17.0. The flag applies to client/server so we can't put it into 5.16.4 and by default turn it off easily so that's why I think just 5.17.0~~ I changed my mind, I think it's ok in 5.16.4 and likely a nice improvement. The behavior doesn't actually change on the client side since a JMSException is thrown either way (and the cause is an IOException still whether it's server or client side check if you make the change to include the MaxFrameSizeException as the cause). So the client gets the same exception type so it isn't really a breaking change. And it's better as the server doesn't have to deal with it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1030864498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1030891345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/755#issuecomment-1030891345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/755","id":1030891345,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM849cidR","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-06T18:50:15Z","updated_at":"2022-02-06T18:50:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lucastetreault appreciate the PR work here =).

I am not sure I understand. This is a Redis storage layer, not LevelDB. Are you saying that Redis is of no interest as a storage layer? We have a requirement for scheduled messages to be replicated across regions for DR purposes. KahaDB doesn't seem to support this. Redis has replication, thus I implemented the persistence.  If this is of no interest, I'll just build a separate internal artifact and this does not need to become a contribution.
