I will explain my reasoning behind these changes and then answer your questions. \r\n\r\n## The Goal\r\nMy primary goal is to improve the continuous deployment process for Pulsar environments operating at-scale. In large projects where multiple teams are collaborating to develop functions, sinks, and sources, we need an automated deployment process that allows us to quickly and easily update a production Pulsar environment without downtime for cases where we may have hundreds or thousands of inter-dependent Pulsar functions, sinks, and sources that need to be deployed simultaneously. My hope is to allow Pulsar to handle more of the deployment logic to simplify the implementation of Pulsar in large/high-performance production environments. \r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nBecause our pulsar-admin commands are dockerized to allow them to operate at scale, there is performance overhead with every pulsar-admin command that must be executed. Each pulsar-admin command takes approximately 3-5 seconds to execute. In a deployment with 300 Pulsar functions, if each pulsar-admin command must be executed in series (rather than in parallel), executing 300 pulsar-admin commands to update these objects takes 15-25 minutes. Because Pulsar is in a broken state while these commands are being executed, this deployment approach could result in a production Pulsar environment being down for 15-25 minutes, far beyond our SLA of 300 milliseconds of downtime. Furthermore, if we need to execute a get-status check before each update command (so that we can conditionally execute a create command instead), we double our wait time and significantly increase the complexity of the deployment code that we must maintain.  \r\n\r\n## The Hope\r\nIf we can offload more of the deployment logic to Pulsar, then we could easily parallelize the deployment process in a way that avoids the overhead and complexity associated with repeatedly executing pulsar admin commands and handling the text output. \r\n\r\n## The Current Approach\r\nThe way we have handled the deployment so far is to use SaltStack to read a YAML manifest file with component (function, sink, and source) metadata to generate pulsar-admin commands to construct the create statements for these components. Here is an obfuscated example of this YAML:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- type: source\r\n    namespace: ns1\r\n    tenant: tenant1\r\n    name: source1-kafka\r\n    sourceType: kafka\r\n    destinationTopicName: persistent://tenant1/ns1/topic1\r\n    configs:\r\n        bootstrapServers: kafka_bootstrap_servers\r\n        groupId: \"kafkaGroupId\"\r\n        topic: \"kafkaTopic\"\r\n        consumerConfigProperties:\r\n        security.protocol: \"SASL_PLAINTEXT\"\r\n        sasl.kerberos.service.name: \"kafka\"\r\n        auto.offset.reset: \"latest\"\r\n        sasl.jaas.config: sasl_jaas_config\r\n- type: function\r\n    namespace: ns1\r\n    name: func1\r\n    tenant: tenant1\r\n    artifactFileName: tenant1-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n    className: com.path.to.className1\r\n    inputs:\r\n    - persistent://tenant1/ns1/topic1\r\n    logTopic: persistent://tenant1/ns1/logTopic1\r\n    output: persistent://tenant1/ns1/topic2\r\n- type: sink\r\n    namespace: ns1\r\n    name: sink1-redis\r\n    tenant: tenant1\r\n    artifactFileName: tenant1-1.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n    className: com.path.to.className2\r\n    inputs:\r\n    - persistent://tenant1/ns1/topic2\r\n    configs:\r\n        hostname: redis_hostname\r\n        port: redis_port\r\n        password: redis_pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Idea\r\nIf we could pass a YAML file like this to Pulsar and have Pulsar ensure that its state matches our YAML file, it would make large-scale continuous deployments seamless. The Upsert functionality is one step in this direction, but it's not anywhere near as important as a bigger-picture solution to this problem. My team wants to build changes into Pulsar to simplify deployments, but we need architectural guidance about where to make these changes in Pulsar so that we don't violate architectural expectations.  \r\n\r\n## Answering your questions\r\n### Regarding your Question 1:\r\nMy current understanding is that the Admin CLI creates REST calls that hit the Pulsar REST API. If my understanding of the behavior of the Admin CLI is incorrect, then Upsert would not need to be added to the REST API. \r\n### Regarding your Question 2: \r\nI agree that it would be better to use the existing APIs and not modify FunctionRuntimeManager and FunctionMetaDataManager, especially because the current PR introduces a considerable amount of code duplication. However, I didn't want to create new classes to handle the new functionality without getting architectural guidance because I wasn't sure where to put the new classes. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? If we can solve the broader deployment problem with a YAML based approach, then we could create a robust solution that wouldn't need Upsert to be added to the REST API to simplify the deployment process.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481472762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481475499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3958#issuecomment-481475499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3958","id":481475499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ3NTQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T23:21:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T23:21:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481475499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481475919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3758#issuecomment-481475919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3758","id":481475919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ3NTkxOQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T23:23:25Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T23:23:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run cpp tests\r\nrun java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481475919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481479715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3983#issuecomment-481479715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3983","id":481479715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ3OTcxNQ==","user":{"login":"lovelle","id":7503370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDMzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7503370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle","html_url":"https://github.com/lovelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T23:42:16Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T23:43:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi!

In this particular segment, we find that we are seeking to a time which is in between the third and fourth messsage published. The last five digits of the message publish times are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n83877\r\n84885\r\n85893\r\n86877\r\n86902\r\n87908  \r\n92944 \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we are seeking to a time with last five digits of 86877.  However, the seek turns out to be ineffective. And when ```Reader#readNext()``` returns a value, it still returns the first value instead. @sijie  Do you know what might explain this puzzling behavior? \r\n\r\nBTW, the test result is the following:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] testReaderAtSelectedTimestamp(org.apache.pulsar.client.api.TopicReaderTest)  Time elapsed: 10.171 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Received message my-message-0 did not match the expected message my-message-3 expected [my-message-3] but found [my-message-0]\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.fail(Assert.java:96)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:776)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.assertEqualsImpl(Assert.java:137)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481514423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481527159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4015#issuecomment-481527159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4015","id":481527159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTUyNzE1OQ==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T04:18:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T04:18:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481527159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481530830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3983#issuecomment-481530830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3983","id":481530830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTUzMDgzMA==","user":{"login":"ConcurrencyPractitioner","id":25971966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTcxOTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25971966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner","html_url":"https://github.com/ConcurrencyPractitioner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConcurrencyPractitioner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T04:40:55Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T04:40:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One more thing.

Submitting/Updating functions by just making a HTTP REST call will be a lot faster than start up a docker container every time to execute commands via command line\r\n\r\n> In a deployment with 300 Pulsar functions, if each pulsar-admin command must be executed in series (rather than in parallel), executing 300 pulsar-admin commands to update these objects takes 15-25 minutes.\r\n\r\nDo you have 300 individual functions or is there a function with 300 instances or a group of functions that total 300 instances?  There will be a huge submission time difference depending on which scenario.  Submitting one function with 300 instances will take much less time that submitting 300 functions with one instance each.\r\n\r\n> Because Pulsar is in a broken state while these commands are being executed\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by this?  The cluster will be running as it should when submitting functions.\r\n\r\n> this deployment approach could result in a production Pulsar environment being down for 15-25 minutes, far beyond our SLA of 300 milliseconds of downtime.\r\n\r\nIn a situation, that somehow your whole pulsar cluster is down and all your functions disappeared, it is unrealistic to expect the downtime to be less that 300 milliseconds.  As you probably already know, starting up a pulsar cluster regardless of functions will take longer than that.  If you are just talking about resubmitting 300 functions,  I am not sure its realistic to expect all the JARs/Packages for 300 functions can be upload in 300 milliseconds.  If you are trying to avoid a situation in which you suffer downtime because a catastrophic event happened to your cluster, i would recommend having redundancy.  Have geo-replicated clusters across multiple regions.  So you can seamlessly cut traffic from your downed cluster to another cluster.\r\n\r\nIf you have 300 functions, I don't think its going to be the norm for you to need to update all 300 functions.  Its more likely that its going to be a subset of that.\r\n\r\nI think functionality you are looking is bulk create, update, or upserts.  You want to bring a cluster from a potentially unknown state into a known consistent state in regards to functions.  I am I understanding you correctly?\r\n\r\nWhile we can add upserts and even bulk upserts.  I would suggest you to try just creating/updating functions directly using the REST endpoint first to see if that is good enough.\r\n\r\nI would still very much like to see features like bulk create/update/upserts in Pulsar functions.  I do believe we can accomplish them by just adding/modifying the \"front end\" code i.e. the REST the endpoints and ComponentImpl.java  to implement the bulk actions.  Please reference the code in registerFunction and updateFunction and when can probably just run that in a loop for bulk actions.\r\n\r\nIn regards, to this PR and implementing upserts, I think you can just do something like the following in ComponentImpl.java\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(functionMetaDataManager.containsFunction(tenant, namespace, functionName)) {\r\n   updateFunction(...)\r\n} else {\r\n   registerFunction(...)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe caveat in the above logic is that a function can be deleted after \"containsFunction\" is called. To handle that scenario I would suggest you looking at how the updateFunction code works and basically copy that code and modify it to also allow functions that don't exist to also proceed in the logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481809137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/481811252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4014#issuecomment-481811252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4014","id":481811252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTgxMTI1Mg==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T18:35:36Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T18:35:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun

Submitting/Updating functions by just making a HTTP REST call will be a lot faster . . . \r\n\r\nI appreciate your guidance.

There will be a huge submission time difference depending on which scenario. Submitting one function with 300 instances will take much less time that submitting 300 functions with one instance each.\r\n\r\nAt the current moment, all of our functions are individual because they represent different use cases.

The cluster will be running as it should when submitting functions.\r\n\r\nI may have been unintentionally misleading, and I apologize for that. Please let me clarify. When I said:\r\n>  Pulsar is in a broken state\r\n\r\nI didn't mean that the Pulsar cluster is not running. What I meant is that our end-to-end production message pipelines will be in a broken state.

This doesn't mean that the water system is completely broken or that water is not flowing; however, it means that water is not reaching our customers. \r\nIn our case, if we have a production data flow that is processing tens of thousands of messages per second, if we need to deploy updates to functions that are inter-dependent, then until all of the functions are deployed, some of the functions may introduce breaking changes that could cause data loss or could cause messages to fail to reach the final destination topic until all of the updated functions are deployed. \r\nDoes this make more sense?\r\n\r\nRegarding:\r\n> I think functionality you are looking is bulk create, update, or upserts.

 I'm currently researching technologies for a new employer that has interest in Kafka and a significant existing data science investment in Python.

Admittedly, I am just at the beginning of my investigation, but after recognizing that Pulsar is an actively maintained project that has decomposed the problem it addresses in a way that has enabled it to provide the language support not present in Kafka and noting that it has recently graduated from incubator status, the very next triage-style question I that led me to this very thread was, \"What about DC/OS support?
