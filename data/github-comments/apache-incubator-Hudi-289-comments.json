As of now, you can't disable auto clean and thats a limitation. \r\n\r\nIf you disable auto clean, cleaning is essentially not happening. But archival assumes that cleaning is enabled and makes progress. And it will result in dangling data files where timeline files are archived, but data files are left dangling since the cleaner could not run. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to run cleaner as a separate process, can you disable archival as well w/ regular writer. \r\nI have filed a tracking jira here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5054\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1284352768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1284354065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6900#issuecomment-1284354065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6900","id":1284354065,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5MjbAR","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-19T17:34:39Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T17:34:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"and yes, if you using a diff process to do compaction and cleaning, you need to configure lock provider for sure.

I see `scanPartitions` and `dropPartitions` are the major logic for `RepairTableCommand`. But both of them depends on the partition directories in FileSystem, that is not suitable for Hudi. In Hudi, even if one partition directory exists, this partition still may have been dropped before. So better to use the partition information of the current snapshot instead of directories in FileSystem.
