I have repackage zipkin image with eclipse-temurin ubuntu base image, and it works. I find that more and more libraries running on jvm alpine base image that will have network issues since kubernetes 1.24-1.25 (1.24 in last comment), some components like spring config server, spring config client, some libraries like spring resttemplate, jgit. In my team, since kubernetes being upgraded, almost all projects need to be repackaged from alpine base to non-alpine.\r\nSo, does the openzipkin team consider providing non-alpine base image as an
