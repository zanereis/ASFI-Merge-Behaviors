With small change in the existing updateComparisonPredicate method, we can fix the bug.\r\n\r\n`CalciteSqlParser` doesn't know whether columns `a` and `b` are `STRING`, `INTEGER`, or `BYTES`, or any other datatype, so we can't really rewrite `WHERE a = b` into `WHERE COMPARE(a,b) = 0` when `a` and `b` are `STRING` and to `WHERE MINUS(a,b)=0` when `a` and `b` are numbers. Also, we cannot overload `MINUS` function to work on `STRING` since `ScalarFunction` currently cannot be overloaded (there are several issues already open on this as this has implications on query correctness and type handling but I don't think there is a good solution yet).\r\n\r\n> Basically this is not an optimization, it's fixing a bug in the query rewrite logic.\r\n\r\nTrue, but we also need to keep in mind that `QueryOptimizer` isn't really an optimizer, its a rewriter :-)\r\n\r\n> We don't need to split the rewrite logic in two places. If something changes or a bug surfaces in the rewrite logic, we should only update one place in the code.\r\n\r\nThe rewrite logic is already split into two places (one in `CalciteSqlParser` and other in `QueryOptimizer`). So given the issues, this serves as a good \"fix\" until we do some major refactoring like 1) using Schema and TableConfig information in CalciteSqlParser in which case it should just be merged with `QueryOptimizer` since QueryOptimizer does that already, or 2) fixing the function overloading and type resolution issues with ScalarFunction). I added some comment about this in `StringPredicateFilterOptimizer` and can add more details if needed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/912864460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/912897221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7396#issuecomment-912897221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7396","id":912897221,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c42abTF","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-04T03:05:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-04T03:35:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7396?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7396](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7396?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (ca11780) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/5976922d85ad0de6080b1dd63289b2a70756fa22?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (5976922) will **decrease** coverage by `41.48%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head ca11780 differs from pull request most recent head fbebe44.

degradation\r\n\r\nWe don't know, but the [JIT compiler does](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~vlivanov/talks/2015_JIT_Overview.pdf) - it profiles branches, can remove (untaken branch pruning) and reorder them (branch frequency prediction) and so on. Do you have a schema in mind where this code is slower than the `HashMap` and could you demonstrate it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/914659218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/914665876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7402#issuecomment-914665876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7402","id":914665876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c42hLGU","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T22:21:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T22:21:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought the speedup comes from re-ordering the if checks?
