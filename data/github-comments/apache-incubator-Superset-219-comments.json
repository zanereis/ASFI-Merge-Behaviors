It used query object as key, and cache age is configurable by `CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`. Cached content size is varies from single row up to 50K rows, depends on the user's data. If user configure Superset to use redis as caching backend, cache size is not a concern by now. We don't have to offer a smart algorithm to evict cache (redis or other backend has implementation, probably LRU cache).\r\n\r\nIn #7032 and apache-superset/superset-ui#119, you introduced 2 layers of caching: client-side cache (conditional requests) and server cache. Let's see how it works (as of today in `master` branch):\r\n(The following is just what i learnt by reading code, please correct me if i got it wrong)\r\n\r\n**client-side cache and conditional requests:**\r\n- cache key: request url\r\n- cache age: by `Expire` header, configurable by `CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\r\n- cache size: _by browser_\r\n- eviction policy: _no eviction policy implemented_\r\n\r\n**server-side cache:**\r\n- cache key: request parameter (like full form_data)\r\n- cache age: configurable by `CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\r\n- cache size: by caching backend\r\n- eviction policy: by caching backend\r\n\r\nFirst, using request url as client-side cache key is problematic. For example, user A changed slice_1 by added a filter and saved it. Then User B won't see this change until his browser cache expired. I think #7255 is trying to resolve this issue, but it can not resolve the root cause. In #7255 the issue is exposed by user changing viz_type, so the fix is to add viz_type parameter as client-side cache key. But what if chart's other parameter get updated and saved with same chart id? `viz_type` is one of many chart's saved parameters, i think it's not necessary to make it as client-side cache key.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, what if browser cache is full? My concern is, can this client-side cache scale for many, large dashboard case? \r\n\r\nThere are a few issues in switching between GET and POST methods (I think you probably fix them in #7319 by invalidate client-cache?):\r\n- update dashboard filter will trigger POST requests, and no client-side cache for the results\r\n- force refresh chart will trigger POST request, and client-side cache is not updated to refreshed data.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I have some concerns on security:\r\n- Superset used POST method for query, which will have csrf protection from FAB. If using GET request method, we don't have this protection anymore. You can argue that why do we need this layer of protection, but airbnb internally already request us to DISABLE GET method for query request.\r\n- GET method may expose all query parameters in request url, which may includes PII sensitive data, and further get logged by monitor system. We had a similar issue in query search page, #7234. We exposed query parameters in query search page. Expose sensitive data in log may not as apparent as showing in web page, but it could cause more damage because the log may save for a very long time, and it may contains a lot data.\r\n- Generally speaking, store query results (may have PII data) in client-side is bad practice. It may not as dangerous as store user creditcard or other credentials, but localStorage or browser cache is still vulnerable to XSS attacks and that the data can be viewed by scripts on the page.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485604321/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485610284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6610#issuecomment-485610284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6610","id":485610284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTYxMDI4NA==","user":{"login":"coderfender","id":11091419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDkxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11091419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender","html_url":"https://github.com/coderfender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderfender/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-23T01:41:27Z","updated_at":"2019-04-23T01:42:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @cgivre ..

The issue is around the fact that the `formData` may need to get sanitized by frontend-related logic.\r\n\r\nThe bug or symptom is the \"Genders by State\" example started showing an extra (3rd) metric (`sum__num`) on top of `Boys` and `Girls`.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot going on related to this, but a key point here is that we have control-related logic like `default` and things around control panel that sanitizes `formData`. In that particular case, the example's form data is malformed with both `metrics` and `metric`. In the explore view, or in a normal POST request, the formData gets sanitized:\r\n* missing keys get filled with the control's default\r\n* extra keys get deleted\r\n* more stuff\r\n\r\nNow another thing that compounds here is that `viz.py` blindly looks at all METRIC_KEYS to help craft the query_obj. So the combo of these things create the issue:\r\n* example is malformed, it should have only `metrics` and NO `metric` key (easy to fix)\r\n* in GET mode, the formData does not get \"sanitized\" by the frontend\r\n* viz.py could be more prescriptive about the metrics it builds into the query object\r\n\r\nNow it's pretty clear that addressing any of these 3 things would fix my symptom, but point 2 on its own is worrisome. It can lead to intricate issues over time. Say I save a chart, and after that I add a new control to that vizType, in the context of the `GET`, it won't get the right default.\r\n\r\nGood news is I'm working on a refactor https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7350 to help and clean up all of the control / formData processing logic. It grew out of control over time. Now the assumption is that all request would make it through this logic, and I'm realizing that's not the case, at least since this PR.\r\n\r\nIdeas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485943905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485953579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7358#issuecomment-485953579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7358","id":485953579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTk1MzU3OQ==","user":{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-23T20:04:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-23T20:04:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I was looking at the code, and we **do** limit the objects returned, but only if a substring is passed: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7358/files#diff-ac978615a4f22c4fad4d01f39e1d4595R1539\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should also limit it when no substring is passed? Your approach is nice because it's more usable: if we're going to limit the number of tables we might as well limit to the most important schemas, instead of returning a random subset.
