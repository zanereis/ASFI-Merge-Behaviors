```js\r\n> type: 'line3D'\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n\r\nDear all, \r\n\r\nHi~ I have met the same problem, actully.\r\n\r\nMy question could be condensed as follow:\r\n1.  If I have a dataset of lots of 3D data, such  [x, y, z], and I want to show all of them in 'surface', it seems it is not easy to be realized, have I missed sth?  I thought my setting on 3D space, is fine. So I strongly doubt the format of input data has some special things.\r\n2.  I read the so-called help file, it told me that X in [x, y, z] has to be in a order from small to big, I follow such rule, and I failed again.\r\n3. I read the several online and succcessful cases supplied, seems, x and y in  [x, y, z], have to be located strictly to the grid? however, my data from nature measurement , it could be follow some so-called step ,e.g., 0.5 or 0.005.\r\n Pls give some clue to me, why part I need to read again? Thanks for that！ \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/528267721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/528271837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11175#issuecomment-528271837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11175","id":528271837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODI3MTgzNw==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T09:03:04Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T09:03:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!
