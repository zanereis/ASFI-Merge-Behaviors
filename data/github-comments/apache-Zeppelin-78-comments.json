non-mentioned?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236820725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236825452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1251#issuecomment-236825452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1251","id":236825452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjgyNTQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T07:35:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T07:35:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@felixcheung

\n\nAlright, so after taking a look, here are my feedbacks:\n\n#### Overall PR\n- License of angular-esri-map will need to be added in [this file](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license/LICENSE) (That folder also contains single files if license needs to be copied)\n- There is 2 files to commit: `index.html` and `karma.conf.js` which have changes after we build.\n- I think it could be nice to have a page in the documentation, but let's make that in a different PR.\n\n#### The Map\n- The mouse scroll to zoom in the map should be deactivated, if you scroll down the notebook you might zoom out and then the map vanishes.\n- Could we have the map unzoomed to show the world when loaded (Its fine to keep it centered on Canada ;) )\n- The Map height do not scale when we make the paragraph bigger\n- The Map is going out of the paragraph instead of being contained or fitting the size:\n  <img width=\"719\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-08-02 at 5 03 20 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/710411/17321366/31e0d1a8-58d3-11e6-8a17-e383f8912b3b.png\">\n- When I click on a Pin it moves me somewhere else\n  ![mappin](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/710411/17321637/90e4d054-58d4-11e6-95ed-f8d2e63f78c7.gif)\n\n#### Options & Pivot\n- Let's remove the `height:36px` style for the pivot area, I know it was copy pasted from other place in the code, but its better to have all of them with the same height.\n- The BaseMap option isn't removed when we switch graphs, seems to be a mistake [here](https://github.com/mwpenny/zeppelin-esri/blob/esri/zeppelin-web/src/app/notebook/paragraph/paragraph-graphOptions.html#L31) with ng-if inside a class\n\nI will spend more time on checking the code, and would leave inline comments if there is\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236839637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236847435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1258#issuecomment-236847435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1258","id":236847435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjg0NzQzNQ==","user":{"login":"cloverhearts","id":10525473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts","html_url":"https://github.com/cloverhearts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T09:07:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T09:07:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ci

The idea with P2P notebook storage implementation, be that Bittorrent or Dat or any other protocol is to have:\n- a self-contained implementation (that possibly can be extracted to maven submodule later) \n- of a single class, that `implements NotebookRepo` protocol\n- and is pluggable, instead or on the side with current `VFSNotebookRepo` (for now - pluggable though a simple configuration in `zeppelin-env.sh`, later I can imagine that would be also possible though GUI)\n\nIn case only some parts of `VFSNotebookRepo` are required (not sure if that is the case or not) - we can extract them to the _skeletal implementation_ `AbstractFileSystemNotebookRepo` and make `BittorrentNotebookRepo extends AbstractFileSystemNotebookRepo`.  \n\nFor more details on this approach to design object oriented architecture please read infamous Joshua Bloch \"Effective Java, 2nd edition\" `Item18: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes` p.93 \n\n---\n\nWaiting for the diagram of current architecture and code improvements according to styleguide - please ping me and I'll be happy to make another pass tomorrow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236907774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236909563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1261#issuecomment-236909563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1261","id":236909563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjkwOTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T13:49:01Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T13:49:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have created [ZEPPELIN-1269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1269)\n\nLGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236909563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/236913421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/928#issuecomment-236913421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/928","id":236913421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjkxMzQyMQ==","user":{"login":"rawkintrevo","id":5852441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTI0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5852441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/rawkintrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-02T14:01:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T14:01:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## CI Failures in This PR\n\n#### Profile [2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/148308638/log.txt) Hangs a la [ZEPPELIN-862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-862?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN%20AND%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%29%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20flaky-test)\n\n`No output has been received in the last 10 minutes, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.`\n\n#### Profile [6](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/148308642/log.txt), [8](https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/148308647/log.txt) Network issues, can't download dependencies\n\n`[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-remote-resources-plugin:1.4:process (default) on project zeppelin: Error downloading resources archive.

you did a great job and quite possible that it is me, as a mentor, who under communicate the expectations about the architecture for this project. But..\n\nBut in order to make your work useful for the project in the nearest future, this PR must not introduce new client-facing APIs, servlets or change the existing filesystem structure a lot.\n\nSo we need to refactor your implementation and simplify, so it has a single entry point `BittorentNotebookRepo`, a class that implements `NotebookRepo`, that is both a server and a client for bittorrent protocol, and that has all the code necessary for:\n1. listing existing notes that shared through Bittorrent (local FS cache of the latest version?)\n2. checkpointing AKA creating revisions (and how use `Mutable Items`  to [store them in DHT](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0044.html))\n3. listing revisions for each note, stored in DHT\n4. importing new note by magnet URL (should work similar to current \"import by URL\")\n\nLifecycle of all objects that are needed to perform this task (i.e TorrentEngine and all others) must be tied to NotebookRepo lifecycle: \n- all connections must be opened from it's constructor\n- all connections must be closed from `.close()`\n\nPlease let me know if that makes sense to you. \n\nLet's start by finding answers to the questions on how to do 1-4 on DHT. \nLet's write answers down in English first, here or on the GDoc, before moving on to coding\\refactoring them in a programming language.\n\nPlease think about it and let me know if you have question - we can schedule a call.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/237200813/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/237208999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1247#issuecomment-237208999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1247","id":237208999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzIwODk5OQ==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T11:12:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T11:12:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@r-kamath Don't you remove the rest api in this PR?
