(1) unnecessary forward data is saved, which should be fixed by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/7d6385a515dbda096560271628abf34e91e9be63 ; (2) backward memory cannot reuse forward memory since autograd requires a standalone backward graph to be executed. I would try two things:\r\n(1) Make sure that using pure symbols give the same memory consumption as tf+keras. For example, you can try use SymbolBlock.\r\n(2) Do forward with autograd turned on, but without calling \"compute_gradient\". In this case, the forward data required by backward will be saved.\r\n\r\nIf both (1) and (2) have the same memory consumption compared with tf+keras, then the reason might due to forward and backward memory cannot be reused in autograd mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/324517773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/324518038","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7553#issuecomment-324518038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7553","id":324518038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDUxODAzOA==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-24T02:50:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T02:50:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@szha @piiswrong I find the failure is not related to the updated version of MShadow.

notice that in PyToch DataLoader, there is a parameter named num_worker, but in Gluon DataLoader, there is no such a parameter. This parameter can do multiprocess work. If I set `num_works = 0`, then PyTorch need about 100 s. So I think this is one of the reason why Gluon is much slower than PyTorch. But even if PyTorch needs 100 s, it's still faster than gluon, so I think there may be some problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/324853982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/324858024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5023#issuecomment-324858024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5023","id":324858024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDg1ODAyNA==","user":{"login":"buaacszj","id":11495403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk1NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11495403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj","html_url":"https://github.com/buaacszj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buaacszj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-25T08:36:29Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T08:36:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, have you solved this problem now?
