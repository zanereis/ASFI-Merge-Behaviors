With @saguziel recenlty returned to the team 🎉, we have 6 people working on core Airflow now.\r\n\r\nWe did migrate from from 1.8.0 to 1.10.0 eariler this year and recently migrated to 1.10.4 for one of our cluster as @pingzh mentioned. We tried to migrate w/o downtime for 1.8 -> 1.10, it was possible in theory but we wanted a smoothier migration so we spun up two cluster and rolling migrated the DAGs. We did learn quite a few lessons during the migration and would love to share them during our sync.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/536363064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/536469269","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6195#issuecomment-536469269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6195","id":536469269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjQ2OTI2OQ==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T08:57:42Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T08:57:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`--yes`

This change will appear in January and then it will definitely not matter if it is a backward compatible change. It is worth noting that when we introduced the automatic generation of API refernece we were also not worried about backwards compatibility.

Your `InitContainer` only implements a small portion of the full `kubernetes.client.models.V1Container`and requires additional code to convert to the appropriate object. This should lower the complexity and increase the functionality of this PR significantly. The old Airflow Kubernetes objects are only there for backwards compatibility API reasons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/537159729/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/537161036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6229#issuecomment-537161036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6229","id":537161036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzE2MTAzNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T18:12:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T08:50:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6229](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/76fe45e1d127b657b1aad5c0fd657e011f5a09bc?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.09%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master    #6229     +/-   ##\n=========================================\n- Coverage   80.05%   79.96%   -0.1%     \n=========================================\n  Files         610      610             \n  Lines       35264    35264             \n=========================================\n- Hits        28232    28200     -32     \n- Misses       7032     7064     +32\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/operators/postgres\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9vcGVyYXRvcnMvcG9zdGdyZXNfb3BlcmF0b3IucHk=) | `0% <0%> (-100%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/hooks/postgres\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9wb3N0Z3Jlc19ob29rLnB5) | `94.73% <0%> (-1.76%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/utils/sqlalchemy.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9zcWxhbGNoZW15LnB5) | `91.52% <0%> (-1.7%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/hooks/dbapi\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9kYmFwaV9ob29rLnB5) | `86.44% <0%> (-1.7%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/utils/dag\\_processing.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy91dGlscy9kYWdfcHJvY2Vzc2luZy5weQ==) | `56.37% <0%> (-0.52%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/models/taskinstance.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMvdGFza2luc3RhbmNlLnB5) | `93.24% <0%> (-0.51%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6229?src=pr&el=footer).

\r\n\r\nIMO if your operator and sensor refer to the same resource (job, query, etc.) you'd almost always want to use async operator. This has to do w/ retries if your sensor fails and you want to retry the submit, then it should be async operator (this wouldn't be possible w/ operator+sensor w/o a whole re-run of the DAG).\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear differing opinions here.\r\n@dstandish mentioned ([slack](https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CCY359SCV/p1569608756022600?thread_ts=1569540521.006000&cid=CCY359SCV)) if polling / retrival is lower priority than kicking the job off this could be a reason to have separate operator + sensor. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Should I try to create an operator that could be used in sync or async mode by passing an `async=True` flag?\r\n\r\nI was just thinking about this today as well. Similarly: \"for our existing operators how do we expose async versions\". Are these new operators? I think you could develop a new operator that extends `BaseAsyncOperator` you would define a submit_request, process_request, and poke. The you'd override `execute` with something that checks \r\n```python3\r\nif self.async:\r\n  super().execute(context)  # use the `BaseAsyncOperator`'s execute defined in this PR.\r\nelse:\r\n    #Note this is what most operators that wait on long running operations look like.\r\n   self.submit_request(context)\r\n   while not self.poke():\r\n       time.sleep(self.poke_interval)\r\n   self.process_results(context)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/537192679/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/537199801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6210#issuecomment-537199801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6210","id":537199801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzE5OTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"jaketf","id":11599048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk5MDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11599048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf","html_url":"https://github.com/jaketf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaketf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T19:49:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T19:49:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Actually I started with `flake8-import-order` and moved to `isort` primarily because `isort` got the sorting check and engine in one package. I would still prefer to use `isort` for that reason and also for that it has been around for much longer than `zimports`, which I assume more people are comfortable with it and is more mature.
