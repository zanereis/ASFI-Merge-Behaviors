I am a coauthor of streamparse, a Python interop library for Storm. We currently rely on lein and the Clojure DSL to build topologies because this issue exists. As described in this Twitter conversation, this is an impediment for new users wanting to use Storm and Python together:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/sarthakdev/status/539390816339247104\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://mobile.twitter.com/sarthakdev/status/539390816339247104</a></p>\n\n<p>I planned on building a Python DSL that generated appropriate Clojure DSL code to simplify pure Python use cases. I could imagine the same Python DSL also generating the JSON format that this issue might add to the Storm core. This might help make Python a first-class citizen in Storm ecosystem. I'd therefore love to volunteer my team's time for this and discuss further.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4402#issuecomment-2612511166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4402","id":2612511166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTExNjY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-02T04:27:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:17:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ncleung\">ncleung</a>:</i>\n<p>Thanks for the offer.  The initial implementation is almost done, I just need to rework how I construct arguments to better support containers and arrays (which is required to create the fieldsGrouping).  Also I would like to solicit feedback on how I'm planning to handle arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Currently class Argument works the following way:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\"><span class=\"code-keyword\">class </span>Argument {\n    <span class=\"code-object\">String</span> argumentType;  <span class=\"code-comment\">// <span class=\"code-object\">Class</span> used to lookup arguments in method/constructor\n</span>    <span class=\"code-object\">String</span> implementationType; <span class=\"code-comment\">// <span class=\"code-object\">Class</span> used to create <span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span> argument\n</span>    <span class=\"code-object\">String</span> value; <span class=\"code-comment\">// <span class=\"code-object\">String</span> used to construct <span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span> argument\n</span>    List<Argument> arguments; <span class=\"code-comment\">// arguments used to build <span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span> argument\n</span>}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>argumentType - this is the type that gets created.  The argument creator will automatically search for constructors using supertypes.  This should be a fully qualified class name.  Arrays are represented by the fulling qualified class name + \"[]\" (e.g. \"java.lang.Integer[]\"), though I would consider changing this to use the java class name of the array type (e.g. \"[Ljava.lang.Integer;\").</li>\n\t<li>value - If argumentType and implementationType are not specified, it is assumed that the argumentType is java.lang.String, and the value is passed as-is. If this is a typical object and this string is specified, the argument builder will look for a constructor that takes a single string as an input parameter.  If this argument is an array, then \"value\" will be used to create an element that will populate the array.

Currently I've placed the topology building code into the storm-core project in my branch (it seemed the most appropriate at the time).  With that in mind, I tried to avoid a couple of things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Adding a serializer dependency to storm-core (e.g. gson)</li>\n\t<li>Putting overly complicated objects into the serialized representation.  My experience with json indicates that this often leads to a requirement for custom serializers or deserializers and I wanted to avoid this.  I guess the arguments can be kind of clunky though.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>That said, I'm not sure I'm 100% happy with how things are structured right now.  I have the topology building classes in storm-core, as well as an unmarshalling interface that is used to pass an unmarshaller to the topology building code.

Thanks for this last comment and all your input. I removed cluster.shutdown(), and the topology continues to run until stopped manually. So, now the confusion lies with output of errors in 0.9.3 vs output of 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL' in 0.9.2. This is very confusing to new users of Storm. Maybe WordCountTopology could be changed in a way that conforms more to the principle of least surprise.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612504570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4402#issuecomment-2612511183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4402","id":2612511183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTExODM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-03T08:33:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:17:34Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jr\">jr</a>:</i>\n<p>I was thinking the object itself, not a serialized representation.

I think you'll find things a lot easier to just create the Thrift objects directly in Python code. Storm is designed so that you don't even have to touch Java or any JVM language in order to construct and submit topologies.</p>\n\n<p>Storm already has the ability to create topologies completely dynamically, where we define \"dynamically\" as not needing any recompilation. Storm's Thrift interfaces allow you to:</p>\n\n<p>1. Create spout and bolt object of any language implementation from any other language. The ComponentObject struct can be specified either as a serialized java object, a java class name + arguments, or as a ShellComponent (for running spouts/bolts via subprocesses to allow for other languages).<br/>\n2. Define topologies from any language. Storm gets this for free by the nature of topologies being Thrift objects.<br/>\n3. Submit topologies from any language. Again, Storm gets this for free by the nature of Nimbus being a Thrift server and topologies being Thrift objects.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the majority of what's been proposed in this issue is redundant with what's already in Storm. The exception is Trident, but that should have its own issue opened for this feature.</p>\n\n<p>The direction I'd like to see a patch for this issue go is making a nice <b>library</b> in an interpreted language (like Python) that makes a pretty wrapper interface around the Thrift stuff, since manipulating Thrift objects directly is a little verbose. In addition, it can handle packaging of any artifacts the topology will need (like spout and bolt implementations) into a .jar file. The generated Python code for manipulating the Thrift structures is packaged with Storm at storm-core/src/py/. </p>\n\n<p>For reference, here's the storm.thrift file: <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/storm.thrift\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/storm.thrift</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612504576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4373#issuecomment-2612504576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4373","id":2612504576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MDQ1NzY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-04T08:54:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:14:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mujain\">mujain</a>:</i>\n<p>Agree with Brandon. </p>\n\n<p>I am new to storm and just downloaded storm and storm-starter code and tried running.
