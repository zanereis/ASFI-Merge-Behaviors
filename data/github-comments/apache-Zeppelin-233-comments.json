This makes management difficult and maintaining consistency challenging.\r\n- For example, Thrift is managed in `zeppelin-interpreter` and proto in `zeppelin-jupyter-interpreter`.\r\n\r\n_(Therefore, instead of creating a separate zeppelin-protocol module, another alternative could be to manage `zeppelin.interpreter.thrift` and` zeppelin.interpreter.proto` within `zeppelin-interpreter` to avoid unforeseen side effects due to `InterpreterCompletion`.)_\r\n\r\n### Improvement Goal\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve protocol management by starting with separating Thrift files into a zeppelin-protocol module.\r\n\r\n- `zeppelin-protocol `will manage files generated from `.thrift` and `.grpc` files (.java, .py, etc.) collectively. This ensures consistent communication methods among interpreters via `zeppelin-protocol`. Additionally, using pom.xml to generate protocol-related files helps maintain build integrity without running shell scripts manually.\r\n\r\n- Interpreters needing communication can add `zeppelin-protocol` as a dependency. For instance, it can be difficult to know if proto communication is needed by `zeppelin-interpreter` or `zeppelin-jupyter-interpreter`. Adding `zeppelin-protocol` as a dependency makes accessing necessary protocol dependencies straightforward.\r\n\r\n- When new interpreters are added, the `zeppelin-protocol `module facilitates the easy expansion of communication features. For example, if Zeppelin introduces a new language interpreter, it can utilize the required protocol files from `zeppelin-protocol`. Additionally, if Thrift or gRPC features are expanded, updating `zeppelin-protocol` ensures that all related interpreters can benefit from these enhancements. Moreover, even if new protocol files or shell scripts are needed, they are managed within a single module, preventing an increase in scattered management points.\r\n\r\nLastly, I understand there may be concerns regarding this PR and am open to discussing alternatives. The primary goal is to efficiently manage scattered protocol-related shell scripts and generated files.

My goal is to merge zeppelin-interpreter, zeppelin-interpreter-parent and zeppelin-interpreter-shaded. :-) (I know the history but I believe that we can find a better way to manage them)\r\n\r\nMoreover, I agree that we change the name to `zeppelin-thrift` and so on as the first step.
