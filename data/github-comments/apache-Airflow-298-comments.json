From what I can tell, the constructor `__init__()` is not the only way a `TaskInstance` can be created. E.g. sometimes `TaskInstance.task` is not set when the `TaskInstance` is created from deserialization or be read from database via sqlalchemy.\r\n\r\nOne place I think it should be kept is in `_run_raw_task`. If the DAG author changes the type of an existing task that has been executed before to another class, without changing the task_id, we probably want the next execution of the task to update the `TaskInstance.operator` to the new type.\r\n\r\n@ashb  what do you
