The way they use it is to have a bundle of common code, re-used and pulled into other bundles when they are loaded. Like, hadoop common get's pulled into the hadoop processors and the hadoop controllers which are separate bundles\r\n\r\nMy question was, since it throws an exception if no Bundle dependency is stated, if I have a Bundle that is _not_ actually dependent on any other bundles, what should I declare it is dependent on?  This info should be added to the README after the current paragraph about Bundle dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Ambiguous usage of \"type\"\r\n>> I'm confused. Is this (\"type\") the maven artifact classifier, or the archive file extension?\r\n\r\n> I did not modify that, it does not have to do with the archive file extension\r\n\r\nAgree you didn't modify it in BundleMojo, but in [BundleMojo.java:L685](https://github.com/ottobackwards/metron/blob/METRON-777/bundles-maven-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/maven/plugins/bundles/BundleMojo.java#L685) we have 'type' being used as a file extension:\r\n`return new File(basedir, finalName + classifier + \".\" + type );`\r\n\r\nAnd you added it to [BundleProvidedDependenciesMojo:L82-L89](https://github.com/ottobackwards/metron/blob/METRON-777/bundles-maven-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/maven/plugins/bundles/BundleProvidedDependenciesMojo.java#L82-L89), where it is documented as:\r\n```\r\n   * The type we are using for dependencies, should be bundle, but may\r\n   * be changed in the configuration if the plugin is producing\r\n   * other archive extensions...\r\n```\r\nwhich sure sounds like a file extension?\r\n\r\nSo, the above questions are really for information because I find the code confusing.  I think the answer is that the code (which you didn't write) simply does confuse, or combine, the two usages of \"type\" as both classifier (sometimes) and file extension (other times).

Trying to avoid too far a departure ( at the time ) from nifi, bundle-lib maintained the 'create folders and files as nec'\r\nscheme found in nifi.  Since nifi is always working with local disk and File objects, this is ok. But with VFS and HDFS this did not work.  The work around\r\nwas to create a poop static 'class cluster' type step with multiple implemenations of FileUtils ( VFS and HDFS ).\r\n\r\nThe new approach, which is a more willing departure from the nifi approach, is to avoid having to ever do writes ( file or folder creation ) from bundles-lib at all.\r\nThis allows for a simplier, single implementation of the file utils and the removal of the anti-pattern.  It also removes the need for a 'working' area.\r\n\r\nThe new approach is to better utilize the capabilities of VFS such that we never have to unpack the bundle at all.  VFS can load JAR files as Filesystems. I have created\r\na new Classloader ( based on the VFS classloader implemenation from the VFS project ) that is bundle aware.  It can load the bundle and it's dependencies as resources\r\nand make them available.  This is what removes the requirement to unpack the bundles into a working directory.\r\n\r\nAs such, the bundle-lib has been refactored to move from the 'working directory' to only needing to work with the bundle in the lib.  I have also removed the doc directory support\r\nsince we are not using it.\r\n\r\nWe no longer need multiple file utils, the hdfs working directory, and other things.\r\n\r\nThanks to mattf for the time and discussion.\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/318960341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319021624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/674#issuecomment-319021624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/674","id":319021624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTAyMTYyNA==","user":{"login":"basvdl","id":123811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl","html_url":"https://github.com/basvdl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basvdl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T09:51:41Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T09:51:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ottobackwards you mean something like https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-common/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/common/writer/BulkMessageWriter.java#L34","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319021624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319055646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/674#issuecomment-319055646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/674","id":319055646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTA1NTY0Ng==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T12:41:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T12:41:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.

A couple questions:\r\n1) I was under the impression that our local copy of the nar functionality would be a hard fork that would naturally deviate from the NiFi based on our own requirements. In fact, I thought the entire reason for our fork was because of features we needed that did not make sense for NiFi. Do we really want to consider pulling patches going forward? I'm also in support of keeping bundles-lib and bundles-maven-plugin at the top level, per @mattf-horton's comments, though I don't think we want to have to worry about merges and cherry-picking commits, especially since we forked local. Just a thought.\r\n2) Regarding the bundle loading, have you looked at the work from https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/468 for loading from HDFS? Any overlap there?\r\n\r\nSince this is a relatively large chunk of functionality, I decided that my testing methodology for this feature should be use case driven.

I don't think we want to, or have to track it as upstream.  But we do want to keep track of bug fixes and improvements to areas where we have not deviated.  That is my current thinking.  \r\n2. I certainly did look at [#468](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/468).  Here is how we are related:\r\n\r\n- 777 uses the same VFS Classloader, although I have modified a new version of the classloader to load a bundle as a compound filesystem.  That is to say, instead of VFSClassloader loading a number of Jar uris, it loads a bundle, and then finds all the embedded dependency jars as well.  This I believe is an improvement on the NAR system, since there is no longer a requirement to unbundle the NAR into a working directory and all the overhead that has.\r\n- 777 uses the ClassIndex System.  I have replaced the NAR service loader dependency ( in the archetype ) with ClassIndex.  I have also made the loaders work with class index's multiple ways for marking classes.  This is an improvement on the NAR system because:\r\n1. You do not have to manually maintain the service file in the jar metadata\r\n2. It is faster\r\n\r\nOne of my goals is to have Extensions/Bundles+archetypes for Stellar libraries as well.  I believe that 777 is done in a way that is comparable with that goal, and enables it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319740053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319740534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/530#issuecomment-319740534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/530","id":319740534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTc0MDUzNA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T17:23:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T17:23:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh profiler integration test","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319740534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319883188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/678#issuecomment-319883188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/678","id":319883188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTg4MzE4OA==","user":{"login":"anandsubbu","id":20395490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20395490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/anandsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T06:46:29Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T06:46:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 (non-binding)\r\n\r\nValidated that with this fix, Ambari displays the correct status as opposed to the earlier behavior.

I think it may be too severe given how dirty and sparse our data tends to be.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that if you have a stellar expression `FOO(bar)` and the field `bar` doesn't exist, will we get an exception?  If so, given that messages come through with certain fields which are optional (i.e. some messages have field `foo` and others might not have a field `foo` depending on the parser), I think this will result in a fair number of errors.\r\n\r\nI'd rather leave it up to the Stellar function creator to figure out if the field is able to be optional or not rather than having a blanket policy of throwing an exception.

I'd rather `TO_UPPER` tolerate missing fields by passing them through (i.e. `TO_UPPER(null) == null`) rather than throw an exception.\r\n\r\nOne approach to this would be changing the `StellarFunction` interface to a `List<Optional<Object>>` instead of a `List<Object>` and have the variability made explicit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319974804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/319977447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/675#issuecomment-319977447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/675","id":319977447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTk3NzQ0Nw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T14:00:35Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T14:00:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, wait, I think I might've misunderstood.
