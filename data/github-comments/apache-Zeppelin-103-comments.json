Will do shortly.\n\n@Leemoonsoo \nThe latest commit should fix the issue I just mentioned. Two other important things to mention:\n\n1) Any print statements made prior to printing the `%html` or `%angular` won't show up in the results. This means that when `close=False` and when any plots are open, print statements won't display since the output type magic will always come after user entered print-statements. This can be fixed for the matplotlib backend specifically by adding a pre-execute hook that prints the magic of the currently open plot, but it's not really ideal. \n\n2) ~~Earlier we both had issues loading the tutorial notebook. As it turns out, the reason appears to be due the angular display system. This happens whenever I stop Zeppelin whenever variables are still bound to the angular display system. If I make sure to unbind everything first, then I can safely start Zeppelin again. I am pretty sure this issue was introduced in more recent commits since I didn't have this problem when I first made the tutorial notebook. It was not until after I rebased my branch to reproduce the problem when you initially discovered it. This is actually a serious issue, and in this case it would be bad to leave it unaddressed with this PR since that would mean anyone that runs the last example in the tutorial notebook without calling `plt.close()` at the end will brick their zeppelin installation until removing the notebook.~~ Seems like this was fixed as of #1590. \n\nHow do you think we should proceed?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258333737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258342137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1471#issuecomment-258342137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1471","id":258342137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODM0MjEzNw==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T04:23:19Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T04:23:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So cool guys, sorry, I have totally missed out on this - it looks great and CI is green now!\n\nLooks like every feedback has been addressed by now? \n\nQuick question on test and CI - it seems that there is `scio` build profile that is not part of any [TravisCI](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/.travis.yml#L42) build?

LGTM.\n\nBut, after looking all around Notebook REST API, it works well now but it doesn't seem RESTful. I summarized current list of REST API:\n- `GET`     /\n- `POST`    /\n- `GET`     /[noteId]\n- `POST`    /[noteId] \n- `DELETE`  /[noteId]\n- `GET`     /job/[noteId]\n- `POST`    /job/[noteId]\n- `DELETE`  /job/[noteId]\n- `GET`     /job/[noteId]/[paragraphId]\n- `POST`    /job/[noteId]/[paragraphId]\n- `DELETE`  /job/[noteId]/[paragraphId]\n- `POST`    /run/[noteId]/[paragraphId]\n- `GET`     /cron/[noteId]\n- `POST`    /cron/[noteId]\n- `DELETE`  /cron/[noteId]\n- `GET`     /search?q=[query]\n- `POST`    /[noteId]/paragraph\n- `GET`     /[noteId]/paragraph/[paragraphId]\n- `DELETE`  /[noteId]/paragraph/[paragraphId]\n- `POST`    /[noteId]/paragraph/[paragraphId]/move/[newIndex]\n- `GET`     /export/[noteId]\n- `POST`    /import\n\nA good REST API is API that doesn't need a documentation, which means users can understands only with HTTP method and URL. So, it should be simple. However, I think some of current API may need to be changed.\n\nREST API is UI for developers, so should be well designed. There are problems I can see now:\n- Need to organize resources of Zeppelin: hierarchy of resources, and what they have; For example:\n  - Need hierarchical URL design: `notebook/:noteId/paragraphs/:paragraphId/{title|text|result|job}`\n  - Do jobs belong to notebook or paragraph?\n- Use plural\n- Use nouns as far as you can, no verbs. Make use of HTTP methods. URL should point resources.\n- For in the case of a request that doesn't fit CRUD(Create(POST), Read(GET), Update(PUT|PATCH), Detele(DELETE)), we need a rule for this. Heroku deals with this by placing actions for the resource under `/actions`. For example, in our case, run all paragraphs can be represented as `POST notebook/:noteId/actions/run`\n- Need API versioning\n\nZeppelin needs more REST API, so eventually, it will be getting bigger. I think it's time to organize REST APIs. After all of this, the REST API documentation should also be updated. Not by listing actions what you can, just by listing APIs. This is easier to read since users can know what they can do with resources. \n\nWould you mind if I open an issue for this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258343479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258344172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1594#issuecomment-258344172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1594","id":258344172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODM0NDE3Mg==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T04:46:34Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T04:51:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Websequence are awesome, thank you @1ambda for contributing this simplification of MD interpreter.\n\nLooks good to me, modulo few minor issues, commented above. \n\\cc @felixcheung as I remeber he was a [user of YUML and Websequence](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1384#issuecomment-243873541)\n\nAs soon as CI is green and issues addressed - will be happy to merge to master, in case there is no further discussion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258344172/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258344276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1565#issuecomment-258344276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1565","id":258344276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODM0NDI3Ng==","user":{"login":"anthonycorbacho","id":3139557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzk1NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3139557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho","html_url":"https://github.com/anthonycorbacho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anthonycorbacho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T04:47:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T04:47:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tae-jun This is a great sum of the status of the rest api in zeppelin, and i think we all agree that currently zeppelin doenst follow rest standard (just by looking at the endpoint + response (mostly 500 ...)).\n\nBut you have to consider that going on the path of refacto this logic will be a huge task, not only in backend but you need to understand that a lot of users are using this api already changing the hole api will brings a lot of breaking change in they current workflow.

And keep legacy API under `api/notebook` for backward compatibility. This will be the start of versioning.\n\nI think we should design REST API together.

@zjffdu I placed the extra call to `open()` in `jobRun` because I wanted to have a convenient place to make calls to `registerHook()`. We can't do this in the `Interpreter` constructor since the `InterpreterGroup` (which stores the hook registry) will not necessarily be set yet. The only other way I can think of doing this without another rewrite of the hook system would be to instead override the `setInterpreterGroup()` method to call `registerHook()` after setting the `InterpreterGroup`. Not very elegant, but it will probably get the job done (pun not intended). Actually, it might be the better approach to what we are doing now since we would no longer have to worry about checking for null pointers.\n\nThat being said, could you explain why this change is in itself necessary?

Apache Mahout is a kind of special case, in that really we're a set of libraries that can run on currently Spark, Flink, H20 runners, and possible additionals ones (such as beam in the future).  We are however not super aggressive when it comes to supporting spark version changes [MAHOUT-1889](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT-1889).
