seems we generally agree to support pluggable cache. How about allow users to specify ClientPool implementation class via a catalog property, and HiveCatalog can instantiate ClientPool instance accordingly. We probably need an `initialize` method in `ClientPool` so that catalogs can pass the configurations, similar to the one in `Catalog` API. Something like this:\r\n```java\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Initialize the client pool with catalog properties and an optional hadoop configuration.\r\n   *\r\n   * <p>A custom ClientPool implementation must have a no-arg constructor.

On the other hand I believe if we rewrite the table to compact the data files with the delete files then {B} would be gone from the output.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is any way to get around this problem. With position deletes would it be possible to compare the record_count of a partition with the new pos_delete_record_count and don't show the partition if they match? Is there a use case where these 2 numbers won't be equal even though the whole partition has been deleted using position deletes? This won't solve the issue with equality deletes, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1325015704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1325048407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6136#issuecomment-1325048407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6136","id":1325048407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85O-qJX","user":{"login":"giqbal","id":20801666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODAxNjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20801666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal","html_url":"https://github.com/giqbal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giqbal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-23T13:14:42Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T13:14:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"In a similar predicament.

I'm not saying that we should definitely implement the code to apply the delete files to omit these partitions, I just think that we might want to re-consider if this is worth the work and the extra perf impact. Hence, I opened #6257 because this topic feels a bit different as the current ticket is for introducing new fields in the metadata table while the one I opened is for discussing whether we want to introduce applying delete files to get rid of partitions from the output that got renamed meanwhile.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1326214188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1326214219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6262#issuecomment-1326214219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6262","id":1326214219,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85PDGxL","user":{"login":"yinshan612","id":85284614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1Mjg0NjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85284614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612","html_url":"https://github.com/yinshan612","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinshan612/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-24T09:57:02Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T09:57:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Collaborator\r\n\r\nIt means that when monitoring a table through the stream read of iceberg, the table can only be append, not update or delete.

update:\r\nI have a PoC for the new MultiDimensionCounter<T> type. There are some rough edges but apart from the Json conversions seems to work fine. The from-Json part is a bit tricky because the code has to be aware what the generic parameter type is for the multi-dimensional counter so I had to also write this info into Json and use reflection to recreate the type. Apart from this the ScanReportParser and ScanMetricsResultParser tests fail because the order of the Json elements seems to matter for the asserts but the order of the elements in the multi-dimensional counter is not guaranteed. Working on fixing these and I'll upload new patch.\r\nThis is where I'm now: https://github.com/gaborkaszab/iceberg/commit/b268f65f3d588f30c637aa3db3f53be2a5f4c80d","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1327480362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1327520903","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6273#issuecomment-1327520903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6273","id":1327520903,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85PIFyH","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-25T14:11:35Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T14:11:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Kirito-Aus I don't think this issue is related to Iceberg itself.
