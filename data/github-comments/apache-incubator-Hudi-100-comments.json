Its a core abstraction and good to preserve that connection. Wdyt?\r\n\r\nPerhaps different understandings depend on what we think this class will assume in the future and the boundaries of services. I want to change its name because it seems to be easily confused with `BaseFileHandler`. People who don't know the details will think that they are the same type of handler, but it is not.\r\n\r\nThis module used to provide web services or RESTful API for timeline. It has many handlers (more in the future?) and one handler-registry(URI mapping, or say router)which is easy to understand?\r\n\r\n> I suggest we not remove FileSystemView part of the name.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can keep it. But when we provide more services in the future, maybe it will be a bit limited?\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think that if this is the `hudi-web-ui` or `hudi-rest-api` module, it is more appropriate to call it router.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/762902669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/762912177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2441#issuecomment-762912177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2441","id":762912177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MjkxMjE3Nw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-19T15:21:37Z","updated_at":"2021-01-19T15:21:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@prashantwason
