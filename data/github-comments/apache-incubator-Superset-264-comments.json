When you \"Edit Dashboard\" there's an option to add CSS. If the number and sequence of these Big Number components on your dashboard is static, you can use CSS nth-of-type trickery. I made a quick example to illustrate the case:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/68715696-70252e80-0557-11ea-931d-3942573b9a88.png)\r\n\r\nSyles applied here are as follows.\r\n\r\n1) Set the background color of each instance.\r\n```\r\n.superset-legacy-chart-big-number:nth-of-type(1){\r\n    background: orange;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Put the subheader where you want it (you can set the width so it wraps, etc.)\r\n```\r\n.superset-legacy-chart-big-number .subheader-line {\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    bottom: 10px;\r\n    left: 10px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) Add a CSS pseudo element, and give it the icon you want as a background.\r\n```\r\n.superset-legacy-chart-big-number:nth-of-type(1)::after {\r\n    content: '';\r\n    display: block;\r\n    height: 60px;\r\n    width: 60px;\r\n    background: url(https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/121/121901.png);\r\n    background-size: contain;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    bottom: 20px;\r\n    right: 20px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's super hacky, but might get you the result you want without having to make new components.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553144943/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553171849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8095#issuecomment-553171849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8095","id":553171849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzE3MTg0OQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T23:54:20Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T23:54:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Thanks for the response. It sounds to me like this isn't a great fit for inclusion in Superset at this point. As Max brought up, data enrichment isn't part of the scope of this project. You may want to check out one of our related projects, [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). Airflow is designed for building data pipelines, and you could implement what you need for data enrichment on top of that platform without needing to extend the core. After enriching your data, Superset can be used to visualize and explore the data. Were I tasked with a similar problem in my day to day work, that's how I would implement it.

And the result of this \"transformation\" is being stored just for computational reasons - very much like aggregations are also often materialized.\r\n\r\nAre there other reasons of this kind of geocoding which bother you?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553552476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553575880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8558#issuecomment-553575880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8558","id":553575880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzU3NTg4MA==","user":{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T19:58:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T19:58:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"lgtm but build fails for some reason, so I restart CI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553575880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553580888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8558#issuecomment-553580888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8558","id":553580888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzU4MDg4OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T20:11:05Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T20:11:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8558?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#8558](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8558?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/1a5c2573b7c7753bd73df83026b5ea2c358b3edb?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8558/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8558?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@          Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master   #8558   +/-   ##\n======================================\n  Coverage    66.8%   66.8%           \n======================================\n  Files         450     450           \n  Lines       22734   22734           \n  Branches     2366    2366           \n======================================\n  Hits        15187   15187           \n  Misses       7409    7409           \n  Partials      138     138\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8558?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8558?src=pr&el=footer).

Geocoding is a classic example. Data enrichment isn't something that Superset currently does at all, so it's a big proposal and should be thought about in the context of other possible data enrichment adds.\r\n\r\nI am generally of the opinion that whatever format people's data is in, Superset should make an attempt to \"just work\". While the changes proposed above are probably not a great fit, there might be another approach that would fit better. Maybe adding a Geocode option to the deck.gl charts could work? This wouldn't include the optimizations around things like requests per second or caching, but it would be a simpler implementation, and would stay within the MapBox TOS.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553668127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/553669897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8566#issuecomment-553669897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8566","id":553669897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzY2OTg5Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-14T00:36:56Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T00:37:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#8566](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/59bc220602a1e74f3df19902978512f276ee2d88?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.14%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master   #8566      +/-   ##\n=========================================\n+ Coverage   66.66%   66.8%   +0.14%     \n=========================================\n  Files         450     450              \n  Lines       22734   22734              \n  Branches     2366    2366              \n=========================================\n+ Hits        15155   15187      +32     \n+ Misses       7441    7409      -32     \n  Partials      138     138\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/connectors/druid/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvY29ubmVjdG9ycy9kcnVpZC9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `82.43% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/utils/core.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvdXRpbHMvY29yZS5weQ==) | `88.81% <0%> (+0.16%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/base.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL2Jhc2UucHk=) | `80.33% <0%> (+0.33%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/connectors/sqla/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvY29ubmVjdG9ycy9zcWxhL21vZGVscy5weQ==) | `84.81% <0%> (+0.64%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/sqlite.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL3NxbGl0ZS5weQ==) | `66.66% <0%> (+9.99%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/dataframe.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGF0YWZyYW1lLnB5) | `94.48% <0%> (+10.23%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs/postgres.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzL3Bvc3RncmVzLnB5) | `83.33% <0%> (+27.77%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8566?src=pr&el=footer).

It is also an activity that is against the terms of service of the majority of map vendors, or those vendors provide rules for the allowed duration of retention. I have a few concerns:\r\n\r\n1. Creating a back-end system for data enrichment is a large increase in scope for Superset.\r\n2. There are other projects in the Apache ecosystem (primarily one from the founder of this project) that are specifically designed for this type of task, and are frequently used in conjunction with Superset.\r\n3.

Depending on whether you configure these things to use threads or workers (subprocesses), you can end up with a lot of connections very quickly that is vastly bigger than the number of **active** connections. One problem is that while you probably want to cap the number of connections to your db, you want do have a dynamic number of workers as you need more capacity. \r\n\r\nThere's also a challenge around the fact that threading and SQLAlchemy pools have intricate issues. There are endless stackoverflows documenting this.\r\n\r\nAnother thought is that we may want to limit concurrency to analytics databases, but this approach is not achieving that in any way as there's no global state shared across server/workers. This would need to get handled as some sort of environment global variable (redis?) that would keep track of the number of active connections.\r\n\r\nWhat's the cost of spawning / destroying a connection? On the server / on the client? Milliseconds of CPU time?
