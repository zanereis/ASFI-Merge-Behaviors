Especially around the notion of SensitiveParameterProvider vs NonSensitiveParameterProvider and those really becoming a single interface. I think this would yield a cleaner design. And we need to be really careful that we nail this down really well the first time because once we introduce something into `nifi-api` we can't really break backward compatibility until a 2.0 release comes, so let's take the time to make sure we're both in agreement on what makes the most sense there.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks again!\r\n\r\nThanks for a thorough review, @markap14, this is very helpful!

Rather than having the value of a secret be a 'plaintext' value, perhaps it makes more sense to use the key/value pairs that the UI is tailored to?\r\n\r\nSo then, instead of treating each secret as a separate parameter, we would treat each AWS Secret like a Parameter Context. And each parameter would then map to one of those key/value pairs. Then users can just go into AWS Secrets Manager, create a new Secret, and enter all of their parameters that they care about. Then the provider would be configured with a mapping of ParameterContext Name to Secret Name, with a default Secret Name to be used if there is no mapping.\r\n\r\nFor example, if my flow has ContextA and ContextB, I could configure the Provider so that ContextA maps to secret SecretA and ContextB maps to SecretB. Or I could configure it so that ContextA maps to SecretA and ContextB maps to SecretA. Or configure it so that ContextA maps to SecretA and not provide a mapping for ContextB, just specifying SecretA as the default secret name.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this approach?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/931391414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/931591215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5391#issuecomment-931591215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5391","id":931591215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM43hvQv","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T19:10:05Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T19:10:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thoughts on this approach?\r\n\r\n@markap14 Thanks for describing some options for implementation, particularly in relation to the AWS Secrets Manager web user interface.

Yes, I agree there could be some benefit to also allowing for a 'plaintext' approach, but I also think we should choose an approach to start and say this is how it works. If a need arises to allow for plaintext, we can look into it then. I do not think we should attempt to parse JSON and if it fails, fallback to 'plaintext', though. Instead, it makes sense to me to either have two separate Provider implementations or to have a configuration option in the Provider that says how to handle the data. A really good thing to consider is for Google Cloud credentials, you generally will be given a JSON document that contains a Base64 encoded certificate. So we have a secret JSON document, which would cause a lot of confusion if we attempted to separate those into separate key/value pairs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/931741211/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/931776405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5417#issuecomment-931776405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5417","id":931776405,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM43iceV","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T23:26:54Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T23:26:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tested this out with a standalone node using X509, LDAP with a nginx reverse proxy.

As a result, we can have a situation where we create a lot of files in the content repository - so much so that we cannot keep up with deleting data that's no longer needed, and we can start running out of disk space.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, we have a backpressure mechanism where the content repo decides that the threshold has been reached, so it's not going to allow any new FlowFIles to be written until a background thread has had a chance to archive or destroy unneeded data in the content repository.\r\n\r\nSo those 2 properties work together. When `nifi.content.repository.archive.backpressure.percentage` is reached, it applies backpressure and prevents writing until the background thread reduces disk usage to below the `nifi.content.repository.archive.max.usage.percentage` threshold. So if `nifi.content.repository.archive.max.usage.percentage` is set to 50%, and `nifi.content.repository.archive.backpressure.percentage` is set to 60% it will allow content to be written until repo is 60% full. Then it will prevent it until repo is less than 50% full. If `nifi.content.repository.archive.backpressure.percentage` is not set, it defaults to 2% more than `nifi.content.repository.archive.max.usage.percentage`. So 52% by default.\r\n\r\nOr, said another way - they function together as the low-water mark & high-water mark :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/936447902/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/936793979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5438#issuecomment-936793979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5438","id":936793979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM431ld7","user":{"login":"sdairs","id":8709801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDk4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8709801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs","html_url":"https://github.com/sdairs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdairs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-06T17:54:55Z","updated_at":"2021-10-06T17:54:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14  Thanks for the solid description 😄  Hopefully I've captured it correctly in this commit ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/936793979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/937314291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4691#issuecomment-937314291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4691","id":937314291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM433kfz","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-06T23:10:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-06T23:10:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I noticed that using the NIFI-7990.json flow definition, using `PutElasticsearchHttpRecord`, `@timestamp` for record \"1\" appears to be a numeric type but for record \"2\" it appears to be a string type:\r\n> ...\r\n> However, using `PutElasticsearchRecord`, `@timestamp` is consistently a numeric type:\r\n> ...\r\n> I don't know if this is actually a problem in ES, but wanted to point it out in case we need to update the @timestamp code to make it consistent in the two cases.\r\n\r\nGood spot!

PR #5435 adding Azure Key Vault Secret SPP addresses this issue with a method named `isMissingProperties()` in the parent `AzureClientProvider`. Implementing classes provided required property names, which determine whether or not the Client will be initialized. This in turns drives how the SPP responds to `isSupported()`. Taking a similar approach here in `AbstractAwsClientProvider` should resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nAh, good catch.  I believe I forgot to remove the `aws.kms.key.id` from my existing configuration during testing.\r\n\r\nThe implementation ended up being so similar to #5435 that I believe whichever of these two PRs land second could possibly refactor out some of the common logic between these two client providers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/938246704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/938248214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5332#issuecomment-938248214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5332","id":938248214,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM437IgW","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T00:32:37Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T00:32:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory ready to go","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/938248214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/938428212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5435#issuecomment-938428212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5435","id":938428212,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4370c0","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T07:57:17Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T07:57:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
