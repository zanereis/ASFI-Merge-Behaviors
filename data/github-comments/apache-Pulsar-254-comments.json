We ran into this issue again. The cluster ended up in a split-brain situation with its bookies. I didn't think that was possible with the way Bookkeeper uses fencing, but the split-brain appeared to be happening on the zookeeper-side. \r\n\r\nOne of the bookies was stopped for a couple of days, and when it was started again, the entire bookie cluster went haywire. \r\nThe other bookies in the cluster started throwing connection errors. \r\nThe journal queue length on the one bookie that remained healthy reached 147 million, and the others were all under 1 million. \r\nWhen checking ZK, we noticed that the bookies were getting swapped between one bookie and the other bookies, like they were racing to write to /loadbalance/brokers/ and something was incorrectly overwriting values. It's not clear if there was a sync issue with the zookeeper nodes, but we think that's possible. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/712490415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/712496687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8303#issuecomment-712496687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8303","id":712496687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMjQ5NjY4Nw==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-19T23:28:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T23:28:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/712496687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/712498202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6151#issuecomment-712498202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6151","id":712498202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMjQ5ODIwMg==","user":{"login":"devinbost","id":7418031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTgwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost","html_url":"https://github.com/devinbost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-19T23:34:00Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T23:34:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After restarting different combinations of services, we got the brokers to stop restarting, but none of our functions would get assigned.
