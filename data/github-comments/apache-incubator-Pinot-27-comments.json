Currently the number of controllers/brokers/servers needs to be specified up front, but they can be added/removed during runtime.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3710126/40563111-d22134cc-6020-11e8-9acc-aa6aa8c9d3e9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou had mentioned the Minion instance type- I'm trying to figure out where exactly this ties in.  Am I correct in thinking that the Minion is work still in progress, but will eventually have a PinotAdministrator StartMinion command?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm now looking closer at modeling this all around addInstance per your input.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was thinking the cluster manager backend would listen as a participant when an instance is needed.  But Pinot can't assign instances that don't already exist.  Given that, would addInstance be a new command within PinotAdministrator that would communicate with the cluster manager backend to create the resources?\r\n\r\nExample workflow would be something like-\r\n1. submit application into yarn\r\n2. run AddInstance commands-\r\n  a. AddInstance -instanceType BROKER -tenantName MyTenant -numInstances 2\r\n  b. AddInstance -instanceType SERVER_REALTIME -tenantName MyTenant -numInstances 3\r\n  c. AddInstance -instanceType SERVER_OFFLINE -tenantName MyTenant -numInstances 5\r\n  d. AddInstance -instanceType MINION -tenantName MyTenant -numInstances 1\r\n\r\nAfter running that you'd have a Pinot cluster with 3 controllers, 2 brokers, 3 offline servers, 5 online servers, and 1 minion.  Is my thinking aligned with what you are envisioning?\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/392161201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/392173611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/2850#issuecomment-392173611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/2850","id":392173611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjE3MzYxMQ==","user":{"login":"sunithabeeram","id":3123798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjM3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3123798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram","html_url":"https://github.com/sunithabeeram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunithabeeram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-25T20:30:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T20:30:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM. \r\n\r\nI am not sure about the usage of rethrowException in general.

If one broker goes down, overall qps quota can be shared across the rest of the brokers. So that from users' view, pinot cluster can provide fix overall rate.\r\nIf we use fixed rate for each broker, when one broker goes down, overall rate goes down as well. Since requests get throttled, users will notice the decrease of qps, which's not what they want.\r\nI think the strategy you mention would be total qps / number of replicas(correct me if I'm wrong), which is a fixed rate. So it falls into the 2nd case.\r\nAnd yeah, it'd be great to have more discussions on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/400512235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/400515486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/2922#issuecomment-400515486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/2922","id":400515486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDUxNTQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T01:40:21Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T01:40:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":" max_qps/replicas will be the minimum peak qps a broker will serve when all brokers are up.

In the (longish) email summarizing the issue, I have mentioned the possibility of using a cache that's periodically refreshed. \r\n\r\nWe could perhaps even do with a controller local in-memory cache; if the table size is close to the limit and we are uploading a large chunk, the controller can kick off an ondemand refresh and/or fire off an alert requiring the quota to be reviewed. Anytime we are around 80% of quota usage, its probably good to review and adjust table quota.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/402726989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/403638878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/2936#issuecomment-403638878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/2936","id":403638878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzYzODg3OA==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T22:21:24Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T22:21:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Like the idea of coming up with some sort of list. But looking at the previous/current query is probably to short. We can instead maintain an access count for the segments in the last X minutes and load the top ones until we hit the physical memory limit * some X percent.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to pre-fetch only part of the segments such as dictionary and inverted index, star tree since they are accessed entirely for every query. Forward index can be skipped since the part of forward index accessed depends on the actual values in the query.\r\n\r\nAlso, what are the scenarios where this will be helpful.
