When most tests on a module all complete in < 1 sec, but one of them takes up to 30 sec (and it's out of our control), the 30 sec test can be marked with `@pytest.mark.slow` and that helps to skip it

I am just not sure if we know what we name 'slow' and what is 'not slow' - so it would be great to discuss it and agree before we introduce such marker. Maybe we want to make \"very-slow\". \"slow\", \"slowish\" or something :). \r\n\r\nI saw projects using different strategies and naming (for example t-shirt sizes S, M, L, XL, XXL) or \"big\", \"medium\", \"small\". \r\n\r\nWhat I am here for is to clearly define what such markers are and what exactly we want to achieve by having them rather than introduce them first and think about how to use them later. For me introducing a term without explaining what's the context, how we are going to use it and what we want to achieve is adding noise rather than solving problem.\r\n\r\nFor example I'd say we want to have a goal \"all fast tests together  should run under 2 minutes\" (this is just an example) or \"we want to have all the tests marked as slow if they run > 2 seconds\".  And the timing summary presented by pytest might be useful to make some predictions and intelligent guesses for those values.\r\n\r\n@dazza-codes : Just as example you can take a look at the proposal I made in the discussion at the devlist where I explained not only what markers i propose, but also how they fit in the current development environment we have, how I think we use the markers and what I want to achieve by adding those markers.  \r\n\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/4538437c96f599766005ba7829d0bee1511debb4f53599e0d300a56f%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nSince we are an Apache Project all such discussions should happen in the devlist when they are affecting all community - so I encourage you to add proposal, context and explanation there - so that others can at least have a chance to see it and comment. I think discussing it in PR is not enough - as it affects all contributors. We are talking about something potentially everyone will use.\r\n\r\nFeel free to continue it in this discussion or start your own thread! Even if you have no concrete vision yet, you can start discussing it there and maybe others will have and join your discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/568903744/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/568917571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6900#issuecomment-568917571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6900","id":568917571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODkxNzU3MQ==","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-25T17:22:51Z","updated_at":"2019-12-25T17:22:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Invalid `default_view` will cause Airflow webserver error.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/568917571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/568918876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6792#issuecomment-568918876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6792","id":568918876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODkxODg3Ng==","user":{"login":"shlomiken","id":32815285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODE1Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32815285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken","html_url":"https://github.com/shlomiken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shlomiken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-25T17:48:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-25T17:48:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @ashb -

change introduces a new behaviour (logout after 60 minutes).  While it is good for  security reasons (obviously) the UI of Airflow has a little bit different use patterns/characteristics than typical user-facing apps. \r\n\r\nIt's mostly internal use, with very small number of users, it's already behind a VPN and I guess often witht some kind of client certificates being verified by web seervers.

In many cases UI of Airflow can be used in a fashion similar to \"operational dashboard\" rather than the typical case of \"login/do something/logout\".\r\n\r\nSince we have no auto-refresh yet, using Airflow as dashboard with 60 minutes logout session would not be super user-friendly. \r\n\r\nI'd love to hear what others think about it, but I believe at the very least UPDATING.md should mention that new behaviour if we agree this is a good thing to introduce 60 minutes (or another period) timeout.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569238068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569239369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6909#issuecomment-569239369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6909","id":569239369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTIzOTM2OQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-27T10:18:04Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T10:18:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agree with @nuclearpinguin.

It's also for inner one. Companies may use more than one instance of airflow. For example I have airflow install unique for HR data - this is extremely sensitive. I would welcome such feature for this instance but I wouldn't welcome it for my other airflow instances.\r\n\r\nSo I think this shouldn't be enforced for everyone.\r\nThis can be optional feature that users can set by themselves from `airflow.cfg`\r\nI also recommend not to hard code 60 min. Let users decide what they want. It can be in the same setting:\r\n\r\n`force_log_out_after = 60` if set this will timeout the session and also use the number to determine the

@RosterIn with security. Internal security should not be neglected. \r\n\r\nIt's just that security is never an on/off switch and \"let's apply all the possible security practices\" is not always best choice.\r\n\r\nThere are often multiple layers of security in different places so this logout might not be needed (for example when you have individual client certificates individually issued to your users and verified in proxy standing in front of Airflow.). This is often case in corporate environments (such as Airflow often is installed at) but almost unheard of in public-facing websites.\r\n\r\nThere is always a delicate balance \"convenience vs. security\" and sometimes enforcing some \"best practices\" for security with some inconveniences built in gives the opposite result. People tend to bypass security inconveniences by introducing even more insecure workarounds. For example in this case, I can very easily imagine a data engineer wanting a dashboard installing \"auto-refresh\" browser plugin to refresh the airflow dashboard every 20 minutes. Been there, done that. Such plugins are often vectors of attack on their own.\r\n\r\nSo yeah I agree with force_log_out_after conf value. I think having a separate conf entry for that is much better choice and gives freedom to admins to set their policy rules as they find best for their users.
