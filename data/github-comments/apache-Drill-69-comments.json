Before I comment on the code itself, I'll share some background info. As you'll see, this issue has a long history, and is more complex than it may first appear.\r\n\r\nThe term \"plugin\" in Drill is very ambiguous so it helps to define what we mean. The terms I tend to use are:\r\n\r\n* Plugin module: The jar file which implements a \"plugin\". This is the Java code shared by all \"instances.\"\r\n* Plugin config: The JSON bits stored in ZK that configures a plugin. Any one plugin modules can have 0, 1 or many plugin configs. The configs have a name such as \"cp\" or \"dfs\".\r\n* Plugin instance: A Java object, instantiated from code in the plugin module, configured by one plugin config. This is what actually does work.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this PR wants to handle the case where a new version of Drill adds new plugin modules, and we want to add new plugin configs to match.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there is supposed to be code to handle this case, added a couple of years back. There is some kind of upgrade file that each plugin can provide; the contents of which are copied into ZK (persistent store) on the first restart after the upgrade. I say \"supposed to\" because it was not clear to me, when I reworked the plugin registry, that the code actually worked; it seemed to have some bugs. See below.\r\n\r\nOne thing to remember, however, is that users can add their own plugins. If I release the \"WhizBang\" plugin module via my own project, you may want to add it to your existing Drill installation. We need a way that Drill notices the new plugin module, and adds the corresponding plugin configs.\r\n\r\nWe must also remember the ways that people run Drill:\r\n\r\n* Single node \"cluster\" on a laptop, say. This is the \"learning/testing\" mode. Plugin configs reside in a ZK on that same machine.\r\n* Embedded Drill. Plugin configs are either deleted after each run, or reside in the file system. If run under Docker, plugin state is lost on each restart (unless one does some fancy file system mappings.)\r\n* Distributed Drill. Multiple Drill servers, each with their own copy of the software, run on separate servers, but share the same plugin configs in ZK.\r\n\r\nWe'd want any plugin upgrade process to work in all three, but certainly in the two \"cluster\" cases.\r\n\r\n### Existing Mechanism\r\n\r\nLet's discuss the existing mechanism. You found the function in the code `upgradeStore()`. As I recall, it uses a very weak method to detect the need to upgrade. If a release adds a new plugin, or changes an existing one, the release should include a special file: `ExecConstants.UPGRADE_STORAGE_PLUGINS_FILE` or `drill.exec.storage.upgrade.storage`. If that file exists, plugins are upgraded. If not, no action is taken. Once the upgrade is done, the code deletes the file.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade itself consists of copying a special file from the class path into ZK. (Checking the code, I think it is the file mentioned above: if it exists, we copy it to ZK and delete it.)\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this is a very unreliable, hacky solution. First, if Drill is reinstalled, plugins are again upgraded. Second, since Drill is (supposed to be) distributed, every Drillbit will find it has a local copy of the file and they will all compete to do the upgrade, perhaps overwriting one another's work. Third, if Drill is run embedded (not a job for which it was designed), then state is not persistent (unless the user plays tricks) and only the first run after install will try to do the upgrade. Fourth, if the Drill files are read-only (for security reasons), the file can't be deleted and the upgrade will happen on every restart.\r\n\r\nSee `ClassicConnectorLocator.updatedPlugins()` which calls `PluginBootstrapLoaderImpl.updatedPlugins()`.\r\n\r\nThe \"Classic\" bit, by the way, is meant to be Drill's current plugin mechanism. The ideas was we would add a Presto-like SPI mechanism as well. Didn't quite get that far...\r\n\r\nIt is not clear, by the way, that this mechanism was ever actually tested, or that Drill developers know how to use it. It seems to have been quietly added to solve one specific use case. This is an example of why we need reviews, and tend to want a good solution: otherwise someone has to clean up the mess later.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThe  solution proposed in this PR is OK, but it is cumbersome and probably usable only in your one use case.\r\n\r\nHaving a command-line option may work OK for an embedded Drill, but it is very awkward in a distributed environment, such as under K8s. In that case, we'd want exactly one Drillbit to take the option, and then only once. It is very difficult to configure that in either \"stock\" K8s or under Helm. The mechanism also won't work for any remaining MapR customers using the MapR management console.\r\n\r\nFurther, that PR adds a second incomplete mechanism. Do we support both? Only one?\r\n\r\n### Recommended Solution\r\n\r\nThe proper solution is to adopt a distributed systems approach. Maintain a version in ZK for each plugin module. If the ZK version is lower than the code version, upgrade that plugin. If the code contains a plugin that is not listed in the ZK version table, add it. if the ZK version table has a plugin not in the code, remove it. If the ZK version is newer than the code, fail with an error, or skip that plugin. (Right now, Drill fails with a cryptic crash in this case. We've all spent fun-filled hours trying to track down this problem.)\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, back up the whole ZK before taking actions. The plugin versions would *NOT* be the Drill version, since third-party plugins would not follow the Drill release cycle, nor would Drill releases work during development. Instead, the version number would be a simple integer per plugin. For example, the MapRDB plugin might forever be at 1, while a more active plugin might be at 5.\r\n\r\nA compromise might be to have a version per plugin, but a single version number for the complete ZK persistent store. Such a solution works for Drill-provided plugins: each Drill release bumps the version. But, it won't work for third-party plugins because they won't be able to change the global version in a consistent way.\r\n\r\nDoing this was on the list of plugin enhancements I was working on when doing the plugin storage project. But, \"Phase II\" never came, so this is an open issue available for someone else to pick up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/833088946/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/833600796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2216#issuecomment-833600796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2216","id":833600796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzYwMDc5Ng==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T15:10:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T15:10:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> +1\r\n\r\nDid you mean to approve this?

How are you actually running the tests?\r\n\r\nI use Intellij.   I'd recommend it as I got it to work pretty easily and I'm not a java dev.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have completely built Drill on the cli (`mvn clean install -DskipTests`) before you run unit tests.  In theory this shouldn't matter, but sometimes i get random errors if I don't do that after switching branches.  The error message suggests that the runner can't connect to Drill, which is strange.  I don't think it matters, but I'd also recommend not having any drillbits or any drill-related processes running when you run the unit tests.  I'm only 32.924% sure about this but having Drill running might affect the ports that the tests are using. \r\n\r\nIf that specific unit test isn't working, try one of the simple ones in the `contrib` folder.  Some thing simple like one of the tests for the `Excel` reader.   If that works then you know your environment is capable of running tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/850410311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/850416329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2238#issuecomment-850416329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2238","id":850416329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDQxNjMyOQ==","user":{"login":"cdmikechen","id":12069428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDY5NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12069428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen","html_url":"https://github.com/cdmikechen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-28T13:23:40Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T13:24:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cgivre \r\nYes, I've build whole project.\r\nI choose a contrib hive-storage and run test case in drill but it looks like run failed again.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn test -pl contrib/storage-hive/core\r\n```\r\n\r\nlog\r\n\r\n```\r\nHive Session ID = efd0bb19-db4a-4143-8dd8-f59f79de6e10\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.drill.exec.fn.hive.TestHiveUDFs\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.09 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.drill.exec.fn.hive.TestHiveUDFs\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.drill.exec.fn.hive.TestHiveUDFs  Time elapsed: 0.014 s  <<< ERROR!\r\norg.apache.drill.exec.rpc.RpcException: CONNECTION : io.netty.channel.ConnectTimeoutException: connection timed out: xxx.local/ip:31010\r\nCaused by: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: io.netty.channel.ConnectTimeoutException: connection timed out: xxx.local/ip:31010\r\nCaused by: io.netty.channel.ConnectTimeoutException: connection timed out: xxx.local/ip:31010\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/850416329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/850419390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2238#issuecomment-850419390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2238","id":850419390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDQxOTM5MA==","user":{"login":"cdmikechen","id":12069428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDY5NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12069428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen","html_url":"https://github.com/cdmikechen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdmikechen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-28T13:28:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T13:28:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By the way, I build drill project in my macbook and jdk1.8. \r\nWill a built-in drill service be started during testing?

We use drill in a k8s cluster base on a helm using https://github.com/Agirish/drill-helm-charts. Can we merge this project directly into drill or create an operator to deploy drill? According to this helm, I also made some configuration and content modification and adaptation in the actual operation (like add `daemonsets` mode).\r\nMeanwhile this leads to another problem, how to use environment variables to modify the configuration more conveniently. And how to adjust the level of related logs more conveniently, so that users can use docker to start the container more directly.\r\n2. Is it possible for drill to support Apache Atlas or Apache Ranger? Users maybe will make better use of drill for data processing and analysis by using Ranger to do unified management of data permissions or using Atlas to obtain metadata.\r\n3. Have we some examples or documents about using drill to query alluxio or ozone?
