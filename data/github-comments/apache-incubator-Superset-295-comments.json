Good catch @elukey 👍 Are you using the legacy druid connector or the sqlalchemy one?\r\n\r\nGood question, I am not entirely sure how to check but I suspect the legacy one, I don't see any sqlalchemy configuration for Druid clusters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/609071452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/609100293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9080#issuecomment-609100293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9080","id":609100293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTEwMDI5Mw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-04T22:54:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-04T22:54:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

Also, a big concern about a push to \"custom components\", rather than more standardized open source components provided with the open source kit now.  Statements by @rusackas \"whittling away react-bootstrap using custom components\" and by @ktmud \"if we are to build all UI components by ourselves\" suggest that this is what is underway.   @rusackas \"The implementation of this SIP should iterate toward deprecating the React-Bootstrap dependency, in favor of bespoke components with custom LESS styles built around this new design system.\"   The comment by @gbrian \"merge SQLAB and Chart Explore\" seems to decomponentize the design; it does not retain separation of GUI concerns for the user.  \r\n\r\nDeprecating major technologies like React-Bootstrap in the name of \"simplification\" for developers will introduce yet another reactive framework, and delay the user community getting a version 1.0 product.  It adds a lot of complexity for end users who just want to stand up something quickly that scales in performance and functioality, and is highly usable.  \r\n\r\nThis complete redesign completely torpedoes a lot of standard functionality provided \"out of the box\" that is required to almost effortlessly stand up a running system with minimal effort.  We want a completely working system that includes all servers, subsystems, data connectors, and a decent looking GUI that requires NO customization to get running, and provides tool to customize from a working system.  \r\n\r\nThis product has been \"incubating\" for several years already.  The proposed redesign will require Apache \"re-incubation\" for another year or two.    If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  \r\n\r\nWhat is really going on here?  It appears like commercial professional software consultancies wanting to add complexity to a product to guarantee job security for staff, or perhaps guaranteeing that SuperSet v1.0 never finishes incubating, and always requires experts to set up.  This is reminiscent of the ways that Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft wage in IEEE, ASTM, and ISO fight standards wars by putting technical staff on IEEE, ASTM, and ISO standards committees to guarantee that a standard specification is never implemented.  The likely culprits in this advanced analytics and business intelligence open source war for software are Tableau, Tibco, Microsoft, and other BI advanced analytics vendors who don't want more open source competition.  They would love to stall Superset more or less permanently.  \r\n\r\nUsers DO NOT WANT a complex expert-driven procedure to stand up a Superset system or tailor it.   \r\n\r\nWe need a SIMPLER process to stand up a Superset instance, NOT MORE COMPLEX.   We need a simple one-step installation to get up and running and configuring \"sensible default\" dashboards.  Something as simple as \"docker pull\" followed by \"docker run\", point your browser here, and open your first visualization.  \r\n\r\nRemember to target end users (analysts and dashboard assemblers, not programmers) in 95% of all work that you do, because that's who going to be using it the most.  \r\n\r\nFinish incubating and shipping v1.x of SuperSet before a doing total redesign.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/609516790/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/609518256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9448#issuecomment-609518256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9448","id":609518256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTUxODI1Ng==","user":{"login":"jay-finn","id":49882088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODgyMDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49882088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn","html_url":"https://github.com/jay-finn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jay-finn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T01:08:36Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T01:08:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For anyone who runs into a similar issue, I resolved this by overriding the `User` class from `flask_appbuilder.security.sqla.models`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom flask_appbuilder.security.sqla.models import User\r\nfrom sqlalchemy import (\r\n    Column,\r\n    String\r\n)\r\nclass CustomUser(User):\r\n    __tablename__ = \"ab_user\"\r\n    time_zone = Column(String(64))\r\n```\r\nThis adds `time_zone` to the schema for `ab_user`.\r\nAfter this, override the `add_user` function from class `SupersetSecurityManager`.
