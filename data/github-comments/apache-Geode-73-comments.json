I'll answer in three parts.\r\n\r\nFirst, these types of `Function` implementations give the same ID on JDK 8, 11, and 17:\r\n- Non-local concrete classes (those defined outside a method)\r\n- Local classes (those defined within a method)\r\n- Anonymous classes\r\n- Lambda expressions\r\n\r\nI believe those cover all of the typical ways users will implement Functions. \r\n\r\nSecond, the [javadoc for Class on JDK 17](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Class.html) says\r\n> All kinds of class, including enum classes and record classes, may be hidden classes; all kinds of interface, including annotation interfaces, may be hidden interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis presents the problematic possibility that all three of these conditions could be true:\r\n- The function uses the default `getId()` declared in the `Function` interface.\r\n- The function's class is a kind that has a canonical name on JDK 8 and 11, but is hidden (and therefore has no canonical name) on JDK 17.\r\n- Its `getName()` on JDK 17 returns a value different from its `getCanonicalName()` on JDK 8 and 11.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the function will have a different ID on JDK 17 than on an earlier JDK.\r\n\r\nI do not know under what conditions a class that was non-hidden on earlier JDKs is hidden on JDK 17.\r\n\r\nThird, the problem is worse without this PR. Without this PR, the default `getId()` always returns the class's canonical name. This matters because:\r\n- The class of a `Function` defined as a lambda expression has a meaningful canonical name before JDK 17, but a `null` canonical on JDK 17. Without this PR, lambda functions will always have different IDs on JDK 17 than on earlier JDKs.\r\n- The class of a `Function` defined as an anonymous class has a `null` canonical name on all JDKs. Without this PR, anonymous `Functions` will always have a `null` ID on all JDKs.\r\n\r\nWe will (separately) improve the Geode documentation of to more strongly recommend overriding `getId()` to return a reliable identifier, and to stress the importance of verifying that each `Function` implementation (whether it uses the default `getId()` or a custom one) yields the same ID on all JDKs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1082189286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1082213175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7391#issuecomment-1082213175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7391","id":1082213175,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV85AgUM3","user":{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-29T18:08:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T18:08:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Has test coverage been added for the changes in this PR?

Lines 675-678 in WanCopyRegionCommandDUnitTest are checking that no events are left in B's gateway sender to be sent to C (this is something that was happening before the fix because the gateway sender in B was not started). Now gateway sender is started and so the check at the end of test case `testSuccessfulExecution()` will now correctly verify that callbacks are not invoked in B (which would have been provoked that events had been propagated to C).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1082213175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/1082232603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/7478#issuecomment-1082232603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7478","id":1082232603,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV85AgY8b","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-29T18:27:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T18:27:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like this changes the default bind address to 127.0.0.1.
