Yes, I am still working on this but was distracted by something else before. I will work on this this weekend and get it done. \n\nI tried with 50K segments, and it took about 11 seconds to load all the segments without time index, and about 30 seconds with the time index.\n\nI ran a bunch of tests on different machines. It seems that the machine I originally ran the tests on has some disk issue. A stably reproduceable result was that loading the segments took 3-4x longer with the time index. And what interesting is that for some of the logs with small number of log segments (e,g 100) I saw the loading time is significantly longer than other logs with much more segments (e.g. 3000). This happened both w/ and w/o time index. I am trying to see what caused this. \n\nI'll update the findings this

Is the loading time affected by # of log segments, but not by the size of log segments? It seems that loading the time index is still more expensive than the offset index?

In the constructor of LogSegment, we call timeIndex.lastEntry twice unnecessarily.\n   /\\* The maximum timestamp we see so far */\n   @volatile private var maxTimestampSoFar = timeIndex.lastEntry.timestamp\n   @volatile private var offsetOfMaxTimestamp = timeIndex.lastEntry.offset\n2.

In addition, in the sanity check one difference for time index is that we also check that the last indexed timestamp is greater than the first indexed timestamp. The requires reading both the first and last entry. I also commented out that check.\n\nThe broker that used to have > 40000 segments has only 12000 segments now due to the retention. So I was not able to run the tests on the 40000 partitions. I started to populate data to the cluster again. Hopefully I will have >40000 segments by tomorrow. \n\nOne promising experiment I did this afternoon was changing the number of log recovery threads. This seems reduce the mmap time effectively. But since I do not have a 40000-segments broker this afternoon, it is hard to say if that is going to help in a large broker. I'll try this out tomorrow.\n\nBack to the tests I ran earlier on a 40000 segments broker and this afternoon, the profiling I did was the following:\n1. the time used to load each partition \n2. the time used for mmap function specifically to see if there is long mmap (>100 ms)\n3. the time used in sanity check.\n\nThe profiling shows time spent on (1) is not completely related to the # of segments in the partition. For example, a partition with 1 segment may takes 35 ms to load while another partition with 12 segments only takes 4 ms to load. Even for the two partitions of the same topic that have the exact same number of segments, the time can differ by 10x from 5 ms to 50 ms. **This happens both with and without time index.**\n\nWhen I look at the partitions that takes longer to load (e.g. 2 seconds w/o time index and 6 seconds w/ time index), those segments tend to be loaded later in the segment loading process.\n\nAs for time spent on (2), I did not see any long mmap when the number of segments is less than 12000, whether with or without time index. But after the # of segments is greater than 20000, some long mmap() are witnessed. Again, those long mmap call only occur on the log segments that are loaded later in the segment loading process. The loading time was pretty linear when number of segments is 12000. It took about 2 seconds to load the segments without time index, and took about 4 seconds with time index.\n\nRegarding the time spent on (3), when we have to read both the first timestamp and last timestamp in the time index, the sanity check time significantly grew, but still short compared with the time spent on loading the files.\n\nBased on the test I have run, it seems clear that\n1. The biggest part of segment loading time is mmap(), no matter w/ or w/o time index.\n2. It does not seem that loading time index is more expensive than loading offset index.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/239713049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/239716267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1737#issuecomment-239716267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1737","id":239716267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTcxNjI2Nw==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T02:16:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T02:16:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Originally the test set a timeout of 1ms to exercise the purgatory code path.

there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/239872879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/239875732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1740#issuecomment-239875732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1740","id":239875732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTg3NTczMg==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T17:54:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T17:54:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/239875732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/239890369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1530#issuecomment-239890369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1530","id":239890369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTg5MDM2OQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T18:43:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T18:43:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comments

Looks good to me overall. Just a few minor comments. \n\nOne thing I was thinking is on loading the partial segment into the map. I was originally thinking that if we can load at least one full segment into the map, we will still move the dirty offset at the segment boundary to avoid having to scan the partial segment more than once.  On second thought, your approach in the patch potentially requires fewer rounds of cleaning.
