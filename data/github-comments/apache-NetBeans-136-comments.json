Now I understand why this error type was marked with a different style than in other file types (without a wavy red underline): because the editor wasn't really marking an error.\r\n\r\n> It might be good to mark the syntax error as well, but that's not what you're seeing here as such.\r\n\r\nI agree. That would be useful. After all it's also a syntax error.\r\n\r\nI've just realized that other syntax errors are indeed properly marked as such. For example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<root>\r\n\t<foo&foo/>\r\n</root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the editor properly marks `&` and `/` as errors. However, there are not red stripes in the right margin of the editor nor error messages in the _Action items_ panel. If you've scrolled down/up, and the error is in a line out of the visible area, you won't ever see the error.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1303060322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1303182491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4792#issuecomment-1303182491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4792","id":1303182491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5NrPyb","user":{"login":"Richard7111","id":94047859,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZsOcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94047859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111","html_url":"https://github.com/Richard7111","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Richard7111/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-04T09:43:18Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T09:43:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mbien, I managed to fix the bugs, feel free to check it out.

It's just a one-line change, but there is more than one version of the `xml.xsd` file available from the W3C. The current local copy in the build appears to work for all versions of J2EE 1.4, JavaEE 5-8, and Jakarta 9, but perhaps we should replace it with the latest version.\r\n\r\nSee the section \"Versioning policy for this schema document\" at the very bottom of the page at [Schema document for namespace http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace](https://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd).\r\n\r\n> I wondered why you were hitting this problem - first time I've looked at strictly-netbeans - interesting!\r\n\r\nYes, I was very surprised to get it working at all!

The reason why the project ends in a corrupted stat is that for newer Java EE and Jakarta EE versions, it uses the same archetype for all generated Maven modules. And the archteype generates a WAR module. Therefore we'll get a WAR module, with multiple nested WAR modules. This is not only wrong but invalid, because the top-level module isn't POM but WAR.\r\n\r\nIf we decide that Netbeans won't support EAR project generation for newer Jakarta EE versions, we should then remove the archetype for the newer versions of Jakarta EE in https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/f0ed696648470561d9e05c03db965812893b3f51/enterprise/maven.j2ee/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/j2ee/ui/wizard/archetype/J2eeArchetypeFactory.java#L118, so that users can choose the newer versions and get a corrupted project.\r\n\r\nIt should be reasonably easy to add support for EAR though, by adding appropriate archetypes, because they are very simple. The source code repository for old archetypes at codehaus.org is gone, however, their source code is still available in Maven Central and we can loosely base the new archtypes on that (but not simply fork it, because it's not released under any opensource license AFAIK). I can have a look into this. @juneau001, would it be OK to contribute to your repository for the WEB archetype? Or better to do it in my own repo/fork and release the new archetypes to Maven Central by myself? Or maybe, even better, join the [Eclipse Starter](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/starter) project, which already provides some Jakarta EE archetypes?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1304764350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1304767511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3723#issuecomment-1304767511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3723","id":1304767511,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5NxSwX","user":{"login":"OndroMih","id":2195988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTU5ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2195988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih","html_url":"https://github.com/OndroMih","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OndroMih/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-06T10:22:51Z","updated_at":"2022-11-06T10:22:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is because the archetype used by Netbeans generates a WAR maven module in the root project and not a parent POM module.

At first sight I don't think it's reasonable from Gradle's point of view, since e.g. NB gets 'under the hood' of an initialized Plugin. Gradle is perfectly willing to find a Plugin by name or class, but is less willing to map the Plugin (class) back to the ID - I don't believe there's a real use-case for that in gradle itself.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Gradle APIs are designed so when you ask for a value, it's computed if it does not exist yet, even though it means to run some tasks that might compile or produce resources to get that value. This is what makes perfect sense for any buildtime query, but the IDE must avoid (and break into) such encapsulation.\r\n\r\nBut overall, it's nothing more than introspection of a state effective at the start of the buildscript = statically configured values.\r\n\r\n(sorry for the close; I hit the button accidentally)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1306168612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1306205702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4710#issuecomment-1306205702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4710","id":1306205702,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5N2x4G","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T21:18:28Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T21:18:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Once https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4792 merges I'll submit a PR which does a few changes in related areas in ActionUtils.\r\n\r\nMost likely you'd need a new action similar to CloseAllButThisAction and CloseAllDocumentsAction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1306205702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1306250347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4923#issuecomment-1306250347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4923","id":1306250347,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5N28xr","user":{"login":"errael","id":20450427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwNDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael","html_url":"https://github.com/errael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T21:50:18Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T21:50:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> At first sight I don't think it's reasonable from Gradle's point of view, since e.g. NB gets 'under the hood' of an initialized Plugin\r\n\r\nIs the information that NB examines something that most IDEs would (might) want to look at?

But - it's the user who should decide. Based on my experience, both scenarios are valid:\r\n- compile on the JDK set as compile target (which could be the default, **provided that** such JDK is installed and set up as Java platform)\r\n- compile on user-chosen JDK *different* from the compilation target: the user may want to use e.g. extended syntax, especially with newer javacs that compile against exact target's JDK API set.\r\n\r\nWe do not have a separate setting for the (external, forked) build tool though - and such setting might be useful even for Maven.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1306981881/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1307014988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4925#issuecomment-1307014988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4925","id":1307014988,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5N53dM","user":{"login":"RubbleMonkey","id":67176998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTc2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67176998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey","html_url":"https://github.com/RubbleMonkey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RubbleMonkey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-08T10:54:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T10:54:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@neilcsmith-net thanks!
