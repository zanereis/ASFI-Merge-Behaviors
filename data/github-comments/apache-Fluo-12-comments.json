I'm not a fan of skipping ITs in Travis CI for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It means less testing,\r\n2. It encourages more ITs over UTs when a faster UT would be appropriate, simply because we aren't as aware of the running cost ITs have as we would be if they ran all the time, and\r\n3. It's most likely indicative of a bad test.\r\n\r\nI think we should try to find a way to make the ITs work in Travis.\r\n\r\nAs for skipping the `accumulo-maven-plugin`, it's probably best to tie that to `-DskipITs`, rather than `-DskipTests` anyway.

I am not sure what the best solution is when multiple people would like to work on the same issue.  I think the simplest thing to do is just directly ask the person who expressed interest if they are currently working on the issue or plan to shortly.  For my part I can keep looking through the code and finding things that need addressing and open more issues.  I just opened #938  as another help wanted issue.\r\n\r\nI was thinking we could take the approach that Fluo takes and use optimistic locking (first person to get a PR accepted), but that seems a bit anti-social so I vetoed that idea in my head.  I think its better to just discuss, although I know that can be a bit annoying sometimes because you have to wait 24 to 48 hours for a response. I am not sure how to speed up the process and make it civil, so personally I would like to see a civil process.

In the while loop in the seek method, need to use the timestampskipping iterator to jump ahead.   When the colType is TX_DONE, can do the following :\r\n\r\n ```java\r\n      if (colType == ColumnConstants.TX_DONE_PREFIX) {\r\n        # jump to WRITE skipping all TX_DONE\r\n        source.skipToPrefix(curCol, ColumnConstants.WRITE_PREFIX);\r\n      } else if (colType == ColumnConstants.WRITE_PREFIX) {\r\n ```\r\n\r\nFor `WRITE_PREFIX` we can jump ahead to `DEL_LOCK_PREFIX` when lockTime > timePtr.  For `DEL_LOCK_PREFIX` we can jump to `LOCK_PREFIX` when lockTime > ts.\r\n\r\nThe background on this is that the column prefixs are in sorted order (descending sort of signed long and the prefix is the 1st three bits).   There could be lots of column prefixes and once we determine that nothing else in the current prefix is useful then we can seek to the next possible prefix.  This has the potential to seek over a lot of prefixes.   The code is currently doing a linear scan of all column prefixes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/339804489/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/339957727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/956#issuecomment-339957727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/956","id":339957727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTk1NzcyNw==","user":{"login":"kennethmcfarland","id":29900332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTAwMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29900332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland","html_url":"https://github.com/kennethmcfarland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennethmcfarland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-27T12:29:11Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T12:29:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner I am glad you made the decision with the semantics to match the guava api.
