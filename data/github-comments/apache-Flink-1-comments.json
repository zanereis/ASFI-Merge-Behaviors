It now uses the first bit of every byte to indicate whether there is at least one more byte coming. \n\nThis has the bonus that all letters are serialized as one byte (opposed to the previous version which could only do this for the numbers and a few special characters (which actually made the variable length encoding pointless...))\n\n~~I currently do a selective shift starting on the flag positions to make space for them.

think this will be a nice addition to the API.\n\nWould it make sense to rename the operator to flatMapPartition? It might be confusing in relation to the existing map and flatMap functions. Map is a 1:1 mapping wheras a flatMap is the 1:n mapping. The new operator is called `mapParititons`, but is able to collect multiple
