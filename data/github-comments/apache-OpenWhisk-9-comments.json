another term to refer to an activation of a trigger and/or a rule is unnecessary. Generally an activation of a trigger is the \"firing\" of a trigger. And an activation of a rule is the matching a trigger to a rule, causing an action to be invoked. Just as we equate \"invoke\" with activating an action, we can equate \"fire\" of a trigger with an activation of the trigger and possibly a rule.\n\nThe causality of activations chains can also be tracked and I expect this will be helpful in the future - one can build a graph of the activations with edge representing activation causality.\n\nWe currently show activations of triggers, rules and actions in `wsk activation poll` and `wsk activation list`. What we are missing is the \"type\" annotation on the activation and adding this will make it clear which kind of activation occurred.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/219488405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/219490126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/245#issuecomment-219490126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/245","id":219490126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQ5MDEyNg==","user":{"login":"mbehrendt","id":4745697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4745697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt","html_url":"https://github.com/mbehrendt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T17:33:41Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T17:33:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"that is fine with me as a baseline, but two items i think need to be refined:\n- so far, all our collateral has been referring to an activation being equal to an invocation of an action. the rule & trigger flavor has never been discussed.\n- we'll have to often talk about activations in the 'action invocation' sense. using the term 'action activation' seems very clunky, we should look for a short version here (so far that has been activation, but that is now overloaded)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/219490126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/219492058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/245#issuecomment-219492058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/245","id":219492058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQ5MjA1OA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T17:40:49Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T22:25:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Intuition tells me activation will (has) quite often mean (meant) action activation and having to qualify it is not necessary.

agree then, don't we?\n\nThat is, if/when `start = end` (true for triggers/rules) then `duration = 0`. I'll concede that duration equal to zero is not the same as undefined but I am not convinced the distinction is important in this context.\n\nIn any case the proposed solution in the first comment is to make the trigger activation a point in time rather than one that has a duration. So I think the distinction you want to make is about naming an activation with a duration differently from an activation which is instantaneous.\n\nThe common parts of an activation are the fully qualified name, the point in time when it occurred, the subject causing the activation.

re wsk action init -- would it make sense to generalize this one, such that not only a hard-coded code template is used for creating the action, but rather that the user can select which code template should be used (from a catalog of public actions) ?\n\nYes I agree templates are always good entry point to see a demo/tutorial, and the author just provide a template. Usually the easiest would be url like a git url or ID in an openwhisk package registry/catalog\nLike `wsk init --template https://github.com/csantanapr/openwhisk-demo1.git` or `wsk init --template ow-twilio-demo`\n\nif the starting code is already inside the system then I would use `wsk clone namespace1/package1 or wsk clone namespace1/package1/entity1`\n\n> we could call the latter one e.g. wsk clone\n\nYes I like both terms don't know which one to decide `clone` or `fork`. I think `clone` makes more sense since it's just I want a copy, no intention to do SCM and contribute
