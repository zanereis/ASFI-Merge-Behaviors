It takes a multi-item request and makes single item requests out of that and then merges the results back together. Even if it's the fool-proof thing to do, it's by far the least optimal one.\r\n\r\nIn your above case, when using an S7-1200 the result will probably be 4 requests as the max PDU size allows a payload of something around 240 bytes. If you were using an s7-1500 or 400 you might even get all items in one request as their PDU sizes is bigger. \r\n\r\nProblem is ... If we wrote an optimizer for only S7, then we'll run into the same problem elsewhere and we'd be writing the same thing over and over again ... if you feel willing to work on this, I would be happy to assist you.

Java 举例,PLC 使用 KEYENCE KV-7500,读取一个32位有符号整数.\r\n\r\nUsing Java as an example, PLC uses KEYENCE KV-7500 to read a 32-bit signed integer.\r\n\r\nFirst step:\r\n  configuration variables(Device information and register information)\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"devices\": [                      \r\n    {\r\n      \"deviceID\": \"L1:D1\",          // device unique identifier(设备全局唯一编号)\r\n

the configuration, link the device, and automatically collect the data of the PLC and save it to the cache\r\n\r\nSecond step:\r\n  业务代码就可以非常简单,完全不关心plc的链接与通信协议\r\n  My business code can be written like this:\r\n```\r\npublic class Demo{\r\n\r\n  public void onConnectSuccessfully(){\r\n    // connection succeeded (链接成功)\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  public void onConnectFailed(){\r\n   // connection failed

Read the original value, which can default to Byte\r\n    Byte[] raw = tag.getRawData();\r\n    int raw = DataUtils.convert2Int(raw);\r\n    \r\n    // Read mode 2. Directly obtain the value of a specific type\r\n    int raw = tag.getInt();\r\n\r\n    // >>>>> Business logic....save data to database, calculate, judge, etc.\r\n\r\n    // ==== [Optional] write value ===\r\n    tag.write(Byte[] data);\r\n\r\n    // ==== [Optional] Read and write values to other variables ===\r\n    Tag otherTag = TagMangager.getTag(\"key\");\r\n    otherTag.getXXX();\r\n    otherTag.write(Data);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1373326534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
