my perspective is always that of a new easily confused user. (That's\nmy target audience.)  I myself got tired of typing \"IPYTHON=1\" every time I\nstarted pyspark, so I did what I'm guessing most people will do which is to\nset that as an environment variable in my profile.  Which was fine until\nthe first time I tried running a pyspark script.\n\nYour doc change explicitly recommends I not do that, but...well, really?\n It just makes learning pyspark that much more confusing.  The \"pyspark\"\ncommand is going to be most new users' main entry point into this new\ntechnology.\n\nIn the new Spark class I'm working on, which uses mainly Python, I had\nplanned all along to set IPYTHON for the students automatically, because it\nis sooooo much easier working in IPython than vanilla, and so tedious to\nhave to type that in repeatedly (or use command history every time.)\n\nI think what's going to happen is that users will ignore your admonishment\nto explicitly type the variable setting every time they start the shell,\nand set it in their environment...then they will end up scratching their\nheads trying to figure out why their scripts aren't working.  (The error\nthat results is quite non-intuitive for a Spark newbie.)\n\nI can live with it as is (with the doc change) but it isn't a very user\nfriendly thing.\n\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2014 at 12:31 AM, UCB AMPLab notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Merged build finished.

@holdenk, I actually thought of a problem with using Iterator here -- users won't be able to cache() an RDD of Iterators in a meaningful way. (After the first time you read it, all iterators will be exhausted). We should use Iterable instead, both in Scala and in Java. This will make the implementation tougher when we do go to on-disk storage, and we may still have to do special tricks for caching (cause we don't just want to cache an object that knows how to read data across the network), but it's a more appropriate API.\n\nYou should do something equivalent in Python; it already has a concept of iterables (http://www.shutupandship.com/2012/01/understanding-python-iterables-and.html).\n\nCC @rxin, @aarondav in case there are other ideas.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39372516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39372535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/288#issuecomment-39372535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/288","id":39372535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzcyNTM1","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-02T19:24:21Z","updated_at":"2014-04-02T19:24:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

Manish, Evan, Ameet, Ram, and thanks Xiangrui, Matei. It's great to have this PR merged, but I think there is room for a lot of improvement, and I hope this thread is still open for comments. I have some detailed notes from my side, we can track them in a separate place if required.\n\nSome design notes to start with:\n\nThe current design of classes and relationships is good, but I think it would be great if it can be modified slightly to make it similar to the design of other existing algorithms in MLLib and extend the existing interfaces. For example, we can have a `DecisionTreeModel` or that extends the existing `RegressionModel` interface, similar to the existing `RidgeRegressionModel` and `LinearRegressionModel`. Alternatively, we can have separate `ClassificationTreeModel` and `RegressionTreeModel` that extend the existing interfaces `ClassificationModel` and `RegressionModel` respectively.\n\nNote that it is important to keep the `Model` as a class, so that we can later compose ensemble and other composite models consisting of multiple `Model` instances. Currently the decision tree `Node` is essentially the `Model`, although I would prefer a wrapper around it and explicitly called `DecisionTreeModel` that implements methods like `predict`, `save`, `explain`, `load` like I remember coming across in MLI.\n\nIn the file `DecisionTree.scala`, the actual class can be renamed to `DecisionTreeAlgorithm` that extends `Algorithm` interface that implements `train(samples)` and outputs a `RegressionModel`. Note that there is no `Algorithm` interface currently in MLLib, although there may be one in MLI and the closest is `abstract class GeneralizedLinearAlgorithm[M <: GeneralizedLinearModel]`.\n\nModeling `Strategy` should be renamed to `Parameters`. I would prefer a separation between model parameters like depth, minimum gain and algorithm parameters like level-by-level training or caching. The line is blurred for some aspects like quantile strategy, but I am inclined to put those into modeling parameters, so it can be referred to later on. Rule of thumb being that different algorithm parameters should lead to same model (up to randomization effects) for the same model parameters.\n\n`Impurity` should be renamed to `Error` or something more technical. Also see my later comments on the need for a generic `Error` Interface that allow easy adaptation of algorithms for specific loss functions.\n\nIn general, MLLib and MLI should define proper interfaces for `Model`, `Algorithm`, `Parameters` and importantly `Loss` entities, at least for supervised machine learning algorithms and all implementations should adhere to it. Surprisingly, MLLIb or MLI currently doesn't have a `Loss` or `Error` interface, the closest being the `Optimizer` interface. There is also a need for portable model output formats, e.g., JSON, that can be used by other programs, possibly written in other languages outside Scala and Java. Can also use an existing format like PMML (not sure if it's widely used). Lastly, there is a need to support standard data formats with optional delimiter parameters - I am sure this a general need for Spark. I understand there has been significant effort before for standardization, would be good to know about the current status.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39385736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39386577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/305#issuecomment-39386577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/305","id":39386577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzg2NTc3","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-02T21:32:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-02T21:32:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"

terms of running time performance, here are some scalability results for a large scale dataset. Results look satisfactory :).\n\nThe code was tested on a dataset for a binary classification problem. A regression tree with `Variance` (square loss) was trained because it's computationally more intensive. The dataset consists of about `500,000,000` training instances. There are 20 features, all numeric. Although there are categorical features in the dataset and the algorithm implementation supports it, they were not used since the main program doesn't have options.\n\nThe dataset is of size about 90 GB in plain text format. It consists of 100 part files, each about 900 MB. To _optimize_ number of tasks to align with number of workers, the task split size was chosen to be 160 MB to have 300 tasks.\n\nThe model training experiements were done on a Yahoo internal Hadoop cluster. The CPUs are of type Intel Xeon 2.4 GHz. The Spark YARN adaptation was used to run on Hadoop cluster. Both master-memory and worker-memory were set to `7500m` and the cluster was under light to moderate load at the time of experiments. The fraction of memory used for caching was `0.3`,\nleading to about `2 GB` of memory per worker for caching.  The number of workers used for various experiments were `20, 30, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600` to evenly align with 600 tasks. Note that with 20 and 30 workers, only `48%` and `78%` of the 90 GB data could be cached in memory. The decision tree of depth 10 was trained and minor code changes were made to record the individual level training times. The training command (with additional JVM settings) used is\n\n```\ntime \\\nSPARK_JAVA_OPTS=\"${SPARK_JAVA_OPTS} \\\n-Dspark.hadoop.mapred.min.split.size=167772160 \\\n-Dspark.hadoop.mapred.max.split.size=167772160\" \\\n-Dspark.storage.memoryFraction=0.3 \\\nspark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.Client \\\n--queue ${QUEUE} \\\n--num-workers ${NUM_WORKERS} \\\n--worker-memory 7500m \\\n--worker-cores 1 \\\n--master-memory 7500m \\\n--jar ${JARS}/spark_mllib_tree.jar \\\n--class org.apache.spark.mllib.tree.DecisionTree \\\n--args yarn-standalone \\\n--args --algo --args Regression \\\n--args --trainDataDir --args ${DIST_WORK}/train_data_lp.txt \\\n--args --testDataDir --args ${DIST_WORK}/test_data_0p1pc_lp.txt \\\n--args --maxDepth --args 10 \\\n--args --impurity --args Variance \\\n--args --maxBins --args 100\n```\n\nThe training times for training each depth and for each choice of number of workers is in the attachments [workers_times.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hirakendu/temp/master/spark_mllib_tree_pr79_review/workers_times.txt). The attached graphs  demonstrate the scalability in terms of\ncumulative training times for various depths and various number of workers.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hirakendu/temp/master/spark_mllib_tree_pr79_review/workers_times.png)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hirakendu/temp/master/spark_mllib_tree_pr79_review/workers_speedups.png)\n\nFor obtaining the speed-ups, the training times are compared to those for 60 workers, since the data could not be cached completely for 20 and 30 workers. For all experiments, the resources requested\nwere fully allocated by the cluster and all experiments ran to completion in their first and only run.\nAs we can see, the scaling is nearly linear for higher depths 9 and 10, across the range of 60 workers to 600 workers, although the slope is less than 1 as expected. For such loads, 60 to 100 workers are a reasonable computing resource and the total training times are about 160 minutes and 100 minutes respectively. Overall, the performance is satisfactory, in particular when trees\nof depth 4 or 5 are trained for boosting models. But clearly, there is room for improvement in the following sense. The dataset when fully cached takes about 10s for a count operation, whereas the training time for first level that involves simple histogram calculation of three error statistics takes roughly 30 seconds.\n\nThe error performance in terms of RMSE was verified to be close to that of alternate implementations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39390268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39390364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/248#issuecomment-39390364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/248","id":39390364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzkwMzY0","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-02T22:09:47Z","updated_at":"2014-04-02T22:09:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright, let's maybe merge it as is for now.
