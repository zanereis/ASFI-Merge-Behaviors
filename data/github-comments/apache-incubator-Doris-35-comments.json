In current system, sql like select * from table where date in (20201030); date is type of DATE; date and 20201030 will be casted to DOUBLE type. That is not corret. I think the invalid type should be found in Analyze Phase, not be found in phase of 'Pruning Partitions'. This problem will not cause to scan all partitions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/717663446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/717672265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/4753#issuecomment-717672265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4753","id":717672265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzY3MjI2NQ==","user":{"login":"EmmyMiao87","id":25147274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQ3Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25147274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87","html_url":"https://github.com/EmmyMiao87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-28T03:28:07Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T03:28:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

For meta data viewing, just simple use table read lock to replace database read lock.\r\n\r\n2. For meta reading, we don't pursue strong consistency, our goal is to ensure not dead lock and thread safe, such as db.getTable do not need db read lock.\r\n\r\n3. In order to escape dead lock, we keep db lock -> table lock -> other lock, for same meta level, we must sort meta by unique id before lock meta list.\r\n\r\n4. Although db lock to table lock modification is large and difficult to review, but I think the heavy work is Meta modification, which in Alter, Load, Catalog theme, and logic in meta viewing is clear and less error prone.\r\n\r\n5. When change property in one meta, we need to change meta lock, such as load, we only need lock table, but when we change property both in meta and its parent meta, such rename operation, we must lock both db and table\r\n\r\n6. Finally. reduce unneeded lock, such as lock the same meta twice in one operation, reduce the lock scope to reduce the lock competition.

are two main problems here.\r\n\r\n1. The Plan process is inefficient.\r\n\r\nIn the Plan phase, when multiple UNION combinations are encountered, multiple rounds of iteration will increase the plan time. In my test, it may cost 2-3 seconds to analyze and plan a SQL with 30 UNIONs.\r\n\r\n2. Too many Fragments\r\n\r\nA SQL may generate hundreds or thousands of Fragments, and all Fragments are currently sent to the corresponding BE separately. The common fields of these Fragments will undergo multiple serialization and deserialization operations, which results in a very high RPC processing time.\r\nIn my test, a SQL with 30 UNIONs generates 300+ fragments, and total size of these fragments is over 100MB, mainly \r\noccupied by `DescriptorTable`.\r\n\r\nOptimization Strategy:\r\n1. For problem 1, it is necessary to analyze the corresponding code hot spots through the Java Profiler tool to optimize the analysis process. (TODO)\r\n2. For problem 2, multiple fragments sent to the same BE can be merged and sent in batch, reducing the number of RPCs and reducing the amount of data sent.
