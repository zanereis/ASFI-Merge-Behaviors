I'm glad airflow on k8s is getting attention and it has the potential to really improve airflow moving forward. \r\n\r\nThat said, there are a lot of nasty bits when trying to safely schedule jobs on kubernetes (the biggest being how do you ensure a job does not get stuck due to many failure modes like running out of resources, volume mounts failing, incorrect configuration, missing secrets and configmaps, etc etc). The happy path of checking the job status for \"Failed\", \"Running\", or \"Succeeded\" is definitely not enough. \r\n\r\nDue to the many failure modes, I think this PR will explode in size when you try to handle all the cases. (At least, that is what happened at my dayjob when I implemented a KubernetesExecutor).\r\nI think the real solution is breaking out all of those failure modes into a separate kubernetes job runner library, and then using that library inside the KubernetesExecutor. \r\n\r\nThere are other minor issues as well, but they are mainly concerning your implementation and are not fundamental issues (ie: blocking polling, long delay between polling, etc)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to reach out and help contribute what I can if you are interested (pending work approval), as I think getting a KubernetesExecutor in airflow core would help a lot of people.

This implementation is still somewhat immature but It's at least a working POC until I can iterate with feedback from the airflow and kubernetes communities :).\r\n\r\nThe points you're making are valid ones. I am actually meeting with a team of kubernetes committers next Wednesday 10AMPST via video-chat to discuss my progress thusfar and get a better perspective from the kubernetes community.

This is my primary project at my day job, so depending on what the k8s guys say next week, if it takes a week or two of heavy lifting it would still pay off in the long run (and probably offer a cool tool to the rest of the kubernetes community).\r\n\r\nCould you please let me know what other issues you are seeing with my implementation?

I bet they have great perspectives that I or you don't have. \r\n\r\nAbout contributing actual code, I have to wait a bit until I know more about what I am/am not allowed to open source of our internal KubernetesExecutor code. I'm confident it won't be an issue, but just being extra safe.  \r\n\r\nAbout the POC code, here are some high level things that probably need to change outside of just handling job failure modes better:\r\n\r\n1.  More robust way to scale polling for jobstatus. The three main options you have here are:\r\n     a. `ThreadPoolExecutor` running polling for each job in a separate thread (with the caveat of the GIL)\r\n     b. `ProcessPoolExecutor` running polling for each job in a separate process (more overhead)\r\n     c. Use an eventloop (from tornado or asyncio) and run async polling inside the eventloop\r\n2. How much do you want to let people tweak the kubernetes jobs the scheduler launches? In the completely general case, you can dynamically spin up anything from a user-provided config, but you probably don't want this. For me, being able to tweak resource utilization and the docker image that is running are crucial, but for some people always using an `airflow-slave` image is fine. Additionally, do you want  to be able to dynamically change configuration at runtime or just just when the dag is constructed. \r\n3. How logging is handled. This is actually very easy if you have a `readwritemany persistent volume` (ie: something like glusterfs). The airflow workers can just write to the gluster volume that is mounted locally and the web UI will pick up the logs magically. \r\n4. You probably don't need a `task_counter`. Airflow has a built in config parameter `parallelism` that will  automatically rate-limit the number of running task instances (see the BaseExecutor for the implementation)\r\n\r\nI think those are the big ones, other minor things are mostly related to code nitpicks which don't matter much from a POC perspective.

For us, that means configuring the docker image and the resources to run the task with. \r\n\r\nI think in general this is an improvement for airflow since it removes a `CeleryExecutor` specific feature and replaces it with a general configuration field for all executors. \r\n\r\nThis still is only *static* configuration though. If you want truly dynamic configuration you need another mechanism for shared config passing and validation. (We implemented this with row-level locking in Postgres and adding a new config table, but it is ugly). \r\n\r\nWhen I say static vs dynamic configuration I mean:\r\n     static configuration => configuration that you know about when you are writing your dag. \r\n     dynamic configuration => configuration that you know about only when the dag is part-finished \r\n\r\nDynamic configuration is useful if you want to do things like:\r\n- Have a task that counts the number of rows in a hive table\r\n- Based on that count, configure a downstream task to have more/less resources\r\n\r\nAbout 4:\r\nMakes sense. Though if you don't care about readability of IDs you can just use a UUID and call it a day. \r\n\r\nAnd great, I'm excited to talk with you all and learn more about kubernetes and airflow :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/313818852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/313819330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2425#issuecomment-313819330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2425","id":313819330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzgxOTMzMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-08T00:04:38Z","updated_at":"2017-07-08T00:05:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2425](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/0fc45045a27a0b1867410613d6c0edba820e3abf?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.04%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425/graphs/tree.svg?height=150&token=WdLKlKHOAU&src=pr&width=650)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #2425      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   69.24%   69.28%   +0.04%     \n==========================================\n  Files         146      146              \n  Lines       11230    11230              \n==========================================\n+ Hits         7776     7781       +5     \n+ Misses       3454     3449       -5\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `87.31% <0%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `75.45% <0%> (+0.4%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2425?src=pr&el=footer).

Here are some of my thoughts when I was designing the abstraction:\r\nFrom a high-level perspective, the system needs to provide three major logging operations (use airflow worker as an example):\r\n\r\n1. Setup airflow logging before task run such as adding log handlers\r\n2. Clean up / additional operations once worker finished the task, if any, like uploading to cloud storage\r\n3. Query logs and display on Airflow UI\r\n\r\nLet's take the current Airflow logging as an example for each of the above steps:\r\n\r\n1. Worker configures logging before each task run based on whether it's raw mode. It output logs to stdout if raw mode otherwise it logs to a file named dag_id-task_id-execution_date.\r\n2. Once the task is finished, the log can be optionally uploaded to S3 or GCS.\r\n3. Webserver queries the log by referring to the file named dag_id-task_id-execution_date. It first checks S3/GCS. If not loaded, it directly fetches the log from the remote worker machine.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to use conf to represent all those situations without making user implementing the interface?

'[%(server_time)s] %(message)s',\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    'handlers': {\r\n        'console': {\r\n            'level': 'INFO',\r\n            'filters': ['require_debug_true'],\r\n            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\r\n        },\r\n        'airflow.task': {\r\n            'level': 'INFO',\r\n            'class': 'airflow.utils.log.TaskHandler',\r\n            'formatter': 'airflow.task',\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    'loggers': {\r\n        'django.server': {\r\n            'handlers': ['airflow.task'],\r\n            'level': 'INFO',\r\n            'propagate': False,\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `TaskHandler` could be `S3TaskHandler` if needed. The `S3TaskHandler` could/should overwrite the \"flush\" / \"close\" methods in order to do clean ups and if really needed maybe the `createLock` or `acquire` lock methods. It could also derive from RotatingFileHandler to move the log to S3 at a certain point in time.\r\n\r\nIn the TaskHandler you can then use something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def handle(self, record):\r\n        msg = record.msg\r\n        task_try = getattr(record, 'task_try', None)\r\n        execution_date = getattr(record, 'execution_date', None)\r\n        dag_id = getattr(record, 'execution_date', None)\r\n\r\n       do_something(xx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing it this way allows us to continue to use `import logging` and use the standard frameworks. It also gets rid of file opening in airflow itself for logging and all those messy bits. next to that, it is a simpler path for your internship as TaskHandler can be implemented quite independently from the rest, i.e. it is not necessary to overhaul everything cause the importing of the handler will get dependent on what `logging.getLogger('XXX')` gives back. This will be the default Handler when it is an arbitrary place, but will be `logging.getLogger('airflow.task')` in case of a task.\r\n\r\nTo get the location of the log (and to display it in the UI) several options exist, but I could imagine that you would extend the TaskHandler with a `read(task_id, dag_id, execution_date)` method that returns the contents for all tries or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures that you only have to create two new classes in your case (I guess you are using S3) airflow.utils.log.TaskHandler and airflow.utils.log.S3TaskHandler. And some adjustments to configure_logging and to TaskInstance in models.py to obtain the right logger. Maybe also to the some of the operators if they are miss behaving (ie. not using the default handler), but I just checked I do not think works needs to be done there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/314762876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/314780798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2378#issuecomment-314780798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2378","id":314780798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDc4MDc5OA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T14:09:21Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T14:09:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch ping.

Here is my understanding of TaskHandler class:  it should at least have the following methods:\r\n\r\n1. handle(record) \r\n2. Flush / close: operations done once task finishes running\r\n3. Read: read the log given task_id, dag_id and execution_date. We can get the log by using logging.getLogger('airflow.task').handlers[<handler_number>].read(task_instance)\r\n\r\nI am still confused about how to address questions that's in current Airflow logging:\r\n\r\n1. TaskHandler can handle each log line but how can it be setup before each task run? (like using the task_instance information to create directories if needed and give them correct permissions)\r\n2.  How to differentiate between logging to stdout and file given different args.raw value?\r\n3. In handle method,  currently airflow record does not have information like task_id, dag_id. This requires additional change to current logger.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, TaskHandler with configuration is a lot more complex and less extensible than having one interface. \r\n\r\n1. handle + init handler for each task run → setup_logging(ti)\r\n2. flush/close/acquire_lock → post_logging(ti)\r\n3. read → get_task_log(ti)\r\n4. getLogger('airflow.task') → get_task_logger(ti)\r\n\r\nIt's definitely good to use and extend existing Python logging module if we can solve the above mention problems.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/314826110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/314834922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2435#issuecomment-314834922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2435","id":314834922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDgzNDkyMg==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T17:09:09Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T17:09:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/314834922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/314841624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2438#issuecomment-314841624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2438","id":314841624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDg0MTYyNA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T17:34:50Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T17:34:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice catch!

To my understanding the Handler will be opened at first call (ie. logger.getLogger) thus it is automatically per task run. RotatingFileHandler faces the same issue and has solved it.\r\n2. That is just a configuration and you could log to both at the same time if you want. But maybe this is for the discussion in a minute as I don't quite understand why you think this could be an issue. If you don't want to STDOUT and a file at the same time, just use a Filter which is part of the same logging configuration.\r\n3. This is what you pass to the record i.e. `log.warning(\"Hello\", dag_id=\"my_dag\")` results in a record attribute that you can access by `getattr(record, 'dag_id', None)`. So while you need to override the handle method it does not require a lot of extra changes. See for inspirational purposes the `ServerFormatter` here: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/log.py\r\n\r\nSo no I don't think your approach is more flexible, but the contrary:\r\n\r\n1. Only one handler needed, no additional call, standard config, just replace logging.getLogger(__name__) in TaskInstance with logging.getLogger('airflow.task'). It auto configures everything for everyone.\r\n2. post_logging: not required, gets automatically called\r\n3. Yes needs to be implemented\r\n4.

As I mentioned, this solution has difficulties in actual implementation. So I spent some time writing the logic out. I have my working code pasted below and some pros and cons for this approach.\r\n### Pros:\r\n1. Re-use python logging module config parser (dictConfig)\r\n2. Easy to extend existing Python log handlers by creating subclass \r\n\r\n### Cons:\r\n1. [Critical] Need to change all operator code to use airflow.task logger instead of root logger\r\n    1.

The log processing is trying to fish the application id from the output if it's cluster mode. If buffered, this won't be available until the buffer is full enough or EOF, whichever is earlier.\r\n - The mock/Popen mismatch for strings versus bytes is correctly noted. It's been fixed by making everything strings, which is probably the right thing given the regex code. (Otherwise an equally valid fix would have been to make the mocks return bytes to match Popen.)\r\n - I'm a newbie with Airflow, but was under the impression that most of the codebase assumes textual data is encoded with UTF-8.
