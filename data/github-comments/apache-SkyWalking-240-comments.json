After that, I realized an auto-config log4j would give more help than dynamic statistics. We should promise to change the logging level on the fly since rebooting OAP would cover up the problems.\r\n\r\nThe reason is :\r\n\r\n1. Logging has more details than metrics, which will give our users more flexible paths to investigate issues. \r\n2. Logging would use fewer resources than specific metrics with some turn-on/off switches. \r\n\r\nFor this issue, if the ALS-related debugs logging is active, the user will leverage `grep` and `wc` to filter and statistic objects they want. We might provide some instruments about how to statistic the key metrics, or enhancement `swctl` to handle logs. \r\n\r\nFuture more, log4j has provided some ways to implement [auto-config](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/customconfig.html). We will introduce a mutation API to change the logging level for a particular logger.
