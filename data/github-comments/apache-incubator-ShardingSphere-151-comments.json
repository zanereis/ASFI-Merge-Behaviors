everyone,\r\n\r\nI intend to shift some of my focus on this issue. As you know, [Information_schema](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6212#issuecomment-665589111) is the most effort-taking and the last way for us to achieve this optimization.\r\nAfter my crude investigation, I feel that it is feasible to only load the column metadata for configured tables and table names for unconfigured tables. \r\nHowever, some of the decoupling work is needed to be done before that. I will finish this one ASAP. Moreover, @xbkaishui would you like to restart our previous plan and try your best to make #6247 merged? I believe you are the right one for that, also I'd like to listen to your thinking. :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTrista","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/686454063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/686464542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7237#issuecomment-686464542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7237","id":686464542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjQ2NDU0Mg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T12:46:23Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T12:46:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 14394](https://coveralls.io/builds/33206229)\n\n* **5** of **5**   **(100.0%)**  changed or added relevant lines in **2** files are covered.\n* No unchanged relevant lines lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage remained the same at **34.12%**\n\n---\n\n\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/33206229/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/33206229) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 14393](https://coveralls.io/builds/33205049): |  0.0% |\n| Covered Lines: | 35426 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 103827 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -
