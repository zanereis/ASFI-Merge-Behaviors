Can you add a redundant hive-sync call in ITTestHoodieDemo (https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-integ-test/src/test/java/org/apache/hudi/integ/ITTestHoodieDemo.java#L121) which uses hudi-hive-sync tool directly instead of delta-streamer for one table (pick COW) . This would atleast catch issues like this in future\r\n\r\n@bvaradar replaced hive-sync to be performed through **hive-sync-tool** for COW table, instead of a redundant call. Its better for the hive-sync to hit its most used code path. Hive sync though delta streamer is still being tested for MOR table and also for the later ingestions in the same test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627235951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627236579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1618#issuecomment-627236579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1618","id":627236579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzIzNjU3OQ==","user":{"login":"umehrot2","id":8647012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8647012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2","html_url":"https://github.com/umehrot2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umehrot2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-12T09:51:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T09:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Good job @umehrot2, acked by following commands\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Drat.skip=true\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ./docker/setup_demo.sh\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> cat docker/demo/data/batch_1.json | kafkacat -b kafkabroker -t stock_ticks -P\r\n> docker exec -it adhoc-2 /bin/bash\r\n> \r\n> spark-submit \\\r\n>   --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.HoodieDeltaStreamer $HUDI_UTILITIES_BUNDLE \\\r\n>   --table-type COPY_ON_WRITE \\\r\n>   --source-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.JsonKafkaSource \\\r\n>   --source-ordering-field ts  \\\r\n>   --target-base-path /user/hive/warehouse/stock_ticks_cow \\\r\n>   --target-table stock_ticks_cow --props /var/demo/config/kafka-source.properties \\\r\n>   --schemaprovider-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.FilebasedSchemaProvider\r\n> \r\n> spark-submit \\\r\n>   --class org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.HoodieDeltaStreamer $HUDI_UTILITIES_BUNDLE \\\r\n>   --table-type MERGE_ON_READ \\\r\n>   --source-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.JsonKafkaSource \\\r\n>   --source-ordering-field ts \\\r\n>   --target-base-path /user/hive/warehouse/stock_ticks_mor \\\r\n>   --target-table stock_ticks_mor \\\r\n>   --props /var/demo/config/kafka-source.properties \\\r\n>   --schemaprovider-class org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.FilebasedSchemaProvider \\\r\n>   --disable-compaction\r\n> \r\n> /var/hoodie/ws/hudi-hive-sync/run_sync_tool.sh \\\r\n>   --jdbc-url jdbc:hive2://hiveserver:10000 \\\r\n>   --user hive \\\r\n>   --pass hive \\\r\n>   --partitioned-by dt \\\r\n>   --base-path /user/hive/warehouse/stock_ticks_cow \\\r\n>   --database default \\\r\n>   --table stock_ticks_cow\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n@lamber-ken thanks for your testing.

Or something related to the handling of rollback?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627425251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627430911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1621#issuecomment-627430911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1621","id":627430911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzQzMDkxMQ==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-12T15:51:23Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T15:51:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627430911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627435086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1598#issuecomment-627435086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1598","id":627435086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzQzNTA4Ng==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-12T15:58:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T15:58:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This seems like a performance issue, thanks for reporting this, will delve into this. : )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627435086/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/627445655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1598#issuecomment-627445655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1598","id":627445655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzQ0NTY1NQ==","user":{"login":"reste85","id":14905251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTA1MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14905251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85","html_url":"https://github.com/reste85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reste85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-12T16:17:21Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T16:17:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> This seems like a performance issue, thanks for reporting this, will delve into this. : )\r\n\r\nThank you @lamber-ken.

@vinothchandar \r\nThanks for the feedback. After looking into the code, I think to find the exact metadata size of each file would be difficult and inefficient because we might need to decode the file. We don't know the size of each record when generating the `WriteStats`. Right now we use `FileStatus.getLen()` to get the size. \r\nI agreed that using the bloom filter setting in the WriteConfig could work. We can add Bloom Filter setting into the commit metadata if we want to make it more accurate. \r\nI like the idea to have separate consolidated metadata.

Travis has a queue size. Usually 10 per repo. Since we are in apache repo and apache has bought 50 capacity in ~2014, we are sharing the queue with lot of other projects. I am not sure if they upgraded the queue size beyond 50.\r\n2. Since the queue is shared, adding more jobs to the queue will be worse in the bigger picture since we are going to take 45 mins across 2 jobs instead of 30 mins for one. This might create bigger backlogs in the CI queue.\r\n3. Also each job is independent of each other and it will be very hard to collate the unit tests across each other to arrive at a global coverage number for the project. We will have to push the reports to some external storage, run another job just to aggregate and then publish that result.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/628152561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/628179140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1598#issuecomment-628179140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1598","id":628179140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODE3OTE0MA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-13T18:51:26Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T18:51:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@reste85 that step where it hangs is simply trying to do a `countByKey` on the input (no part of Hudi indexing , writing is even triggered yet...)...

So previously when we have only 2 jobs (unit tests and integration tests), it is due to unit tests taking longer and covering all modules so that report was accurate. If integration test job takes longer and finishes later, coverage report will also be affected. We need to avoid this kind of dependency.\r\n\r\nWhen we modularize projects, by design we should be able to and encouraged to run unit tests for each module independently. The integration test then serves the purpose of checking cross-module functionalities. As for the overall coverage report, I think it should be a pure appending of all kinds of test reports without chronological overwriting. Thus, I think the setup perhaps can be improved in such way that all jobs are free to submit the reports whenever they finish and codecov  sums up all submissions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/628260195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/628282107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1557#issuecomment-628282107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1557","id":628282107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODI4MjEwNw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-13T22:38:02Z","updated_at":"2020-05-13T22:38:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing with a WIP tag for future follow up.

Thanks for the response. You mean the feature of delete? So what I'm working on is having data writing to storage through hudi with hudi version 0.5.0 but I was using fresh build from the git sha mentioned above https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/commit/506447fd4fde4cd922f7aa8f4e17a7f06666dc97),Latest. So the workaround that I used was to use a build from https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/commit/506447fd4fde4cd922f7aa8f4e17a7f06666dc97),Latest to do a upsert (so that I can have schema under extraMetadata session under the most recent commit file) and then do the delete and this is the only way to make the 0.5.0 data deletable.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/628778573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
