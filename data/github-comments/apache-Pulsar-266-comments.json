What is the value returns before?\r\n\r\n@sijie \r\nFor Java 8u272, Arrays.asList(sslEngine.getSupportedProtocols()).toString() returns `[TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, TLSv1, SSLv3, SSLv2Hello]`.\r\nFor Java 8u232, it's `[SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]`.\r\n\r\n[The `protocols` field in `KeyStoreSSLContext` was unused before](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/5bbd44784a9e4bc58ee5025025d748b52b21825a/pulsar-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/util/keystoretls/KeyStoreSSLContext.java#L79) and it's an old bug that the field was never used to configure the enabled TLS protocols for the SSLEngine.\r\n\r\nTLS `protocols` are properly passed in `NettyServerSslContextBuilder` class, so this has been a bug in the code that uses `KeyStoreSSLContext`.\r\n\r\nbtw. The KeyStoreSSLContext class is also used for the web server. In those cases, [the protocols aren't configured and there's also a comment about it in the code](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/5bbd44784a9e4bc58ee5025025d748b52b21825a/pulsar-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/util/keystoretls/KeyStoreSSLContext.java#L247). \r\nHowever there's a default value in `KeyStoreSSLContext` which will get used if null is passed to protocols. \r\nIt's defined at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/5bbd44784a9e4bc58ee5025025d748b52b21825a/pulsar-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/common/util/keystoretls/KeyStoreSSLContext.java#L52 .\r\nPreviously this default value has been ignored since it was never set to the SSLEngine. With this PR, it will get set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728679620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728681953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8581#issuecomment-728681953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8581","id":728681953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODY4MTk1Mw==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-17T04:42:05Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T04:42:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Is there any way to add a test case?\r\n> This is security related code\r\n> We should prevent regressions\r\n\r\nYes. It would be possible to create a negative test case where the client and server are configured to use different TLS protocols. In that case, the TLS handshake shouldn't succeed and the connection shouldn't get established. That would catch the bug that was in the code. In addition, there could be a few tests that check that connections can be established when the server contains at least one of the protocols that is enabled on the client.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728681953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728690554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8565#issuecomment-728690554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8565","id":728690554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODY5MDU1NA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-17T05:12:59Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T05:12:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdhabalia Seems dup with #8555 ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728690554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/728690794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7854#issuecomment-728690794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7854","id":728690794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODY5MDc5NA==","user":{"login":"odidev","id":40816837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODE2ODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40816837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev","html_url":"https://github.com/odidev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odidev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-17T05:13:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T05:13:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for merging.\r\n\r\nIt will be useful if arm64 jobs are added to Travis-CI.

This will need careful review by the experts but hopefully it’s done correctly but we’ve not tested failure cases (lossy network etc).\r\n\r\nThe ConsumerFilter can be dynamically loaded if that was what you are suggesting the NarClassLoader for but possibly it’s more like the AuthenticationProviders which are just class loaded from the class path? There’s only a single filter per broker so it’s more like an implementation that you can swap out rather than a user defined extension.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAndre\r\n\r\nFrom: Sijie Guo <notifications@github.com>\r\nSent: 16 November 2020 17:57\r\nTo: apache/pulsar <pulsar@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Kramer, Andre <Andre.Kramer@softwareag.com>; Mention <mention@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [apache/pulsar] Consumer filtering (#8544)\r\n\r\n\r\n@sijie requested changes on this pull request.\r\n\r\nA couple of major comments:\r\n\r\n  1.  what is the performance & GC implication here? I think the community would like to see benchmark results and performance numbers around that.
