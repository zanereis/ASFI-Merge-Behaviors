All `other contrib/auth/backends` modules should be removed as they don't integrate with FAB UI well, and LDAP/OAuth on FAB UI should be done by extending `SecurityManager` instead (@feng-tao please advise if you agree on this).\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/458840589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/458918721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4468#issuecomment-458918721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4468","id":458918721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODkxODcyMQ==","user":{"login":"yiheng","id":1297418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc0MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng","html_url":"https://github.com/yiheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-30T11:58:52Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T11:58:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like this will break airflow in python 3.6.

, I would suggest we do it in multiple small PRs instead of one single giant PR which is to help us to revert in case anything happens.\r\n\r\nIn terms of this pr, I think FAB supports LDAP / OATH authentication(https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html#supported-authentication-types) which has been used by lyft's superset service in production. Hence I think we could remove those. For password_auth, I think it is worth to check in the email alias and see if anyone still depends on it. If it turns out that many people are still using it, we should refactor for FAB's  ab_user table.

Or it has to run airflow users -c first?\r\n\r\nYou don't have to run `users -c` first - the import command will create any users that don't already exist with the `roles` configured in the .json file. I'm not sure how we would use a default, since the `role` field has to be supplied in the .json configuration.\r\n\r\n> Is there any different behavior when we use different authentication type(e.g LDAP vs OATH)?\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the command should be the same, but the way it's used would be different. I think the ideal process for OAuth is:\r\n\r\n1.  User registers via the UI, which creates the user in the DB with their username set to the ID used by the identity provider (for Google OAuth, this is a long ID string)\r\n2. An admin updates `<file>.json` to add the user to the appropriate roles\r\n3. Admin (or some automated process) runs `airflow -i <file>.json` to ensure all users are assigned to the correct roles\r\n\r\n> Is there a way to limit the cli to run by Admin only? I think from security point of view, we should think about this if it doesn't support(could be a different pr).\r\n\r\nTo run this command successfully, the user would need access to the CLI and read-write permissions on the metastore.

One question I may not be clear is actually related to new user registration.

They are only applicable for the Flask-Admin based UI), and related code (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3793)\r\n2. decommission modules in `airflow/contrib/auth/backends/`, other than `password_auth` (`LICENSE` and `NOTICE` will be updated accordingly) (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3794).\r\n3. decommission or refactor `airflow/contrib/auth/backends/password_auth` (**to be decided**).\r\n\r\nI will prepare PRs separately to address item 1 and 2 first.
