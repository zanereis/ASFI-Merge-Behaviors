Thanks very much for your comment! I think a big difference is: earlier code call BlockManager#dropFromMemory within putLock, but now we call it in parallel, we have to check it carefully. \nAbout the try-catch, I agree using `finally` would be better, I will work on it.\nAbout the `entry.getSize`, I found I need `pair.getValue` twice, so I extract it into `val entry = pair.getValue`.

has 2 jobs. 1) iterate entries and select blocks to be dropped. 2) if to-be-dropped blocks can free enough space, mark them as dropping and return them to the caller.\n`ensureFreeSpace` is called within putLock, so each thread will see the dropping flag modification(I will discuss flag resetting in exception handling later) and thus get different to-be-dropped blocks. And block reading don't need the dropping flag so no conflict there. Let's consider block removing and exception handling(reset dropping flag)\nJob 1 of `ensureFreeSpace`(selecting) and removing are both synchronized by `entries`, so they must process by turn. \nIf a block is removed first, then everything is OK. \nIf a block is removed after Job 2 of `ensureFreeSpace`(marking) which is also synchronized by `entries`(in my modification), then the block will be dropped into disk and managed by diskStore, which I think is OK.\nIf a block is removed between selecting and marking, the marking will check if entry is null, so it's OK, too.\nAbout exception handling, flag resetting is also synchronized by `entries`, so it won't process during selecting and marking.\nIf resetting happened before selecting, then selecting will be able to select these blocks and re-drop them.\nIf resetting happened after selecting, which means the selected to-be-dropped blocks won't include the resetted blocks, so there is no conflict.\nActually there are 3 place that write or read the dropping flag(selecting, marking and resetting) and they are all synchronized by `entries`, so I think we don't need to define the flag as volatile.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43733545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43734386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/772#issuecomment-43734386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/772","id":43734386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzM0Mzg2","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-21T09:41:14Z","updated_at":"2014-05-21T09:41:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Build

With the latest commit, the issue with dropping flag is gone - which is great.\n- There is a change of behavior w.r.t earlier code.\n  Whether the earlier code was the way it was intentionally or accidentally, I am not sure - will let @mateiz or others comment.\n\nEssentially there are a few things here :\n\na) What happens if existing block is re-added. Looks like this was probably handled earlier also ?\nI went up the call tree a bit, and did not look like this was prevented : but maybe I missed it. Any comments @mateiz ?\n\nb) What happens if same block is added in parallel by two threads.\nIf this was supported usecase, then the current PR breaks this - it is possible for first thread to add it, and second to evict it from memory in case it was not possible to host both two copies in memory (according to the free space computed).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43736593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43737610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/837#issuecomment-43737610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/837","id":43737610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzM3NjEw","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-21T10:19:08Z","updated_at":"2014-05-21T10:19:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged

Hence 2 x 100 bytes are inserted after dropping only 100 bytes. \n\nIs this sequence possible?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43744004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43744225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/791#issuecomment-43744225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/791","id":43744225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQ0MjI1","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-21T11:47:04Z","updated_at":"2014-05-21T11:47:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cloud-fan there are multiple calls to memoryStore to directly put a block - not just from external addition.\nSo looking at only doPut might not help ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43744225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43744304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/791#issuecomment-43744304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/791","id":43744304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQ0MzA0","user":{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-21T11:48:08Z","updated_at":"2014-05-21T11:48:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tdas there is a dropping flag which prevents this.\nOr did I misunderstand your query ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43744304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/43744445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/791#issuecomment-43744445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/791","id":43744445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzQ0NDQ1","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-21T11:50:05Z","updated_at":"2014-05-21T11:50:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mridulm i may be missing something as well.
