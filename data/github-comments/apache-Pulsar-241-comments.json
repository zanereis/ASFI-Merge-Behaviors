make `clear()` thread-safe may be better, **I'm not sure if the crash is caused by this**.\r\n\r\nFirst, make a correction that `clear()` is called only when the connection is established:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid ConsumerImpl::connectionOpened(const ClientConnectionPtr& cnx) {\r\n    /* ... */\r\n\r\n    unAckedMessageTrackerPtr_->clear();\r\n    batchAcknowledgementTracker_.clear();\r\n\r\n    /* ... */\r\n    uint64_t requestId = client->newRequestId();\r\n    SharedBuffer cmd = Commands::newSubscribe(\r\n        topic_, subscription_, consumerId_, requestId, getSubType(), consumerName_, subscriptionMode_,\r\n        startMessageId_, readCompacted_, config_.getProperties(), config_.getSchema(), getInitialPosition());\r\n    // trigger the `handleCreateConsumer()` method after receiving response from broker\r\n    cnx->sendRequestWithId(cmd, requestId)\r\n        .addListener(\r\n            std::bind(&ConsumerImpl::handleCreateConsumer, shared_from_this(), cnx, std::placeholders::_1));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe future is completed in `handleCreateConsumer`, which is after `connectionOpened`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid ConsumerImpl::handleCreateConsumer(const ClientConnectionPtr& cnx, Result result) {\r\n    static bool firstTime = true;\r\n    if (result == ResultOk) {\r\n        /* ... */\r\n        consumerCreatedPromise_.setValue(shared_from_this());  // getConsumerCreatedFuture() is completed\r\n    } else {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `ClientImpl::handleConsumerCreated` will be called, see:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid ClientImpl::handleSubscribe(const Result result, const LookupDataResultPtr partitionMetadata,\r\n                                 TopicNamePtr topicName, const std::string& consumerName,\r\n                                 ConsumerConfiguration conf, SubscribeCallback callback) {\r\n    if (result == ResultOk) {\r\n        /* ... */\r\n        // `handleConsumerCreated` is called when getConsumerCreatedFuture() is completed\r\n        consumer->getConsumerCreatedFuture().addListener(\r\n            std::bind(&ClientImpl::handleConsumerCreated, shared_from_this(), std::placeholders::_1,\r\n                      std::placeholders::_2, callback, consumer));\r\n        Lock lock(mutex_);\r\n        consumers_.push_back(consumer);\r\n        lock.unlock();\r\n        consumer->start();\r\n    } else {\r\n```\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid ClientImpl::handleConsumerCreated(Result result, ConsumerImplBaseWeakPtr consumerImplBaseWeakPtr,\r\n                                       SubscribeCallback callback, ConsumerImplBasePtr consumer) {\r\n    callback(result, Consumer(consumer));  // Finally, the consumer argument of `Client::subscribe` is set to this consumer\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, the consumer could only call `acknowledge` or `receive` after `subscribe` returned, the race condition couldn't happen even if `clear()` of trackers is not thread-safe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/677716498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/677717058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7858#issuecomment-677717058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7858","id":677717058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzcxNzA1OA==","user":{"login":"MarvinCai","id":13480084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDgwMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13480084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai","html_url":"https://github.com/MarvinCai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarvinCai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T14:57:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T14:57:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

@zymap, The logs weren't helpful for me to look at as there was no errors but I can give an example of the properties I set to get to the issue.\r\n\r\nIn broker.conf I would clear out the brokerServicePort and AdvertisedAddress fields.\r\n\r\nThen I would set the advertisedListeners and internalListenerName to something like below (with valid ip addressess in the real case).\r\n\r\nadvertisedListeners=internal:pulsar://0.0.0.0:6650,external:pulsar://1.1.1.1:6660\r\ninternalListenerName=internal\r\n\r\nSo when I would start pulsar up normally with just using the advertisedAddress and the brokerServicePort I would see a line like below in the logs where the broker url was the combination of the two which is what I expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:46:33.806 [main] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.broker.PulsarService - messaging service is ready, bootstrap service port = 8080, broker url= pulsar://0.0.0.0:6650\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I used the advertisedListeners and internalListenerName fields, instead of the broker url being the ip:port combination that is expected from the advertisedListeners list it was getting resolved to the instances hostname instead.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/677751653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/677973201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7852#issuecomment-677973201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7852","id":677973201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Nzk3MzIwMQ==","user":{"login":"Huanli-Meng","id":48120384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTIwMzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48120384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng","html_url":"https://github.com/Huanli-Meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huanli-Meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T00:32:40Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T00:32:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot

I think use `message id` is a alternative way. \r\nBut I don't think clock time is an issue, since both the `publish time` and `seek time` are specified from the client side. \r\nUsing `publish time` and `seek time` to decides whether  have available messages  make sence for me.\r\n\r\nThink about this case, \r\nif we seek at a timestamp after `publish time` of the last message, there **should be no messages available**. \r\nBut if we use MessageId to decides whether  have available messages , \r\n1. the `seek(Timestamp)` will return with the `last messageId`\r\n2. the `getLastMessageId` also return the `last messageId`\r\n3. if `resetIncludeHead` is true\r\n\r\n`hasMessageAvailable` will return true, and this is not right.
