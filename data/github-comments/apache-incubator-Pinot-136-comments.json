As i've pasted in my message above, all you need to do is remove the non-array fields from the fieldsToUnnest. Regarding the transform functions you're trying out, it will not work for the existing rows, because those rows don't have any way of knowing what \"header\" is. That information was only in the source data. To make it work in a backward compatible manner, you'll have to provide a \"defaultValue\" to the JSONPATHSTRING function as, JSONPATHSTRING(header, '$.trId', ''). It would be best to 1) try with the complex config or 2) reingest the data\r\n\r\nYEs it will not work for existing rows , but it is not working for new rows even. I dont want backward compatible just wanted to get data for new records in this new column.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1125633524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1125650516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8658#issuecomment-1125650516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8658","id":1125650516,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DGBBU","user":{"login":"suddendust","id":84911643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTExNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84911643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust","html_url":"https://github.com/suddendust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T04:39:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T04:39:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang @npawar Just a reminder, thanks :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1125650516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1125709629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8691#issuecomment-1125709629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8691","id":1125709629,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DGPc9","user":{"login":"KKcorps","id":5559703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTk3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5559703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps","html_url":"https://github.com/KKcorps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T06:43:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T06:43:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's already ` waitForMessagesToPublish` in the code.

It's very detailed and well explained. \n\nWhat I am not sure if there is a need for this in Pinot in a real life use case.\n\nTraditionally, these strategies work well for task distribution where a task can be executed on any of the worker nodes and there is a huge variance among the task.. something like one task taking 10 minutes vs 1 minute vs hour etc.note that I explicitly left out millisecond and second because when a task takes such a small amount of time, the feedback loop needs to be really fast.\n\n\nIn case of Pinot, we don't really have a lot of choice since each segment is already assigned to a set of nodes mostly 3 for fault tolerance. There is not much, we can do given that we just have 3 options for a given segment.\n\nIt will be great to see a real life example where we could have either seen better latency or throughput based because of this change..\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1126628052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1126663376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8702#issuecomment-1126663376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8702","id":1126663376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DJ4TQ","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-14T07:33:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-14T07:48:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8702?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8702](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8702?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (cc5c5b8) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/d06338acb8b9cf05fe085b7ae1261ea289c5d91e?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (d06338a) will **increase** coverage by `40.67%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8702       +/-   ##\n=============================================\n+ Coverage     29.04%   69.72%   +40.67%     \n- Complexity       45     4572     +4527     \n=============================================\n  Files          1710     1722       +12     \n  Lines         89508    89862      +354     \n  Branches      13289    13327       +38     \n=============================================\n+ Hits          26001    62654    +36653     \n+ Misses        61096    22883    -38213     \n- Partials       2411     4325     +1914     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.97% <ø> (+0.07%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `25.26% <ø> (+0.02%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `66.15% <ø> (?)` | |\n| unittests2 | `14.30% <ø> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Helped recover latency spikes that were coming from the slow server. This has happened so many times during oncall etc and almost always we circle back to the fact that \"if there was single node/server resiliency, some of the thing could have been avoided or may be there were fewer alerts, latency spikes could have been less worse\"\r\n\r\nWe have also seen the following (this is the 2nd sub-problem outlined in the issue)\r\n\r\n- A slow query on the server takes up CPU and compromises the other queued up and/or running queries that could have finished faster. \r\n- Eventually all queries (whether expensive or inexpensive) take up a lot of time.\r\n- There is no work stealing or scheduling -- there is no way to forestall a query based on priority / weight and \"make slow queries run slower by scheduling them late / giving them few cores etc\" and reduce the cascading impact of expensive queries on other queries.\r\n\r\n@vvivekiyer -  please add other notes on the background of problem from the other concrete production examples. \r\n\r\nThe current design doc addresses the first problem as of now and we have a code / impl in progress that we are planning to test this week and also share the PR / discuss feedback etc on the approach.\r\n\r\nPS - @vvivekiyer  and I had sync'd up with @Jackie-Jiang  sometime back to tell we are working on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1127815429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1127928213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8710#issuecomment-1127928213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8710","id":1127928213,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DOtGV","user":{"login":"jtao15","id":50065407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDY1NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50065407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15","html_url":"https://github.com/jtao15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtao15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-16T17:15:10Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T17:15:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

Remove index restart servers -> check index are removed\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1128227700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1128275001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8706#issuecomment-1128275001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8706","id":1128275001,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DQBw5","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T00:35:12Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T00:35:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks for trying this out!

When getting it from the `FROM` clause, we want to match it with the tables available in pinot. If we support dot in the table name, it will make it slightly hard to parse the name.

To avoid name conflict, we can reject namespace with underlying `_` or perform a prefix check when adding a new namespace.\r\n\r\nSome reference about not using `.`:\r\n- https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/1166/is-it-okay-to-put-dots-in-sql-server-database-names#:~:text=Complex%20SQL%20actions%20are%20processed,if%20the%20base%20is%20fine.&text=These%20errors%20may%20more%20often,of%20anything%20on%20sql%20server.\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41948399/is-it-good-practice-to-use-dots-within-table-names-in-mysql","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1129335759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1129348268","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8721#issuecomment-1129348268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8721","id":1129348268,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DUHys","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T21:48:21Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T21:48:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8721?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8721](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8721?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (5c84901) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/3bbae6ef6145ca29af7f8d0f115263437eef63bd?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (3bbae6e) will **increase** coverage by `3.41%`.\n> The diff coverage is `76.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8721      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     66.20%   69.62%   +3.41%     \n- Complexity     4389     4576     +187     \n============================================\n  Files          1279     1729     +450     \n  Lines         64619    90183   +25564     \n  Branches      10089    13415    +3326     \n============================================\n+ Hits          42781    62786   +20005     \n- Misses        18802    23044    +4242     \n- Partials       3036     4353    +1317     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `26.96% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n| integration2 | `25.34% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1 | `66.13% <76.00%> (-0.07%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `14.27% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

I already saw JDBC H2 error if I copy/paste the Full integration test because JDBC engine treat dots as separator by default. That is why I hide the support with a feature flag. cc @apucher . The H2 error can be bypassed by using backticks.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as I mentioned, table name with dots can provide a transition/middle ground before we fully support full multi-tenant/DB concept.\r\nBy this PR, we can allow the user write something naturally:\r\n`SELECT col1 from mydb.test_table where xxx` while the `mydb.test_table` is managed by Pinot admins, and the user is assigned `mydb` from the DataWarehouse infrastructure on top of Pinot.\r\n\r\nIf this is not breaking other features, providing extra flexibility (extra knob) will help support more use cases, it actually expands Pinot's
