If I understand correctly, the approach is using the AUTO_CONSUME schema and the PIP-43 to achieve this purpose. Previously, we always use the AUTO_CONSUME schema for a consumer. Essentially, the AUTO_CONSUME schema is a Generic Schema that works with GenericRecord, encode a GenericRecord to byte[] and decode byte[] to GenericRecord. So we don't need to change the existing implementation, we can use the AUTO_CONSUME schema for a producer too to allow the producer able to publish GenericRecord.\r\n\r\nAnd with PIP-45, the message carries the real schema. So that we are able to publish GenericRecord with different version schemas.\r\n\r\nPlease point out if I am wrong, thanks. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/779885238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/779915809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9594#issuecomment-779915809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9594","id":779915809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTkxNTgwOQ==","user":{"login":"TheNotary","id":799247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/799247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary","html_url":"https://github.com/TheNotary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNotary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-16T15:34:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T15:40:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I noticed this issue too.  You can debug the problem by viewing the files uploaded to [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pulsar-client/#files).  You'll see file names such as `pulsar_client-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_15_x86_64.whl` wherein the cp38 means C Python 3.8.  They don't have a package for C Python 3.9 or 3.5 (your current python version).  As a work around until they perform more builds, you can use `pyenv` to install Python 3.8 on your mac, and then pip should work.  Use similar debugging to see if you can get a distribution to the Pi ok (Python 3.8 should work on \"manylinux\").  \r\n\r\n@aahmed-se, is that how the maintainers have been publishing the Python stuff too?

You can try the master branch as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781016766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781043128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8510#issuecomment-781043128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8510","id":781043128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTA0MzEyOA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-18T04:34:45Z","updated_at":"2021-02-18T04:34:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, @ta1meng and @michaelkux!\r\n\r\n@congbobo184 @codelipenghui I think we should improve the comparison logic at the broker side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781043128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/781050007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9609#issuecomment-781050007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9609","id":781050007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTA1MDAwNw==","user":{"login":"aahmed-se","id":8009085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se","html_url":"https://github.com/aahmed-se","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-18T04:53:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-18T04:53:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Don't see the point of the modifying the current image.

If you look at the [python pfunc SDK example](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/functions-overview/#content-based-routing-example), it is just `context.publish(topic, item)`  If that is the experience you are after, then, it seems best to keep it simple and consistent.

@Anonymitaet,\r\n\r\nThat looks good.  Your suggestions for the updates are correct.  \r\n\r\nI'm also wondering if you should mention or link to this document as well:  https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/functions-runtime/\r\n\r\nIt contains other useful information for making sure you setup your pulsar resources correctly to work within Kubernetes without issue.  You could point out the customizable options in CustomRuntimeOptions for 'JobName' and 'JobNamespace'.  Having those available can also help a user not run into k8s issues with pod names being too long by default (pf-<tenant>-<namepace>-<function_name>) if you have defined long tenant, namespace, and function names in Pulsar when creating functions on the Kubernetes runtime.
