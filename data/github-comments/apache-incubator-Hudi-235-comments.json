Is there any compatibility changes on the Hudi side across hive2 and hive3?\r\n\r\n@yihua @cdmikechen  I think in our azure ci runs, it seems to show that there are any major changes needed to support hive3 otherwise I think we would have seen more test failures. (Maybe integration testing might catch this)\r\n\r\nWe will also want to check that this pr still allows users to run hadoop 2.x hive 2.x and spark 2 or 3.x as well, without any issues.

@nsivabalan Thank you for quick reply , I tried to add a property \"metricsname.prefix\" to make it more flexible for prometheus statistics , but I found that if I did that , the metric lack an tag to distinguish where the metric from , is there any way to archive it ? In release 0.10.0 ,I found the \"PushGatewayReporter\" class use \"DropwizardExports\" collector , the DropwizardExports does not use any additional tags , so is it possible to add another implementation of reporter just like \"simplecollector\" to archive this ? Look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome to give a try and make some proof-of-concepts.
