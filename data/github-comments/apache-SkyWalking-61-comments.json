This plugin can record the current time, batchSize, and destination.\r\n\r\n>In the codes, the only thing it did, is creating an exit span, but no header related works. So this plugin would't deal with propagation. As the result, the only thing people will get the target nodes in topology.\r\nThen, my questions is, who will take the responsibilities to build parent span? Or is there anyone?\r\n\r\nIn my view,I also thought about this problem at the time. In our project that we have a lot of canal-server nodes. I need to see their dependencies in the topology diagram. I also thought about using the LocalSpan form to write this plugin, but Should this not show topology dependencies? The previous one said that canal-client is just an operation to pull data. So I don't think it needs to handle propagation, but do you think LocalSpan is more suitable? If you think it is, then I will change codes.\r\n\r\n>Also, you need to add lib and versions into the supported list after we could be sure about the purpose of this plugin. \r\n\r\ni will chage it.\r\n\r\n>For my understanding of canal, I assume, we at least need source and destination of canal data sync. Am I right? Where is the entry span? And the trace will continue between source and destination?\r\n\r\nNo, canal-client is only for the convenience of operation and maintenance canal-server, canal-client needs to synchronize data from canal-server, canal-server supports multi-database synchronization, each database  is a destination for canal-client.canal-server has a multi-instance concept,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/447186071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/447187767","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2044#issuecomment-447187767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2044","id":447187767,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzE4Nzc2Nw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T02:05:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T02:05:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe, maybe not.

I think you misunderstand. \r\n\r\nLet's say right now, the whole trace is buffer and waiting, then do the reformat to SkyWalking native trace format, right? Because we want to reuse the process of trace parse codes.\r\n\r\nBut, actually, we don't really need that based on the new core. We have scope dispatcher now. The only thing needs to wait is RPC related spans, we need the client and server span match to build the relation scopes, right? This part is still waiting, no change and no chance to improve.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, other local spans could be passed and saved. Only some RPC related trace id and span id need to buffer in local and do timeout/match (Span info saved in cache for sure, no matter what it is). Also, no need to wait for the whole trace ready, just a pair of RPC spans is ready, the analysis is good to go for this part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/447207811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/447210833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2039#issuecomment-447210833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2039","id":447210833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzIxMDgzMw==","user":{"login":"peng-yongsheng","id":16147247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ3MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16147247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng","html_url":"https://github.com/peng-yongsheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peng-yongsheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T04:37:50Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T04:37:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Step\r\n1.

[Change log](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md) includes the issues(question tag) , so you shouldn't change it after this version had been released. Otherwise, no point to provide change log and milestone.\r\n1. When you do Apache reports, you will need these numbers. Such as.\r\n```\r\nHow has the project developed since the last report?\r\n\r\n  The project has a diverse community, many users, contributors are from \r\n  different companies.\r\n  There has been over 100 commits by more than 22 contributors in the three \r\n  months.\r\n  In 5.0.0-RC2 release milestones, there are 130 issues and pull requests \r\n  solved.\r\n  In 5.0.0-GA release milestones, there are 32 issues and pull requests \r\n  solved.\r\n  In 6.0.0-alpha release milestones, there are 202 issues and pull requests \r\n  solved.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is exact why we need this `question` label. Archive those issues in milestone, also keep the issues clear enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/447238121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/447286741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2045#issuecomment-447286741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2045","id":447286741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzI4Njc0MQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T10:41:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T10:41:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@wu-sheng

is my proposal mail thread. Consider this PR is step 1, **Inventory changes (PROPOSAL ONLY)**.\r\n\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\nI am thinking about SQL and Database analysis solution for a whole. Here are some my thoughts and proposal. Feedback are welcome.\r\nAlso, because I am not working on implementing this feature, all these are suggestions.\r\n\r\n# Inventory changes\r\nAll metadata need register in SkyWalking. So Database instances do the same. Right now, we provide a virtual service metadata for each database instance.\r\nSo we need following adjustments.\r\n1. network_address_inventory src_layer should be renamed as `type`. I know we want to keep upgrade compatible, this is just a suggestion. Because SrcLayer is hard to understand for people.\r\n2. service_instance_inventory and service_inventory add field `type` to bring network_address_inventory's type to higher level.\r\n\r\n# SQL Register\r\nSQL statements are tons in real cluster, we can't and needn't to register and do for all of them.\r\nFirst of all, we just register slow SQL statement, such as slower than `10ms`? (Could provide settings for this).\r\nAlso, keep register number has a limit, such as, for each collector instance, would do slow SQL statement register over 10K times in 30mins.\r\nThen, because register is async way, we could have two solution\r\n1. Use file buffer, waiting for register finished. Like mesh and trace data register. Advantage, one time slow SQL could be catch. Disadvantage, not quickly, especially the application codes are bad, don't use prepare statement.\r\n2. Just send the register, and don't wait. Ignore this time access. Disadvantage, clearly, some first times slow SQL access missed. Delay the opportunities to address slow SQL.\r\nWe could discuss about these two.\r\n\r\n# Source\r\nDBAccess source should be easy, include, db service id, latency, timestamp, status.\r\nSQLStatement sources could be in two\r\n1. ServiceSQLStatement, use service id + sql id as entity id, and include latency, timestamp, status.\r\n2.
