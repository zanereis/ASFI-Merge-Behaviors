`ExtClassLoader`（because the class we wanted to enhance is loaded by `ExtClassLoader`）, to load a Interceptor defined in `skywalking.jar`，but `skywalking.jar` is loader by `AppClassLoader`。Therefore,the load will fail with an `classNotFoundException` thrown\r\n\r\n## Scenario two\r\n\r\nIn the second scenario, the application starts failed.\r\n\r\n![image-20210815174633818](https://gitee.com/easy4coding/blogImage/raw/master/image/image-20210815174633818.png)\r\n\r\nThis is because, when a static method is enhanced, `ByteBuddy` generates a static field for the class. The field is of type `StaticMethodsInter`, which will be set approach by reflection and this behavior will trigger loading of `StaticMethodsInter`\r\n\r\nhowever,the enhanced class is loaded by `ExtClassLoader`，and it can not load `StaticMethodsInter`  from `skywalking.jar` .\r\n\r\nIt can be seen from the above，use `BootstrapClassLoader` to load the class need to enhanced may not take effect。because, the same as `ExtClassLoader`,`BootstrapClassLoader` can not load any class from `skywalking.jar` .\r\n\r\nIn my demo,I did like this to resolve this problem.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic boolean isBootstrapInstrumentation() {\r\n   return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe skywalking can support some configuration to config default return value of this method instead of using  \"false\". For example, We can use `Plugin.BootstrapInstrumentation.dirs=apm-sniffer\\apm-sdk-plugin\\httpClient-4.x-plugin`  to make all  methods named `isBootstrapInstrumentation` in `apm-sniffer\\apm-sdk-plugin\\httpClient-4.x-plugin` directory return true。\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/899041830/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/899041923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7463#issuecomment-899041923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7463","id":899041923,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls841lkqD","user":{"login":"hailin0","id":14371345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzcxMzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14371345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0","html_url":"https://github.com/hailin0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-15T12:16:59Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T12:18:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14371345/129478244-db70c709-d2d4-4563-b389-ee00ff46a9fd.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/899041923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/899042629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7463#issuecomment-899042629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7463","id":899042629,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls841lk1F","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-15T12:23:05Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T13:48:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
