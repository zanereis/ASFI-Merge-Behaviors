Sorry for the late response. I have run the performance test. On a broker with ~15500 log segment files. The log segments loading time is about 6 seconds without this patch. On another broker with 17700 log segments files, the log loading time was 35 seconds with this patch. The results varied a little from run to run, but it is 4x - 6x slower when we need to load the timestamp from the log segment. For a large Kafka cluster, this might be an issue. One optimization may be load the log maximum timestamp lazily. I'll update the new patch after testing that.\n\nI did not see any throughput issue with this patch. So the impact is only at startup time. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/234819292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/234914552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1614#issuecomment-234914552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1614","id":234914552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDkxNDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T10:11:35Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T10:11:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I spent some time looking at this in more detail and after changing a number of additional places to use `CloseableIterator`, it occurred to me that there may be a much simpler solution. We currently have the following code in `ByteBufferMessageSet.deepIterator` that is executed during the constructor of the iterator:\n\n``` scala\n        val messageAndOffsets = if (wrapperMessageAndOffset.message.magic > MagicValue_V0) {\n         val innerMessageAndOffsets = new ArrayDeque[MessageAndOffset]()\n         try {\n           while (true)\n             innerMessageAndOffsets.add(readMessageFromStream())\n         } catch {\n           case eofe: EOFException =>\n             compressed.close()\n           case ioe: IOException =>\n             throw new InvalidMessageException(s\"Error while reading message from stream compressed with ${wrapperMessage.compressionCodec}\", ioe)\n         }\n         Some(innerMessageAndOffsets)\n       } else None\n```\n\nSo, we are reading the whole compressed message set during construction if message format > 0. I suggest we do the same for message format = 0, and then we don't need to change any other code.

The previous 4x - 6x slow down may not be very accurate. I noticed a bug in the code that may cause unnecessary rebuild of the indexes if a time index is empty.\n\nAfter fixing the bug, on a broker with ~20000 log segment files, I got the following results:\n1. log loading time: ~13 seconds without time index. 27-28 seconds with time index.:\n2. I tested a patch that skips sanity check and loads the max timestamp lazily so we don't read the last entry at starting time. The time reduced by 1-2 seconds but not much.\n\nSo it looks that the slow down was mainly caused by the system calls that create the memory mapped files. Because we are creating 2x many memory mapped files, it takes about 2x of the time.\n\nI tested the throughput with part of the production data. The brokers handled fine. And the produce request total time and local time looks similar. I will try to push more traffic and see if that makes any difference.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/235178030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/235189150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1665#issuecomment-235189150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1665","id":235189150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTE4OTE1MA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T07:51:58Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T07:51:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guozhangwang, can you please review this simple PR?

here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14aahuei8dXALtwniyWDpNrsNtEuYc1-L5mPwRhDnWuQ/edit#gid=550436079\n\nIn the graph each bucket contains 250 mmap() or resize() call. The time is the summary of the time taken by all the calls in that bucket. For example, the first 250 mmap() calls during log loading goes to the first bucket, the next 250 mmap() calls goes to the second bucket, and so on.\n\nI am not sure what is the right solution here. Maybe there are some OS level tweaks to avoid the deterioration of the mmap() time and resize() time, but I haven't looked into that yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/235774517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/235795010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1336#issuecomment-235795010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1336","id":235795010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTc5NTAxMA==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T04:01:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T04:01:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Thanks for another round of reviews.

In the google sheet there are also two sheets showing that the time taken by mmap() is related to how many files has already been memory mapped. After we have mapped ~20000 files, the time taken for further mmap() calls increased dramatically.\n\nThe reason we see a 15 times larger loading time is the following. Currently I have about 22000 log segments in a broker. So that results in 22000 offset index files. It took 21 seconds to load. When we do mmap for those files, it is roughly at the tipping point where the mmap() becomes taking much longer. \n\nNow we added the time index file so the number of mmap() call is doubled. Even though the first 22000 mmap() calls took the same time as before, which is 21 seconds, the next 22000 mmap() calls took much longer. It does not matter whether the mmap() calls are for offset index file or time index file. Because after adding the time index, presumably the first 22000 mmap() calls are half/half for each type of index files.\n\nI am not sure if this is OS specific and only an issue for our environment or it is a general issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/236038932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/236050277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1673#issuecomment-236050277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1673","id":236050277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjA1MDI3Nw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T23:00:45Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T23:00:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This test passed, although the run had unrelated failures (other Streams tests).
