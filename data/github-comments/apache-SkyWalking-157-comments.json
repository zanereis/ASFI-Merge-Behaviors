Why do you think OAP should be not powerful enough? As it is not, the speed of data analysis wouldn't catch up with producers(agents). Then what is the point of adding new deployment requirement?\r\n> 2. Maybe you will argue says, the payload is sometimes higher than usual as there is hot business time. But, my question is how much higher?\r\n> 3. If less than 40%, how many resources will you use for the new MQ cluster? How about moving them to new OAP and ES nodes?\r\n> 4. If higher than 40%, 70%~2x? Then, I could say, your MQ wastes more resources than it saves. Your MQ would support 2x~3x payload, and with 10%-20% cost in general time. Furthermore, in this case, if the payload/throughput are so high, how long the OAP cluster could catch up. I would say never before it catches up, the next hot time event is coming.\r\n> \r\n> Besides all this analysis, why do you want the traces still 100%, as you are costing so many resources? Better than this, we could consider adding a better dynamic trace sampling mechanism at the backend, when throughputs go over the threshold, active the sampling rate to 100%->10% step by step, which means you could get the OAP and ES 3 times more powerful than usual, just ignore the traces at hot time.\r\n> \r\n> # How about MQ metrics data exporter?\r\n> I would say, it is already available there. Exporter module with gRPC default mechanism is there. It is easy to provide a new implementor of that module.\r\n> \r\n> Here are my thoughts, hope it helps.\r\n\r\n一句话，不支持MQ，意味着整个平台是封闭的！","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/606364876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/606367596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3435#issuecomment-606367596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3435","id":606367596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjM2NzU5Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-31T02:52:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-31T02:52:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junneyang I think you totally misread the FAQ, and get a wrong conclusion. \r\n\r\nSkyWalking doesn't support MQ to report trace in official release, yes.

What @wu-sheng said above is the best case for figuring out how the plugin works. The documentation for Apache SkyWalking is pretty good and for me to explain how the plugin works would mean to literally re-iterate what's already documented in this project, given that it relies heavily on this project to work. The code for getting Vert.x to work with Apache SkyWalking is < 1000 LOC so the plugin support itself is not the complicated part. See: [Plugin Development Guide](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/guides/Java-Plugin-Development-Guide.md)\r\n\r\nAs for the deprecated methods, you should understand that the Vert.x plugin strives to work with the largest range of versions possible so there may be mentions of deprecated (and even removed) functionality within the plugin itself. With that being said, the code you posted is not actually present in the plugin but rather present in the plugin's test code. Changing that test code wouldn't fix your issue but actually might break the ability to test versions prior to 3.6.x. I'll try to remove it but I imagine I'll end up needing to write an additional test instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/609770532/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/609774863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4609#issuecomment-609774863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4609","id":609774863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTc3NDg2Mw==","user":{"login":"Liloupar","id":13990539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTkwNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13990539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar","html_url":"https://github.com/Liloupar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Liloupar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T12:51:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T12:51:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@BFergerson \r\nen,I understand, thank for you help :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/609774863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/609780806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4611#issuecomment-609780806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4611","id":609780806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTc4MDgwNg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-06T13:03:59Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T13:03:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@EvanLjp I didn't verify it, I was saying, logically we can, but I doubt whether we have enough resources.
