issue is to count the `start-index` and `stop-index` to assert `IndexOrderByItem ` and `ExpressionOrderByItem`\r\n\r\n### How to find the targets to be fixed?\r\n1. Open class `OrderByItemAssert` and clear the comment of `SQLSegmentAssert.assertIs(assertContext, actual, expected)` in `assertIndexOrderByItem` and `assertExpressionOrderByItem`.\r\n2. run `SQLParserParameterizedTest`\r\n3. All the SQL cases which have the error assertion results are our targets to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix the above assertion results?\r\n1. Look at the exception log and find the corresponding `SQL Case ID` and `SQL`.\r\n2. Find out the `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` in `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sql/dml`\r\n3. Calculate the correct `start-index` and `stop-index` of `index-item` and `expression-item` segments of this `SQL`.\r\n4. Add the calculated `start-index` and `stop-index` labels of `index-item` and `expression-item` segments to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID`, like\r\n```\r\n            <index-item index=\"2\" order-direction=\"DESC\" start-index=\"10\" stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the correct `literal-start-index` and `literal-stop-index` of `index-item` and `expression-item` segments to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` when it is necessary, like\r\n```\r\n            <index-item index=\"2\" order-direction=\"DESC\"  literal-start-index=\"10\" literal-stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n6. Run `SQLParserParameterizedTest` again to check whether this `SQL Case ID` does not stay in the list of `SQL` with  `bad assertion result`.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n1. What are the definitions of `index-item` and `expression-item` segments?\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a SQL,\r\n> SELECT user_id, SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum FROM t_order GROUP BY user_id ORDER BY SUM(order_id) LIMIT 5\r\n\r\nThe value of `SUM(order_id)` is a `expression-item`, which always locates behind `order by` or `group by` clause.\r\n\r\n>  SELECT user_id, SUM(order_id) AS orders_sum FROM t_order ORDER BY 1\r\n\r\nThe value of `1` is `index-item`, which means item index used for `order by` or `group by`.\r\n\r\n2. What is the difference between `literal-start-index` and `start-index`?\r\n\r\nWhen a SQL does not contain parameter maker, i.e.,`?`, this SQL only has one form; Otherwise, you will see two forms of this SQL, i.e, a SQL form filled with parameter and a SQL form only with parameter marks. For instance,\r\n```\r\nCase1 One SQL without parameter mark,\r\nselect * from table where id = 1;\r\n\r\nCase2 One SQL with parameter mark,\r\nOriginal SQL: select * from table where id = ?;\r\nSQL filled with Parameter: select * from table where id = 1;\r\n```\r\nReplace `the parameter mark` with `the actual parameter` will change the position of the segment. Therefore we need to add `start-index` to represent the start position of a segment for `Original SQL`, and `literal-start-index` is used to represent the start position of a segment for `SQL filled with Parameter`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/601115961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/601120408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/4851#issuecomment-601120408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4851","id":601120408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTEyMDQwOA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T11:07:48Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T11:39:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## Pull Request Test Coverage Report for [Build 10407](https://coveralls.io/builds/29468866)\n\n* **0** of **3**   **(0.0%)**  changed or added relevant lines in **1** file are covered.\n* **3** unchanged lines in **1** file lost coverage.\n* Overall coverage increased (+**0.0009%**) to **59.642%**\n\n---\n\n|  Changes Missing Coverage | Covered Lines | Changed/Added Lines | % |\n| :-----|--------------|--------|---: |\n| [sharding-core/sharding-core-common/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/core/metadata/ShardingMetaDataLoader.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/29468866/source?filename=sharding-core%2Fsharding-core-common%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Fcore%2Fmetadata%2FShardingMetaDataLoader.java#L115) | 0 | 3 | 0.0%\n<!-- | **Total:** | **0** | **3** | **0.0%** | -->\n\n|  Files with Coverage Reduction | New Missed Lines | % |\n| :-----|--------------|--: |\n| [sharding-orchestration/sharding-orchestration-core/sharding-orchestration-core-registrycenter/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/orchestration/core/registrycenter/util/IpUtils.java](https://coveralls.io/builds/29468866/source?filename=sharding-orchestration%2Fsharding-orchestration-core%2Fsharding-orchestration-core-registrycenter%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Forg%2Fapache%2Fshardingsphere%2Forchestration%2Fcore%2Fregistrycenter%2Futil%2FIpUtils.java#L63) | 3 | 76.0% |\n<!-- | **Total:** | **3** |  | -->\n\n|  Totals | [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/29468866/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/29468866) |\n| :-- | --: |\n| Change from base [Build 1121](https://coveralls.io/builds/29467929): |  0.0009% |\n| Covered Lines: | 12464 |\n| Relevant Lines: | 20898 |\n\n---\n##### 💛  -

Open class `ColumnDefinitionAssert` and clear the comment of \r\n```\r\n        assertThat(assertContext.getText(\"Column definition start index assertion error: \"), actual.getStartIndex(), is(expected.getStartIndex()));\r\n        assertThat(assertContext.getText(\"Column definition stop index assertion error: \"), actual.getStopIndex(), is(expected.getStopIndex()));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2. run `SQLParserParameterizedTest`\r\n3. All the SQL cases which have the error assertion results are our targets to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix the above assertion results?\r\n1. Look at the exception log and find the corresponding `SQL Case ID` and `SQL`.\r\n2. Find out the `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` in `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sql/dml`\r\n3. Calculate the correct `start-index` and `stop-index` of ` ColumnDefinitionSegment` segment of this `SQL`.\r\n4. Add the calculated `start-index` and `stop-index` labels of `ColumnDefinitionSegment` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID`, like\r\n```\r\n            <column-definition type=\"int\" primary-key=\"true\" start-index=\"10\" stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the correct `literal-start-index` and `literal-stop-index` of `ColumnDefinitionSegment` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` when it is necessary, like\r\n```\r\n            <column-definition type=\"int\" primary-key=\"true\"  literal-start-index=\"10\" literal-stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n6. Run `SQLParserParameterizedTest` again to check whether this `SQL Case ID` does not stay in the list of `SQL` with  `bad assertion result`.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n1. What is the definition of `ColumnDefinitionSegment` segment?\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a SQL,\r\n> CREATE TABLE t_log(id int PRIMARY KEY, status varchar(10))\r\n\r\nThe segment of `id int PRIMARY KEY` or `status varchar(10)` is a `ColumnDefinitionSegment `, which defines a column.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. What is the difference between `literal-start-index` and `start-index`?\r\n\r\nWhen a SQL does not contain parameter maker, i.e.,`?`, this SQL only has one form; Otherwise, you will see two forms of this SQL, i.e, a SQL form filled with parameter and a SQL form only with parameter marks.
