The code proposed here adds locks in every method of the state machine class. This makes sure that the internal state of the state machine is consistent at all times. In isolation, this class is thread safe, which is a good thing.\n\nHowever, I also expect the IMRU Driver to make decisions based on this state, and those decisions will require locking. It would be natural to lock on the state machine object itself.\n\nIf we enforce such a policy, we end up with redundant locks: All accesses to the state machine are locked on the state machine object on the caller site, and then locked again inside the state machine. In java, we usually avoid such double locks by synchronizing on `this` inside the class. That way, we at least don't have two locks in play.\n\nSo, I have two questions from this analysis:\n1. Is locking on `this` an accepted C# idiom?\n2. Do we need this class to be thread safe at all, given that it will be used in a thread safe manner?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212545815/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212546214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/938#issuecomment-212546214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/938","id":212546214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjU0NjIxNA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T18:27:50Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T18:27:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @jwang98052 may want to close this PR first.\n\n+1 on only discussing one of these related pull requests at a time.

I understand the PR was to resolve the deprecation issue. However, there are a few things we need to address properly after looking at the code:\n- Network service should be properly injected with existing injector if possible. Given there are so many bindVolatileInstance, that tells me those objects should be already in the existing injector. \n- If any new binding is required, such as LoggingEventHandler, it should be set as part of the driver configuration. Or default should be set/applied. \n- In test code, we should create proper configuration for injecting NetworkService instead of using bindVolatileInstance\n- If additional configuration is added for a forkInjector, it should be bound to a new configuration and use that configuration when calling forkInjector(). Binding with bindVolatileInstance is not recommended unless we have to reuse an existing object. \n\nI would suggest to create a new JIRA to fix the issue. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212550285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212551352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/948#issuecomment-212551352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/948","id":212551352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjU1MTM1Mg==","user":{"login":"dkm2110","id":151031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110","html_url":"https://github.com/dkm2110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkm2110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T18:37:52Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T18:37:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer @jwang98052  I agree with what Markus wrote and raised similar sort of concerns on the JIRA myself.

The caller code needs locks in itself. Consider receiving an `IFailedTask`: We'd have to know for sure whether we are expecting it. Which requires a lock across all the event handlers in the IMRU Driver. If we have that lock, it is immaterial whether or not the state machine itself is threadsafe from a correctness perspective. It matters, however, from a performance perspective. Also, declaring the state machine thread safe might mislead us into not having proper locks in the Driver.\n\nIf we absolutely must have a thread safe Driver state machine for other uses, we should at least get rid of the enforced double locking. Which brings me to:\n\n> C# doesn't have synchronized method.\n\nYes, but can we use `this` as the lock, e.g. `lock(this)`? That would get the equivalent of `synchronized` methods, and also only one lock.\n\nRegarding the _name space_ structure:\n\nBoth of these state machines are used in the driver exclusively. Hence  `Org.Apache.REEF.IMRU.OnREEF.IMRUTask.StateMachine` is misleading. The most specific namespace for them would be somewhere in `Org.Apache.REEF.IMRU.OnREEF.Driver`, e.g. `Org.Apache.REEF.IMRU.OnREEF.Driver.StateMachine`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212650693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212651657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/950#issuecomment-212651657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/950","id":212651657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjY1MTY1Nw==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T23:31:46Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T23:31:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212651657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212653556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/959#issuecomment-212653556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/959","id":212653556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjY1MzU1Ng==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T23:42:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T23:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tried to review, but stopped as the code keeps changing.

Or we can use ConcurrentDictionay that itself is thread safe, the caller doesn't need to worry about the lock. \n\nThis is not true. Using only thread safe classes does not make a class thread safe. Consider the following case:\n\n``` C#\nnamespace ThreadSafety\n{\n    internal class Problematic\n    {\n        private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<int, int> _dictionary = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, int>();\n\n        internal void Increment(int key)\n        {\n            _dictionary[key] = Get(key) + 1;\n        }\n\n        internal int Get(int key)\n        {\n            if (_dictionary.ContainsKey(key))\n            {\n                return _dictionary[key];\n            }\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        public void WreckHavoc()\n        {\n            var random = new Random();\n            const int maxIndex = 100;\n\n            while (true)\n            {\n                {\n                    var index = (int)(random.NextDouble() * maxIndex);\n                    var oldValue = Get(index);\n                    Increment(index);\n                    var newValue = Get(index);\n                    if (newValue != oldValue + 1)\n                    {\n                        throw new Exception(\"Synchronization error.\");\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n    internal class Program\n    {\n        private static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            var problematicInstance = new Problematic();\n\n            const int nThreads = 12;\n            var threads = new Thread[nThreads];\n\n            for (var i = 0; i < nThreads; ++i)\n            {\n                threads[i] = new Thread(problematicInstance.WreckHavoc);\n                threads[i].Start();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nClearly, we are only using thread safe attribute types. Yet, the class as a whole isn't thread safe.\n\nWe need the Driver to be thread safe here. For that, it doesn't matter whether the state machine classes are thread safe. The code above would be equally wrong if it used mere `Dictionary` instances.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212668468/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/212670271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/959#issuecomment-212670271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/959","id":212670271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjY3MDI3MQ==","user":{"login":"shulmanb","id":519484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb","html_url":"https://github.com/shulmanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T00:37:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T00:37:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@afchung

Yes. This is by design, same goes in the Java side. This is because if an Task receives a `CloseEvent` when it shouldn't, it should not be ignored. In this case, when the Evaluator is force-shut-down, a `CloseEvent` is sent to the Task to try to warn it such that a user may have a chance to perform some sort of state-preserving operation.

In the Java Evaluator, we want to make sure that the heartbeats sent to the Driver are consistent. However, we have many places that could trigger them from several threads. Hence, we need to coordinate.\n\nThe way we do it is via the `HeartbeatManager`. That is a singleton object that generates the heartbeats. All the relevant parts of the Evaluator have the instance of that type injected. They `synchronize` on that instance, which I believe is the same thing as to `lock` on an object in C#. All methods in that class are `synchronized` for good measure. That is the equivalent of wrapping the whole method body in `lock(this){...}` in C#.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213123289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/213124352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/952#issuecomment-213124352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/952","id":213124352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzEyNDM1Mg==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T21:43:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T21:43:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This LGTM now.
