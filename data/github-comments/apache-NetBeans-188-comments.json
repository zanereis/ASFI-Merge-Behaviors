The infinite \"background scanning\" is gone, but the issue is not.\r\n\r\nExcluding as many files from the project as you can as well as increasing the default cache/heap sizes used to help, but that's obviously only hiding the underlying issue... and nowadays I can't really tell the difference between increased cache size or not. Perhaps my current main project's size is just too large for it to make a difference anymore.\r\n\r\nPersonally I've gotten somewhat used to finding the class I need in the tab bar and using ctrl+f rather than ctrl+click, it's infinitely faster. And thanks to windows' win+v clipboard history I don't have to worry about copying the method name that I want to find :sweat_smile:....\r\n\r\nThe sad fact is - if you want to work on big projects you gotta switch to PHP Storm. There have been bug reports, stack overflow threads, wiki articles (now available only on web archive due to the apache overtake) and no fix for 10 years.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1804323017/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1804778583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6634#issuecomment-1804778583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6634","id":1804778583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5rkrxX","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T22:24:33Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T22:24:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It would be nice if someone could provide an example project to reproduce it.

If the required data is indeed cached then it must be purged after mere seconds.\n\nI will admit that I found ctrl+b to be more reliable, but not necessarily faster. I feel like it completes successfully more often than ctrl+click, while the latter tends to just abort multiple times.\n\nThere are issues with autocomplete and refactoring as well that would be explained by NetBeans failing to resolve some metadata, however I refrain from mentioning this too often, because I believe there's a common underlying issue.

Essentially, first clone Magento (the largest PHP open source project I'm aware of), initialize its Composer dependencies and then beef it up even more by adding additional dependencies known to be large:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/magento/magento2.git .\r\n\r\ncomposer install\r\n\r\ncomposer require aws/aws-php-sns-message-validator:* facebook/graph-sdk:* facebook/php-business-sdk:* google/apiclient:* nikic/php-parser:* phing/phing:* php-coord/php-coord:* phpoffice/phpspreadsheet:*\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1812288621/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1812517613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6399#issuecomment-1812517613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6399","id":1812517613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5sCNLt","user":{"login":"bob-tee","id":116080682,"node_id":"U_kgDOButAKg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116080682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee","html_url":"https://github.com/bob-tee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob-tee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-15T13:13:58Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T13:13:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I came across this today using Netbeans 19.\r\n\r\nI have a Web App that I deploy into Tomcat.

Also a lot of consequent navigation (clicking back and forth, like OP described) causes similar problems.\r\n> \r\n> I've come up with a quick way to initialize a large project for testing.
