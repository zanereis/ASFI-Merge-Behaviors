Two additional JIRAs (2374, 2375) address other components necessary for the full distributed version. Until then, it doesn't make much sense to have more extensive tests. I did, however, manually verify by changing the Worker to use this implementation then running the system tests using that version. Not sure if we want something more intermediate until the other two patches are in place or if we should just leave it to the last one to integrate them all and test them

I have made changes so this PR now users KafkaPrincipal. One open issue is how to handle multiple owners. I originally tested by using , as separator in the test. However I realized this won't work from CLI as CLI already uses , to distinguish different keys e.g.\n\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --create  --zookeeper localhost:2181  --topic owner-test-config-3 --partitions 1 --config owners=User:alice,flush.ms=10000 will work as we are only specifying one owner.\n\nHowever bin/kafka-topics.sh --create  --zookeeper localhost:2181  --topic owner-test-config-3 --partitions 1 --config owners=User:alice,User:Bob,flush.ms=10000 will not work as CLI will try to match User:Bob as Key=Val and fail with \"all configs to be added must be in the format \"key=val\"\" Exception. \n\nWe could either use some different delimiter or just add --owner as a new option.
