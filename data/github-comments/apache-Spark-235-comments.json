I guess this is okay, but it it would be better to write directly to a serialized stream in this case. And then we'd have to track whether that becomes too big to store as well.\n\nAlso, it seems like in this case, even if the array of non-serialized elements fits in memory, we allocate a bit of extra space as we write the objects to a byte stream. Not horrible but it's another reason to try to serialize directly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49682053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49682150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1379#issuecomment-49682150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1379","id":49682150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjgyMTUw","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-21T23:59:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-21T23:59:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it fails due to the apache license is not in the test file.

we have to, we could probably somehow package `pep8` and its dependencies as a standalone. It's doable but I think also a bit ugly and harder to update.\n\nAs for adding to the Jenkins scripts, shall I take a crack at that in a separate PR? \n\nHow are you thinking we approach that? There are at least a couple of things we could do, like:\n- update `/dev/run-tests` to include `pep8` checks directly\n- update `/dev/run-tests` to call a `pythonstyle` script under `/dev/`\n\nWe should probably update step 4 under [\"Contributing Code\"](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Contributing+to+Spark#ContributingtoSpark-ContributingCode) in the \"Contributing to Spark Guide\" to cover Python style as well.\n\nAlso, would it make sense to replace `sbt/sbt scalastyle` with a new `check-style` script in `/dev/` that checks style for both Scala and Python code?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49698547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49698613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1519#issuecomment-49698613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1519","id":49698613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njk4NjEz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-22T05:03:53Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T05:03:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1519:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/16940/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49698613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49698681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1505#issuecomment-49698681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1505","id":49698681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njk4Njgx","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-22T05:05:22Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T05:05:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's definitely add the pep8 check in a separate PR.
