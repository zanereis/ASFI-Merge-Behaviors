this is a bit tricky. For type annotation, we should use `DFPattern` in this case. However, in Python 3.6, it evaluates the annotations at function definition time. It means if we define a class and refer it in the same file, the type checking won't find that class and will report type errors. While this issue has been fixed in Python 3.7, an official workaround is using a string for the class type. You can see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15853469/putting-current-class-as-return-type-annotation for details.\r\n\r\nSince TVM hasn't officially required Python 3.7+, I'd make sure the type annotation we are using is Python 3.6 compatible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/637038571/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/637079716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5709#issuecomment-637079716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5709","id":637079716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzA3OTcxNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-01T20:17:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T20:17:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @liangfu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/637079716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/637083244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5634#issuecomment-637083244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5634","id":637083244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzA4MzI0NA==","user":{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-01T20:24:54Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T20:24:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbaret Thanks for your comment and sorry for my slow response.

To provide better performance, it supports multiple optimization profiles for different shape range. Say your input is 1d ranged from 1 to 1024. You can create profiles whatever shape you specified, overlap or non-overlap, e.g.\r\n```\r\n(1, 8, 16)    -> this profile is valid for 1 to 16, specifically optimized of 8 \r\n(16, 24, 32)\r\n(33, 48, 63)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nUsers can manually select profile to use. In terms of https://sampl.cs.washington.edu/tvmconf/slides/2019/Jared-Roesch-Haichen-Shen-RelayVM.pdf I have some questions, `Representing Dynamism` is solved by shape function, but how do I manually represent a constrained dynamism?
