I'm not quite sure I understand the problem you are trying to solve, but that likely my own lack of NXS knowledge.\nThe last time I changed this plugin (NiciraNvp), I've added an integration tests for checking is redirects within a cluster were being followed. You change probably doesn't impact that, but it would be great to make sure. Can you please run the test (`test/integration/smoke/test_nicira_controller.py`, let me know if you need help in getting the test running) in your setup and report on the results?\nIn addition, it would be great of you document the problem you are trying to fix by adding a new integration tests (that fails before your change is applied and succeeds afterwards).\n\nA final remark about the code and the commits, please see my comments on certain lines, and consider rearranging your commits in such a way that what you did and/or the intention behind each commit become clear.\n\nThanks again, and do let me know if I can hep you further.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/148639781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/148661785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/884#issuecomment-148661785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/884","id":148661785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODY2MTc4NQ==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-16T09:08:20Z","updated_at":"2015-10-16T09:08:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@remibergsma This PR is marked as closed, but it was actually reverted.\n\nAlthough it's not a bugfix, it is a fix for the Unit Tests on Windows.
