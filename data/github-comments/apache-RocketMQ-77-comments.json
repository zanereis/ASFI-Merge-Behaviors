think that maybe my English is not good enough to express myself fully.\r\nForgive me for using Chinese next.\r\n\r\n@caigy \r\n> * `org.apache.rocketmq.client.impl.factory.MQClientInstance#brokerAddrTable`\r\n> * `org.apache.rocketmq.client.impl.factory.MQClientInstance#topicRouteTable`\r\n\r\n以上两个map是 `ConcurrentMap` ，应该不存在并发问题。\r\n> * `persistAllConsumerOffset()` also calling `updateTopicRouteInfoFromNameServer()`\r\n\r\n我想你指的是：\r\n```\r\n    FindBrokerResult findBrokerResult = this.mQClientFactory.findBrokerAddressInAdmin(mq.getBrokerName());\r\n    if (null == findBrokerResult) {\r\n        this.mQClientFactory.updateTopicRouteInfoFromNameServer(mq.getTopic());\r\n        findBrokerResult = this.mQClientFactory.findBrokerAddressInAdmin(mq.getBrokerName());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n达成这个条件的前提时当前brokerAddrTable内的数据是正确的。比如在执行`persistAllConsumerOffset()`时若是broker-b正好出现网络故障，此时由于没有去更细brokerAddrTable，findBrokerResult仍然能取到值，从而不会进入if条件。\r\n\r\n我现在遇到的问题是，我在使用双主双从的RocketMQ集群做容灾测试的时候发现，在拔掉一台服务器的网线后（A主和B从）,MQ大约需要两分钟以后才能够恢复正常的生产和消费。这在企业级应用中是无法容忍的，因此我尝试缩短了一些源码中的超时判断时间，例如：\r\n* org.apache.rocketmq.namesrv.routeinfo.RouteInfoManager#BROKER_CHANNEL_EXPIRED_TIME\r\n* org.apache.rocketmq.broker.client.ProducerManager#CHANNEL_EXPIRED_TIMEOUT\r\n* org.apache.rocketmq.broker.client.ConsumerManager#CHANNEL_EXPIRED_TIMEOUT\r\n等等\r\n\r\n但是接踵而来的问题是我发现容灾恢复的时间忽快忽慢，于是我增加了一些调试信息找到了导致MQ恢复慢的问题主要在于：\r\n`MQClientInstance`里的单线程池在执行定时任务时如果正好执行到`persistAllConsumerOffset()`时发生了服务器断网，由于我有大量的queue他需要一个一个的去持久化，会导致其他定时任务，例如`updateTopicRouteInfoFromNameServer()`在很长的时间内（大约2分钟）不会去执行。在此期间consumer的rebalance无法正确执行，从而不能恢复消费。\r\n**源码中的这种执行方式很大程度上限制了RocketMQ的容灾恢复速度。**\r\n\r\n所以，如果`MQClientInstance`中的这几个定时任务能够拆分执行的话我建议把`persistAllConsumerOffset()`拆出来单独执行。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/884776782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/884846562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3032#issuecomment-884846562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3032","id":884846562,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl840va_i","user":{"login":"guyinyou","id":36399867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Mzk5ODY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36399867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou","html_url":"https://github.com/guyinyou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyinyou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-22T11:39:06Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T11:39:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IMO，the

返回的结果是？\r\n> \r\n> 如果某个异常msg被投递到重试队列了，那么offset的值如何更新？是保持不动，还是更新最新的offset？\r\n> 1）如果offset保持不动，那么consumer需要等待此msg的再次被投递，但是若此msg处理时一直出错，且超过重试次数和时间（最长15分钟），那么此queue上的消息是否会因此被阻塞？\r\n> 2）如果offset发生变化，那么此消息再次被投递进queue后，此时队列中的offset就是此msg的offset吧，consumer会不会出现重复消费？（除非broker被设计成有状态的，类似于RabbitMQ那样消费成功就ack掉，从内存中移除）\r\n> \r\n> 如果您有时间，还请帮我指点迷津，这个问题困扰我好久了，非常感谢：）\r\n\r\n1、ackIndex=-1，会把消费的一批消息（consumeRequest.getMsgs()）都放到重算队列里面重试（retry）队列消费。原理就是把消费失败的消息topic替换根据consumerGroup和topic生成成retry topic，放到一个内部队列当中，broker端定时任务扫描内部重试队列，到时间会重新发到真实的topic当中\r\n2、consumeRequest.getMsgs()并没有空。long offset = consumeRequest.getProcessQueue().removeMessage(consumeRequest.getMsgs())返回最近需要消费的offset，broker也会更新到这个最新的offset\r\n3、普通消息无论消费成功失败都会更新offset，并且更新到broker，消费失败的消息调用this.sendMessageBack告诉broker，放到retry队列，不会影响后面的消息消费。顺序消息如果消费失败才会不断重试，否则顺序无法保证\r\n4、mq实现消息语义未at least once，因此可能产生重复，需要消费业务端做幂等","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/885506742/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/885540631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3120#issuecomment-885540631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3120","id":885540631,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl840yEcX","user":{"login":"lwclover","id":4252409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTI0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4252409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover","html_url":"https://github.com/lwclover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lwclover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-23T10:16:48Z","updated_at":"2021-07-23T10:16:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@duhenglucky

@guyinyou \r\nAs all of the brokers set the autoCreateTopicEnable false, So I just change the method \"updateTopicRouteInfoFromNameServer\" as follow(MQClientInstance line 358), instead of changing the log level of 'RocketmqClient' to 'ERROR':\r\n```java\r\n        for ( String topic : topicList ) {\r\n            if ( StringUtils.equals(topic, TopicValidator.AUTO_CREATE_TOPIC_KEY_TOPIC) ) {\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n            this.updateTopicRouteInfoFromNameServer(topic);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nSuggestion 1:\r\nIn my opinion, it is no necessary to update the TBW102 topic route info here. If the autoCreateTopicEnable set true, when send message, if the topic is not exist, it will update TBW102 topic route info first(DefaultMQProducerImpl.sendDefaultImpl() line 566).\r\n\r\nSuggestion 2(I haven't tested this method ):\r\nChange the constructor of TopicConfigManager, Just put the TBW102 to the topicConfigTable, then when broker start, it will regist the TBW102 to the nameserver.\r\nIf the autoCreateTopicEnable set false, if the topic is not exist, when the message send to the broker, it will invoke the method of TopicConfigManager.createTopicInSendMessageMethod, this method will check if the defaultTopic is TBW102 and the autoCreateTopicEnable is true（TopicConfigManager line 170）, if the autoCreateTopicEnable is false, it will return null topicConfig. It won't auto create topic either.
