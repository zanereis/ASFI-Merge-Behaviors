The \"old way\" was to build the redistribution jars once and cache them on the binary server. I would not do that anymore. In the last days we learnt the hard way, that we should not rely on external systems (yes I know maven central belongs to that group).\r\n\r\nHere is what I would do: Cover `servletjspapi` and `web.jspparser` in one PR (#906 is not enough) as they are both build similar and belong tightly together.\r\n\r\nYou already identified the API modules, but they need integration into the build process. Please see `enterprise/web.core.syntax` for a similar case. In that module the taglibs are downloaded from maven central and the documentation, that is then redistributed with netbeans, is build as `external/generated-*` (see `prepare-doc` target).\r\n\r\nFor `servletjspapi` you already identified the source file from maven central. These need to be filtered/unified as done in the `web.jspparser/build.xml` and a grouped license file needs to be created as in the reference module.\r\n\r\nThe sources for `web.jspparser` module are also available on maven central:\r\nJasper/JSP API: https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.glassfish.web/javax.servlet.jsp/2.3.4/jar\r\nEL: https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.glassfish.web/javax.el/2.2.6/jar\r\nPreprocessor-Util: https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.glassfish.main.common/common-util/5.0/glassfish-jar\r\nClassLoaderUtil: https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.glassfish.main.common/glassfish-ee-api/5.0/glassfish-jar\r\n\r\nThese jars need to be recombined and produces also a `generated*` file. \r\n\r\nThe parser has unittests and I ask you to run them before and after your changes, to check that the parser still works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/424487358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/424509260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/898#issuecomment-424509260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/898","id":424509260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDUwOTI2MA==","user":{"login":"svenreimers","id":919793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/919793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers","html_url":"https://github.com/svenreimers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenreimers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-25T21:33:37Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T21:33:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok.

I have a couple of questions though : \r\n1) What should be the license for the new jars created after unification? Do they even require a license, as they are built in runtime ?\r\n2) Does the target `create-jars-from-glassfish` in web.jspparser even executed anytime? I ask this because it tries to unify the jars from `{glassfish_location}` the value of which looks like a local address `/home/marfous/Programs/AppServers/glassfish-4.0-b84-custom` that doesn't even exist.\r\n\r\nI have created a target `build-init` for unification of jars in both servletjspapi and web.jspparser\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like the tests are broken for web.jspparser module, because I tried to run the unit tests with and without my changes and I see that in both the cases, it tries to unzip `project3.zip` from `test/unit/data` which isn't present. I am looking into this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/425377178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/425386720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/920#issuecomment-425386720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/920","id":425386720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTM4NjcyMA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T09:58:50Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T09:58:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is not for master but for release10 branch, once Laszlo creates it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/425386720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/425387995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/917#issuecomment-425387995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/917","id":425387995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTM4Nzk5NQ==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T10:04:02Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T10:04:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, I think this is a great idea - but the patch is adding the libraries to the standard (platform) build, no?
