It seems `micrometer` will not automatically manage those dynamically-generated metrics for us.\r\n> \r\n> First of all, we may use constant name and dynamic tags, e.g. workflow_id to generate metrics dynamically.\r\n> \r\n> Secondly, I plan to use a class `DynamicMetricsManager` to provide a method to instantiate metrics during runtime. `DynamicMetricsManager` uses `ConcurrentHashMap` to store those dynamic metrics.\r\n> \r\n> Thirdly, when workflow / task instance finished, `DynamicMetricsManager` will remove related metrics from `ConcurrentHashMap` and put them into `Caffeine Cache` with `expireAfterAcess` larger than `Prometheus` pull interval to manage the life cycle of those dynamic metrics and avoid memory explosion.\r\n> \r\n> WDYT? @ruanwenjun\r\n\r\nI think there could be a better solution.\r\n\r\nWe give users ability to choose whether monitor a specific workflow or not on UI. DS will generate related metrics for a specific workflow only if users choose to. This is more reasonable because users definitely do not need to monitor every workflow / task in detail. Furthermore, in this way DS will not waste memory use for useless metrics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1169747224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1169771383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10578#issuecomment-1169771383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10578","id":1169771383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5FuUt3","user":{"login":"feixiameiruhua","id":19662221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjYyMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19662221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua","html_url":"https://github.com/feixiameiruhua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feixiameiruhua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-29T09:48:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T01:07:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

I think this is the bug of 2.0.5. It has been solved in #10541 and will be released in 2.0.6\r\n\r\n@JinyLeeChina  I switch to the branch `2.0.6-prepare` and test it. The problem still exists. Please check it again. Thanks.\r\n\r\n### The topology\r\nThere are three process pA, pB and pC. \r\n- pA has a task pAt1\r\n- pB has a dependent task pBt1 depending on pAt1\r\n- pC has a task pCt1 that is long running task\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce it?\r\n- start pB\r\n- start pC\r\n- stop pC\r\n- start pA and pA finished\r\n- finally, In the UI you can see that the dependent task pBt1 always running\r\n\r\nThe detail to start pC:\r\n<img width=\"836\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12637868/176584789-af83ecfc-9606-4c77-b706-ff7caa7829ad.png\">\r\n\r\n### The reason\r\nAll `WorkflowExecuteThread` instances share the same `depStateCheckList `. When pC starting with failedStartegy `End`, you stop it then the `depStateCheckList` be all cleared. **The correct logic is only clearing the taskinstance belong to pC**.\r\n\r\nThe critical Code in `WorkflowExecuteThread` based on `2.0.6-prepare`:\r\n`org.apache.dolphinscheduler.server.master.runner.WorkflowExecuteThread#processStateChangeHandler`\r\n<img width=\"752\" alt=\"image\"
