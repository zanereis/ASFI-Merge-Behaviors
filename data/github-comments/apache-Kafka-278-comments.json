@hachikuji This enables the request logger (and a few others, both uncommented and commented in the default `log4j.properties`) and directed at `NullAppender`. This exercises the code around them, especially the request logger all the way at `TRACE` level, but doesn't affect any output.\r\n\r\nThis causes tests to correctly fail if something is wrong with the logging. In the unit tests, `kafka.network.SocketServerTest.testGracefulClose` fails because it expects a response. In the integration tests, a ton of things fail.\r\n\r\nThis definitely isn't perfect since redirecting to a `NullAppender` kind of hides the cause, but at least it doesn't let bad commits through. This isn't ideal, but at least people familiar with the issue will be able to track the issue down. (We could also add a note to the unit test about modifying the loggers if we think that would be useful in debugging future issues.)\r\n\r\nI can't tell precisely what log4j considers public API, but this `NullAppender` has been around for a long time with a total of 2 commits, so seems reliable. Still, if people aren't sure about it, we can pull a copy into the tests given that it's a trivial nop implementation
