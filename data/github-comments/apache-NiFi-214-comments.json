There's the possibility of introducing a migration script to be run on flows when upgrading to 2.x which would translate the implementation name.

@exceptionfactory ! I noticed the CodeQL issues as well...\n\nI did sanitize the Filename header value before passing it to any code that would use it to write a File. \n\nIf that isn't enough then I suppose a fall back option would be to write the file names with the generated UUID and store some kind of mapping file along side the asset that contains the original filename. \n\nThe problem with this is that the value of the parameter that references the asset is going to be the concatenated paths of the assets and it's going to contain file names that the user has no idea what they are. Example, upload PostgresDriver.jar and it generates id 123, then reference this asset in a parameter named db_driver, and the value of the parameter will be '/path/to/assets/123'. So some looking at the parameter has no idea what file that is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2265132392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2265304821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9138#issuecomment-2265304821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9138","id":2265304821,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6HBc71","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-02T12:44:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T12:44:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reply @bbende.

I believe the discussion took place on Slack but it's too old to retrieve from the Apache NiFi Slack as we don't have the pro version. Basically the idea is to provide a sort of \"linked-list adjacency\" that you see implemented fully as \"index-free adjacency\" in graph databases. Currently the lineage computation involves getting every event for a FlowFile, then sorting by timestamp, then repeating for all parent and child FlowFiles. This is too slow for determining an entire provenance graph. Consider GenerateFlowFile -> UpdateAttribute -> UpdateAttribute -> <whatever>, the UUID for the FlowFile remains the same but to tell which UpdateAttribute came first, you have to sort them by time. previousEventIds is used to enable a sort of \"on-the-fly\" streaming behavior to stream new provenance events into a graph database without having to re-link any of the previous nodes, just adding new nodes and links from the previous event(s) to the new one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2282878687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2282894218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9171#issuecomment-2282894218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9171","id":2282894218,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6IEjOK","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-11T21:23:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-11T21:23:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Understood on Slack.  It is well understood about that limitation.  Please put the necessary context in the PR or JIRA so reviewers can participate and/or know their comments are being factored in.  You can copy/paste from slack.\r\n\r\nI better understand the intent based on your recent comment.  Effectively while the key information is provided in our current provenance event/flowfile model it puts too much strain on the destination database to determine what the lineage graph looked like in terms of ordering.  This is because we provide the necessary relationships and timestamps but it would require the downstream database to reconstruct them once all events are completed as timestamp is currently a key indicator of order of operations for a given set of events associated with a single flow file.\r\n\r\nI can see how this could be beneficial to resolve.\r\n\r\nWhat other solutions were considered to address this?\r\n\r\nThe proposed change creates a link by the long identifier of all possible 'previous' events for a given provenance event and adds an alternative linkage over the current model which is purely based on the relationship of a flow file, the type of event, and any parent flowfiles from which it stems.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is ordering within the lifespan of a single flowfile.  That seems solvable with a single 'previous event identifier'.  In the case the previous event identifier is not established this is the start of this flowfile's life.  That could mean it was a created flowfile or it was the result of various different sources being combined into a new child object.  We already know and capture the parent flowfile identifier so this chain can be followed by the downstream database.\r\n\r\nI left a couple comments as it relates to changes in the abstractions as well (Abstract repository, UpdateableEvent...). It isn't clear to me why such changes are desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2282894218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2283953121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9168#issuecomment-2283953121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9168","id":2283953121,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6IIlvh","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-12T13:13:49Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T13:13:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Reviewers are also responsible for evaluating and testing, but it is important for authors to do the initial work.\r\n\r\nThe [NiFi Registry Admin Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-registry-docs/html/administration-guide.html#user_authentication) provides details on configuring security integrated with LDAP as one option. Unfortunately, NiFi Registry does not support the single-user style of authentication that NiFi provides, so I understand it requires more work to setup a test scenario.\r\n\r\nWith that background, I am closing this pull request for now, but feel free to reopen after running some tests with different types of inputs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2293952119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2294279614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9122#issuecomment-2294279614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9122","id":2294279614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6Iv-2-","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-16T21:04:46Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T21:04:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory Thanks for accepting this PR and merging.
