comments from previous conversations that I think might be good to post here for public discussions.\r\n\r\n# Merging Metric and Loss\r\nThe current proposal serialize a list of metrics inside a loss object. An alternative proposal is to unify metric and loss. A `Metric` is an object that\r\n\r\n- support `forward` that maps inputs to a scalar\r\n- support `backward` that by default is NOP (i.e. zero gradient)\r\n\r\nA `Loss` is a subclass of `Metric`, that has meaningful `backward` implementation.\r\n\r\nWhen constructing module, a list of `Metric` can be given. During training and scoring, all the metrics will be `forward` evaluated. During training, all the `Loss` will be `backward` evaluated to provide initial gradient for back-prop.\r\n\r\nSo the effective loss is the sum of all `Loss` subclasses in the list metrics supplied.\r\n\r\n# Layer and SimpleLayer\r\nI think it might be good to rename Layer to BaseLayer, and SimpleLayer to Layer, as the user will mostly be interacting with `Layer`. \r\n\r\nThe `simple_forward` function, which supports both NDArray forward and symbolic forward, might be renamed to `mixed_forward` or `generic_forward` (name coming from C++ generics). \r\n\r\n# Whether to provide a built-in `fit` function\r\nThe current `fit` implementation on Module is actually simple. However, it looks complicated because tooooooo many keyword arguments are added to that function. One way to potentially avoid this is to ask users to always write their own training loop, which should be fairly straightforward. \r\n\r\nTo make common scenarios simple to use. We can provide a training loop code template, from which user can copy & paste and customize at will. Alternative, we could provide a simplified `fit` function, with only a few arguments, and state in the doc encouraging the user to write their own training loop if extension is needed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/301884906/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/301886140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6275#issuecomment-301886140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6275","id":301886140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTg4NjE0MA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T19:13:42Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T19:13:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`why

Sure, I agree that implementing a function for early stopping is not quite difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever, my feeling is that early-stopping is a common feature in lots of other deep learning frameworks, and we even have that in R.  So this will be nice if we can have something similar that can make python users' life easier, too. Except for this, beginners who used other frameworks may find this more friendly. I've tried to make the new class multi-functional that can accept few useful parameters and should also be able to handle built-in metrics automatically.\r\n\r\nExcept for this, the other question we are facing now is that you can use callback functions for saving checkpoints of the model for early stopping, however, these callback functions cannot stop the fitting function without some minor modifications in base_module.py. This is also something that has also been covered in #6304
