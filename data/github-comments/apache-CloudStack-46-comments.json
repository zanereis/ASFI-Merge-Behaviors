Your change would generate an SQL such as this one (if I try to forcefully delete the domain %): \nselect \\* from domain where path like \"%replace('/%/','%','[%]')%\"\n\nI have not tested on my environment, but just by looking how the SQLs are generated and how the filter values are set (using prepared statements), that does not seem to work.

For the test user, it doesn't really check connection availability. It's more about the users, as the name suggested.\n\nConcerning the VPC VPN, it tests quite a lot. It creates a VPC and adds 1 VM to it, then it creates a VPN on the source nat IP and adds 1 VPN user to it. It doesn't test connection though. That would have to be done manually or we have to write a Python VPN client connection inside the test code.\n\nIn respect to the test_vpc_site2site_vpn test, it creates 2 VPCs, 2 networks, 2 VMs and 2 VPNs - on each source nat ip address. The cool thing is that the test connects the VPCs to each other, so testing the VPN connection in this case.\n\nWould that cover your changes, @jayapalu ?\n\nWhat do you think, @remibergsma @miguelaferreira @DaanHoogland ?\n\nIf it indeed cover the changes, I'm glad to give a :+1: \n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/138483590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/138486754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/685#issuecomment-138486754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/685","id":138486754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODQ4Njc1NA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T09:02:41Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T09:02:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats #541](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-rats/541/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/138486754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/138491884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/772#issuecomment-138491884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/772","id":138491884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODQ5MTg4NA==","user":{"login":"jayapalu","id":3789214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODkyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3789214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu","html_url":"https://github.com/jayapalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jayapalu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T09:17:01Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T09:17:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wilderrodrigues Configuring  remote access vpn and vpn users is success in test cases that covers the code changes.

testing would require some usage data; and global settings (search for quota in the UI) that are similar to usage ones, there is an enable setting you set it to true and rest are self-explanatory. In the UI you goto ui/plugins/plugins.js and enable the UI plugin and you can browse the quota statement, credits etc via the UI. You start by deploying a usage/mgmt server with some usage data that is not processed (the quota_calculated column will be false or zero), you set a tariff with some effective date (you can set this directly in the cloud_usage database's quota_tariff table with some values, the quota types are same as usage types) and add some quota credits to an account (say admin); the next time usage aggregation thread runs, quota calculation thread would run next and basically tell you how much you've consumed, in case a threshold is reached like quota is low or exhausted it would send out emails and/or lock accounts based on global or account level settings etc. \n\nIn summary if someone wants to have a DigitalOcean kind of simple credit/quota system, it is doable using this feature/plugin where quota or amounts are credited (prepaid) and they reduce over time based on actual cloud usage and a tariff. This feature does not support any credit card or payment gateway; so admins (globally) or domain admins (for a specific domain) can add credits to an account (on the flip side - to deduct, they can also add a negative credit).\n\n@abhinandanprateek can you add details on using the plugin on the admin docs https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-docs-admin/tree/master/source and/or on the FS as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/138788442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/138788885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/768#issuecomment-138788885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/768","id":138788885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODc4ODg4NQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T05:24:10Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T05:24:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just
