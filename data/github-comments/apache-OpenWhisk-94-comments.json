Wondering if anybody has put more thought into this; and also if someone could comment on my questions below:\r\n\r\n**How should the API behave with versioned entities?**\r\n\r\n`PUT /api/v1/namespaces/guest/actions/helloWorld`\r\n\r\n1. entity doesn't exist\r\n2. create entity with version 0.0.1\r\n\r\n&& then `PUT /api/v1/namespaces/guest/actions/helloWorld`\r\n1. entity exists\r\n2. no version specified\r\n3. mutate the latest version of the entity, or require a version to be specified?\r\n4. what mutations should be allowed? e.g. allow annotation updates but not code updates\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined to think changes should be disallowed to a versioned document without specification of the version\r\n\r\n**How should we name && refer to versioned entities?**\r\n\r\n/api/v1/namespaces/_ns_/_entity_/_name_/_version_\r\n\r\n`wsk action get /helloWorld/0.0.1`\r\n`wsk action get /guest/helloWorld` --> gets 0.0.2\r\n\r\nI'm not amped to tackle package versioning at the moment, but wondering if versioning for it would work as so:\r\n\r\n| Fully qualified name | Alias | Namespace | Package | Name | Version |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `/whisk.system/cloudant/0.0.5/read` |  | `/whisk.system` | `cloudant` | `read` | 0.0.5\r\n| `/myOrg/video/0.0.1/transcode` | `video/0.0.1/transcode/` | `/myOrg` | `video` | `transcode` | 0.0.1\r\n| `/myOrg/video/0.0.2/transcode` | `video/transcode` | `/myOrg` | `video` | `transcode` | 0.0.2\r\n \r\n**How to store versioned entities**\r\n\r\nI'm not very far into the codebase yet (and have little experience with CouchDB), but wonder if there is a clear \"best\" approach \r\n\r\n- keep the storage key as is and nest the versioned documents? guessing this is a bad approach.\r\n\r\nIf we add version to the storage key, how do we do quick lookups in the case of \"latest\" or no version specified, like in `wsk action get /guest/helloWorld` --> gets 0.0.2\r\n\r\n- can we just duplicate the document under both keys, `/guest/helloWorld/` and `/guest/helloWorld/0.0.2`\r\n\r\n- or maybe there is some secondary indexing available in the data store API?\r\n\r\n- something else?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/323412113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/323428711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2645#issuecomment-323428711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2645","id":323428711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzQyODcxMQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-18T18:31:50Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T18:31:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rabbah, I'd rather keep the pervious behavior.

A client certificate must be provided with CN equal to subject \r\n2. Every subject must have their own cert\r\n\r\nSo the installation of openwhisk supports two subjects: whisk.system and guest.

(client certificat auth is more security than auth key)\r\nyou can see i execute `wskadmin user create jack -ns whisk.namespace`, it will insert this user:`jack` to couchdb regardless of whether the client authentication is turned on or off\r\nthen, the user `jack` can use auth key auth when turn off client certificate.\r\nIn some condition, If the company has a better security certification needs , the company can turn on the client certificate. just generate corresponding user's the client certificate which its `CN` equal with `subject:jack`.\r\nhere, have an extra benefit, the client cerfitifate can be shared under different namespaces, which means, if  `jack` wants to access another namespace:`namespaceB`, there has no need to generate `namespaceB`'s `jack` client certificate, only do `wskadmin user create jack -ns namespaceB` is
