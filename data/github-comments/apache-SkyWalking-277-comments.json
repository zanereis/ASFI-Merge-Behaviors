problem, for what it's worth here are my suggestions:\r\n\r\n- Use our prebuilt Docker image instead of downloading on the fly, e.g.\r\n\r\n  ```Dockerfile\r\n  COPY --from=apache/skywalking-java-agent:8.9.0-alpine /skywalking/agent /path/to/your/desired/agent/location\r\n  # ...\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- `._` files are hidden so when you said `We did not see with ._apm-spring-concurrent-util-4.x-plugin-8.10.0.jar file anywhere in plugin,option plugins,activations.Not sure how _ underscore is coming.` make sure you use `ls -alh` to list all hidden files, also, these files are totally possible produced on your side please Google it first https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14980/why-are-dot-underscore-files-created-and-how-can-i-avoid-them\r\n\r\n- `Agent is downloaded in entrypoint.sh`, I don't think this is a good idea because you'll need to download the agent every time you start the app, which is unnecessary and sometimes it's inconsistent from time to time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1120701129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1120982499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9012#issuecomment-1120982499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9012","id":1120982499,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85C0NXj","user":{"login":"skundu1234","id":87635275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjM1Mjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87635275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234","html_url":"https://github.com/skundu1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skundu1234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T11:33:06Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T11:33:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
