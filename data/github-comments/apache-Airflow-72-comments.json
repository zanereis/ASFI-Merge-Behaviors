To answer your question, I'm having a hard time testing the changes in this PR.  I don't know if it is my build/install/test setup or if master is not stable at the moment.\r\n\r\nI have two ways I'm testing this.\r\n1. Building a docker container with airflow built from my github commit.\r\n    - I'm not testing that this fixes the bug, just that it does not introduce new bugs.\r\n    - There are some problems with basic functionality that I think are bugs in master (but could be a problem in my setup).\r\n2. Building and installing from this github commit on an AWS EC2 behind an ELB.\r\n    - I can verify that https redirects stay https.  This fixes the original problem.\r\n    - But I'm seeing the same problems with master that are breaking the UI and preventing any DAGs from starting.\r\n\r\nIf it's helpful at all, I created a github repo for running airflow as four separate components as well as redis and mysql using docker and docker-compose.\r\nhttps://github.com/dennisobrien/airflow-docker-compose-example\r\n\r\nThe `Dockerfile` has a section for building from the official release in PyPI, or from a github commit.\r\n\r\n- These succeed:\r\n    - pip installing 1.7.1.3 from PyPI\r\n    - Building/installing 1.7.1.3 from github source\r\n- These have problems (broken gui, jobs don't trigger)\r\n    - Building/installing from recent master has issues\r\n    - Building/installing from my feature branch\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed here.  I don't feel confident that my PR has no regressions.  I could try finding a recent master that is stable, play my commits on it, build and test from that.\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts are much appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nDennis\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/264059487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/264081155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1906#issuecomment-264081155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1906","id":264081155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDA4MTE1NQ==","user":{"login":"vijaysbhat","id":907344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat","html_url":"https://github.com/vijaysbhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T05:16:40Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T05:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin what operational metrics are you looking for?
