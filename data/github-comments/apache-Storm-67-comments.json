href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=atdixon\">atdixon</a>:</i>\n<p>A couple of notes on some of the code/design decisions in the current pull request.</p>\n\n<p>By supporting exhibitor, there will necessarily be two ways to configure Storm's connection to a Zookeeper cluster. Either you will configure a direct connection to zookeeper hosts or you will configure a connection to exhibitor host(s).</p>\n\n<p>I see two ways to offer this up from a configuration perspective:</p>\n\n<p>(1) You have <b>separate</b> connection properties for exhibitor servers and port that parallel those configuration options for zookeeper. This is how I chose to implement it in the current pull request. The properties are \"storm.exhibitor.servers\", \"storm.exhibitor.port\", \"storm.exhibitor.poll.millis\", and a few more.)</p>\n\n<p>In this case, when the exhibitor servers/port are provided, the \"storm.zookeeper.servers\" and \"storm.zookeeper.port\" configuration properties are not required but if present are used as backups in the exhibitor-configured client.</p>\n\n<p>This of course is backwards-compatible. All existing storm configurations that configure zookeeper directly will work as usual. Exhibitor is only used if configured.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Another design option would be to try to overload the existing \"storm.zookeeper.servers\" and \"storm.zookeeper.port\" properties by using a scheme for hosts. So for example you might indicate exhibitor servers via a configuration like so:</p>\n\n<p>storm.zookeeper.servers:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>\"exhibitor://127.0.0.1\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I think this is less desirable for a number of reasons. I think it is less explicit, less conventional. Also there will be always still be a need for \"storm.exhibitor.*\" properties to configure specific connection details unique to an exhibitor connection.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612530121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/78415948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/432#issuecomment-78415948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/432","id":78415948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NDE1OTQ4","user":{"login":"atdixon","id":340950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDk1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon","html_url":"https://github.com/atdixon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atdixon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-12T03:03:41Z","updated_at":"2015-03-12T03:03:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note:
