From what I can tell the other big python projects are not fully caching their conda installations either, at the very least not the dependencies themselves. I think the only compelling reason to cache the miniconda installation at this point is to prevent the build from failing due to download errors. In my own experience this has been very rare until recently, and the errors are always happening after conda gets updated. This is making me think that the problems are most likely some bug in the latest version of conda, so I think I will test this some more with an older version of conda and see how stable the build is. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261479505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261487424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1538#issuecomment-261487424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1538","id":261487424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTQ4NzQyNA==","user":{"login":"mfelgamal","id":10679887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjc5ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10679887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal","html_url":"https://github.com/mfelgamal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfelgamal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T09:32:23Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T09:39:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@1ambda I am already using automated build of dockerhub.

It would be awesome (although, not necessary) to have similar one to other Apache projects i.e BigTop, Ambari, etc. AFAIK they are still using a bit earlier one now.\n\nOther than that - it looks great to me, will be happy to mere it ASAP after 3 issues above are addressed, if there is no further discussion.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261742372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261744424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1639#issuecomment-261744424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1639","id":261744424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTc0NDQyNA==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-19T22:38:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T22:38:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bzz

Things you pointed out are very important. So I'v done some research about node and npm\n\nThe above screenshot is about LTS schedule. \n- Some apache projects use 4.x. but Active LTS will end before 2017.04 So they (should) move to 6.x If they really care about what they are building.\n- I used node [6.9.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/) in this PR. (one of LTS version for 6.x) That means, it (6.x) is somewhat stabilised. ([6.0.0  was released in 2016.04](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.0.0/))\n- **Basically, we use node as a tool**. **not the runtime**. In other words, we need something which can boost our productivity instead of very safe old one. For example, writing to build tools easily using es2015 ([6.9.1 supports es2015 99%](http://node.green/)) and supporting fast compilation ([6.0.0 load modules nearly four times faster than in v4](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.0.0/))\n\nRegard to npm\n- [npm 3.0.0 allow us to our dependencies to be installed maximally flat](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.0.0). (will increasae download speed + support local cache functionalities)\n- So we might use [node 5.x which shipped npm 3.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.0.0/) but 5.x is not the LTS version\n- Thus use 3.10.10 which is the most recent one. Even, we can use [4.0.3](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases) just released 2 days ago\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261759777/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/261759959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1659#issuecomment-261759959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1659","id":261759959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTc1OTk1OQ==","user":{"login":"heruka-urgyen","id":5688346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODgzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5688346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen","html_url":"https://github.com/heruka-urgyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heruka-urgyen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-20T05:25:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T05:25:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@1ambda
