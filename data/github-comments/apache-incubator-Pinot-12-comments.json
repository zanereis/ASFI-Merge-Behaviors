This is critical for improving scan performance on high cardinality columns e.g metrics and string columns where maintaining dictionary does not make sense.\n\nWhile our initial goal was to not expose Dictionary outside of data source, parts of existing code make direct reference to Dictionary. The No-Op dictionary can only work for columns with columns of int data type.\n\nWe should use this to fix the usage of dictionary class outside of data source. This will involve changes across all operators but I don't see any other option. But I think it's worth the effort, it will allow us to improve performance drastically in some scenarios.\n\nHere are my thoughts.\n\nMost operators work on Blocks and use the BlockValSet to read values. But unfortunately, they first read the dictionary ids \n`void readIntValues(int[] inDocIds, int inStartPos, int inDocIdsSize, int[] outDictionaryIds, int outStartPos);`\n\nand then use dictionary interface to read actual values.\n\n```\nvoid readIntValues(int[] dictionaryIds, int startPos, int limit, int[] outValues, int outStartPos);\n  void readLongValues(int[] dictionaryIds, int startPos, int limit, long[] outValues, int outStartPos);\n  void readDoubleValues(int[] dictionaryIds, int startPos, int limit, double[] outValues, int outStartPos);\n  void readFloatValues(int[] dictionaryIds, int startPos, int limit, float[] outValues, int outStartPos);\n  void readStringValues(int[] dictionaryIds, int startPos, int limit, String[] outValues, int outStartPos);\n```\n\nWe need to provide reading the actual value on block val set. This allows the data source to handle dictionary/no dictionary case transparently.\n\nThe downside of this is that some of the operators might benefit by using raw dictionaryId instead of actual value. Which means we have to provide both methods on blockValSet readDictionaryIds and readValues.\n\nI will give it a try and see how the interfaces look. We also have some usage of dictionary in filter phase but its much easier to push down that functionality to data source.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/252453669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/252456437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/664#issuecomment-252456437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/664","id":252456437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQ1NjQzNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-09T00:39:41Z","updated_at":"2016-10-09T00:39:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Current coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/linkedin/pinot/pull/664?src=pr) is 64.22% (diff: 100%)\n\n> No coverage report found for **master** at 6770a5e.\n> \n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io?src=pr).
