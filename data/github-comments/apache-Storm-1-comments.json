So I just think writing metrics to DBs ,it's useful for my monitoring system and it's enough for me to analysis the nodal load of workers.<br/>\nWriting metrics to DBs is simply a matter of choice , it's enough for some usage scenarios but it's not best for all usage scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>And well ,  I have thinked about sending metrics to Ganglia.And I'm just thinking about how to combine Ganglia

Looking at the stack trace it is caused by curator saying it took too long for zookeeper to connect to the ensemble and it timed out.  In this case it is waiting for Zookeeper to call back into the watcher to say that it has syncConnected.  So this may be an issue with zookeeper, or curator has missed some other connection mode, or it could be that you actually don't have a full quorum and zk is doing the correct thing and not connecting.  Say you have 2 zk nodes and one of them is down.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612445378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612445381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4022#issuecomment-2612445381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4022","id":2612445381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NDUzODE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-20T18:35:18Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:43:37Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

This is a ZK feature.  If you want to file a JIRA under ZOOKEEPER or CURATOR that would be the correct place for this error message to come out.  From the storm perspective we have little knowledge as to why curator threw the exception.

I also tried clojure 1.5.1 and got the same result, but 1.6.0-alpha3 appears to have my fix in.  Not that we should move to that release, just that the corner case will be fixed eventually.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31466183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31466720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/14#issuecomment-31466720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/14","id":31466720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDY2NzIw","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-02T17:05:33Z","updated_at":"2014-01-02T17:05:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just as a side note, all of the unit tests pass with 1.6.0-alpha3 :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31466720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31469595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/14#issuecomment-31469595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/14","id":31469595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDY5NTk1","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-02T17:43:46Z","updated_at":"2014-01-02T17:43:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also have found a couple of annoyances/regressions compared to the lein build.

I describe some suggestions for DRPC client. Firstly, there is a pool named 'DPCClientPool' which realizes the reuse of TTransport. Secondly, it is better this pool can hide different DRPC servers with auto load balance, maybe like new DPCClientPool(\"drpc.server1,drpc.server2,drpc.server3\").</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612430315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31681956","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/14#issuecomment-31681956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/14","id":31681956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjgxOTU2","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-06T20:06:13Z","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:06:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@revans2 \nRe: thrift7 -- I think that's a good plan for now. The Storm thrift API does not change that often so I think it is okay. Do you know where that fork lives? It would be good to know what was changed in that fork so we can compare it against newer thrift versions.\n\nAlso, I was able to confirm that there is an issue with the maven-clojure-plugin, specifically with `clojure:test-with-junit`. If there are test suites with failures among ones that pass, the plugin may not fail the build.\n\nI submitted a quick fix:\n\nhttps://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin/pull/75\n\nIn the meantime, we can work around it by using `clojure:test` instead of `clojure:test-with-junit`. The only difference is that with `clojure:test` we would not get clojure tests in the maven test report, but that is not a big deal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31681956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31686435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/14#issuecomment-31686435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/14","id":31686435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjg2NDM1","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-06T20:59:52Z","updated_at":"2014-01-06T20:59:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptgoetz \nThanks for all of the leg work on this.
