do not know how to fix this for Glue because it hides all nodes from management. But I know how to fix this error for EMR.\r\nThe source article is - https://aws.amazon.com/ru/blogs/big-data/apply-record-level-changes-from-relational-databases-to-amazon-s3-data-lake-using-apache-hudi-on-amazon-emr-and-aws-database-migration-service/\r\n\r\nSee the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o116.save.\r\n: org.apache.hudi.hive.HoodieHiveSyncException: Cannot create hive connection jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.hive.HoodieHiveClient.createHiveConnection(HoodieHiveClient.java:553)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt means that all nodes inside the cluster try to connect to localhost e.g, themselves and fail.\r\n\r\n**The solution for EMR**\r\n\r\nCall [ListInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_ListInstances.html) with EMR ClusterId and InstanceGroupTypes MASTER. Then grab PrivateIpAddress (`Json path is $.Instances[0].PrivateIpAddress`). And path this as hudi config parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--hoodie-conf hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.jdbcurl=jdbc:hive2://111.111.111.111:10000\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this, all cluster nodes will connect to the master and sync table.\r\n\r\nCouple of notes:\r\n1) I used hudi version 0.7 from amazon and hive/glue catalog sync worked without any problems. But when I move to 0.9.0 I see no new partitions. I just changed the version nothing else. Also another application with new 0.9.0 version needs IP address manipulation.\r\n2) I can not say how my fixes can be applied to glue job. Sorry. Try to connect to aws support and tell them that you need to get master node IP address before submit a job. Something tells me to run some code to get IP addresses and add hudi config programmatically - but is it possible to access glue job master node IP? I do not know. :-(\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/991731335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/991829623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4283#issuecomment-991829623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4283","id":991829623,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47Hh53","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-12T03:43:16Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T03:43:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@york-yu-ctw : Can you raise a support ticket against redshift? looks like hudi::ParsedFilename::IsValidCommitTimestamp has to be fixed when using 0.10.0. \r\nunfortunately, we did not guard the change behind a config. we have to fix it forward.

How to make the cleaner delete the data, and the deletion of the data will affect the time travial. \r\n2. How to make hudi archive instant, once instant is archived, it will affect the use of active timeline. \r\n\r\nSometimes users still need to have a clear understanding of their configuration, just as enable archive files number will lose historical instant information, same as time travial to cleaner.**(Of course we need to remind users in the document)**\r\n\r\nFortunately, users have options to use this function according on their own circumstances. If users need to keep all instant information, just disable it. If the user does not care about the instant after the archive, they can turn it on and keep a smaller value. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think the loss of information is inevitable, and we cannot keep all the data forever. The questions are when and how.\r\n\r\nOf course, the improvement you mentioned is very reasonable such as let hoodie implement append archive files function for unsupport-append dfs.\r\n\r\nDo you think we need to  get it done in this PR or maybe we can walk step by step to reach the final state. \r\nBy the way we need to take care of performance issue which is very important for Streaming Job.\r\n\r\n(1) Rewrite the archived timeline content into a smaller number of files --> will lead a archive file write amplify\r\n(2) When deleting the archived files, make sure the table does not have any corresponding base or log files from the contained instants, so there is essentially no information loss of the table states ---> maybe need to list and collect all the table data files name which is heavy for large hudi table.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/992236967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/992246042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4295#issuecomment-992246042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4295","id":992246042,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47JHka","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-13T09:01:03Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T09:01:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"774e98c8a46110d3d9a99ae0516bc94996eacefb\",\n    \"status\" : \"FAILURE\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4230\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"774e98c8a46110d3d9a99ae0516bc94996eacefb\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* 774e98c8a46110d3d9a99ae0516bc94996eacefb Azure: [FAILURE](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=4230) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/992246042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/992256192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2104#issuecomment-992256192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2104","id":992256192,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM47JKDA","user":{"login":"blxyct","id":91591689,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXWUCQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91591689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct","html_url":"https://github.com/blxyct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blxyct/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-13T09:12:30Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T09:12:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ashishmgofficial Hello, I have encountered the same problem.
