I think we can probably replace the number of items in a batch size (or make this secondary to the buffer size).

This continues until one of a couple scenarios is reached:  max buffer size is met or exceeded (based on the the size of each flowfile that has been collected), there are no more files coming into the processor (one or more flowfiles have been collected but we have not yet eclipsed the max buffer size).  In either case, we would close out that collected batch of files and send them on their way much as you had before.\n\nIn terms of the 250MB by default, this is from the default batch size of 250MB and, the worst case scenario, each file is 1MB in size. While each of these files is converted to a byte array for sending, they are continuously sitting on the heap.  In the event multiple instances of this processor are running, we could quickly consume some big chunks of the heap.  What I am proposing is to either get rid of the batch size (that property no longer exists) or make this a secondary consideration where we try to receive a certain batch size but first ensure we do not exceed the configured buffer and second, do not exceed the batch size, with similar semantics to the above scenarios in terms of when those batches are sent on their way plus, when a certain batch size has been reached.\n\nDoes that clarify a bit? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195367460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195383477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/218#issuecomment-195383477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/218","id":195383477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTM4MzQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-11T14:19:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T14:19:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds good, @trkurc.

I address some of the concerns you mention below, and ask some questions back to you at the end.\n\n#### Incremental Delivery\n\nI propose this PR as a viable first step on a potentially long path.  I believe this increment can be useful to pilot the concept on its own, leaving further enhancements pending feedback and expressed interest.\n\n#### Credentials File\n\nI decided not to provide a sample credentials XML file.  If included, it would most naturally fit with other configuration files in the `conf` directory.  But the default permissions on the conf directory files are not appropriate for this credentials file.  I felt that including the file at that location would lead to it simply being left there.  On the other hand, creating an entirely new folder or permission might be presumptuous for a controversial and unproven feature.\n\nAfter carefully considering these factors, I chose the lazy and cowardly way out by just documenting what the file should look like, and leaving it up to the user to find a home for it.\n\n#### User Management Tool\n\nI provide no tool in this PR for generating password hashes. I simply document it as \"bcrypt 2a, 10 rounds\".  bcrypt is a standard of sorts, and there are many libraries and some command-line utilities available for it.\n\nI am absolutely open to providing a tool, bundled in NiFi or sold separately.  I did not find similar command-line utilities shipped with NiFi, and again, it seemed presumptuous to build out a structure for that at this time.  Am I missing them?\n\nThere are also other possible hashing algorithm and tooling combinations.  We might consider SHA256 or another algorithm that might have better default installation support.  I wasn't real happy with the options OpenSSL provided, MD5 is widely derided for passwords, but bcrypt fits the bill and was conveniently included in the Spring package.  I'm open to others, and an obvious future expansion would be to permit several.\n\n#### Comparability with Other Providers\n\nI considered that NiFi provides no tool for generating certificates, does not include default keystore or truststore files, nor suggest their locations and what permissions you should or should not have on them.  This is an imperfect comparison, since this intends to be simpler, but perhaps a reasonable choice for an initial release.\n\n#### General Wisdom Of Doing This At All\n\nThis identity provider is opt-in.  As you point out, it currently requires determined configuration and admin work to get it running given that I provide neither tools nor a credentials file.\n\n#### Questions\n- What is required to make this viable?\n- Is there a better medium than bcrypt that combines widespread tool support with decent encryption.\n- Are we open to including a command-line user admin tool?\n- Are we open to including a sample credentials file?  Where would you recommend it go?\n- Are we open to documenting this identity provider on the front-page of the Admin Guide alongside X.509 and LDAP?  Where else should I do so?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195596621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195651563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/267#issuecomment-195651563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/267","id":195651563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTY1MTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-12T03:42:24Z","updated_at":"2016-03-12T03:42:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jvwing James, you've obviously put effort and thought into this and I didn't mean to deride it.

LDAP integration was just recently added, and Kerberos is obviously yet to be delivered. \n\nOff the top of my head, Bcrypt is definitely a strong candidate for the password hashing (single-iteration SHA-256 is essentially the same as plaintext), the certificate support is fairly well-documented in the [Admin Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#security-configuration), keystores are not user-editable flat files and are password-protected by default, and there are substantial third-party resources surrounding the documentation of \"securing a NiFi instance\" from various organizations. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195651563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195793923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/272#issuecomment-195793923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/272","id":195793923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTc5MzkyMw==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-12T19:18:55Z","updated_at":"2016-03-12T19:18:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Due to JIRA unavailability, I think the PR has not been linked to issue in JIRA.

The fix converts the TOOLS_JAR path into a short 8.3 path without spaces, so the eventual call to NiFi has only one quoted parameter.  The expanded TOOLS_JAR path was not working due to spaces, and two quoted paths make the whole thing blow up for reasons I do not comprehend.\n\nHowever, this was not enough to get the env feature running on Windows 10.  Running it outputs \n\n```\n17:58:32.959 [main] DEBUG o.a.n.b.NotificationServiceManager - Found 0 service elements\n17:58:32.963 [main] INFO  o.a.n.b.NotificationServiceManager - Successfully loaded the following 0 services: []\n17:58:32.965 [main] INFO  org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.RunNiFi - Registered no Notification Services for Notification Type NIFI_STARTED\n17:58:32.987 [main] INFO  org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.RunNiFi - Registered no Notification Services for Notification Type NIFI_STOPPED\n17:58:32.989 [main] INFO  org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.RunNiFi - Registered no Notification Services for Notification Type NIFI_DIED\n17:58:33.012 [main] DEBUG org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - Status File: bin\\nifi.pid\n17:58:33.013 [main] DEBUG org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - Status File: bin\\nifi.pid\n17:58:33.040 [main] DEBUG org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - Properties: {port=40930}\n17:58:33.041 [main] DEBUG org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - Pinging 40930\n17:58:33.078 [main] DEBUG org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - Sent PING command\n17:58:33.080 [main] DEBUG org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - PING response: PING\n17:58:33.081 [main] INFO  org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.Command - Apache NiFi is not running\n```\n\nWhere the last line \"Apache NiFi is not running\" matches RunNiFi.java line 559, where the env() method quits after not finding a PID.

It might be possible to work out an \"if Windows, do this to get the PID\" flow.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195858721/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/195861132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/218#issuecomment-195861132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/218","id":195861132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTg2MTEzMg==","user":{"login":"trkurc","id":3050642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTA2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc","html_url":"https://github.com/trkurc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trkurc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-13T03:06:07Z","updated_at":"2016-03-13T03:06:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I discovered the same issue with the pid on windows 10.

Any web service which _disallows_ a standard HTTP header is arguably broken.  Quoting RFC 2616:\n\n>   Any HTTP/1.1 message containing an entity-body SHOULD include a\n>   Content-Type header field defining the media type of that body.
