I would be very much interested in seeing the results of the tests that have passed in that environment were you could not get a router to come up. I assume many tests do require a router, so I wonder how did they pass. Please do ping me (us) if you have some results to share, I'll be happy to try to figure it out with you.\n\nAnd by the way, I've tried running many marvin tests in parallel and got very unpredictable issues. My guess, most test create resources (offerings, networks, etc) by name and keep using them by name. So two different tests might be using the same resources, and that introduces unexpected side effects. For a limited number of tests I was able to run required_hardware=true/false in parallel and get the same results. My next few experiments will be to reproduce this and then try to parallelise even further. I'll keep you posted, since my findings might be relevant for you too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152120849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/152120874","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/848#issuecomment-152120874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/848","id":152120874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MjEyMDg3NA==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-29T09:09:59Z","updated_at":"2015-10-29T09:09:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM,
