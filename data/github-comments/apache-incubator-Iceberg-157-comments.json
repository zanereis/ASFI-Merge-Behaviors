Could you elaborate?\r\n\r\nLet me explain why this change was made:  \r\nRecently, I found that the driver oom will occur when the compaction jobs rewriting the v2 table. After analyzing the memory of the driver heap, I found that the `RewriteFileGroup` will occupy a large amount of memory, so I thought maybe we could get rid of the reference to the group when the rewrite was done.  \r\nThe heap occupation like this:  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26177232/159434220-b0d5b6c9-9ca6-4ced-b4a4-b1bf868708af.png)\r\n\r\nWe now use `Stream` to save the `RewriteFileGroup`, which will not release the memory until all threads are completed. I'm not sure if anyone has encountered it, but the compaction job with v2 tables on my side encounters a lot of groups that need to be rewritten, resulting in a lot of memory for this class. So I modified the `Stream` to a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue,` removed the reference to the `RewriteFileGroup` after rewrited, and converted it to a simple class when storing in the result set to reduce the memory occupation.  \r\n\r\n@RussellSpitzer What do you think about this?

I think we need to really clarify the use cases and make sure we're coming up with a solution that really addresses those.

It feels like that the use case where it becomes more cost effective gets narrow pretty quickly (as compared to just versioned bucket).\r\n\r\nGiven that there are these different strategies, we might actually want to separate this behavior into an interface for `DeletionStrategy` where we can provide implementations that are targeted to the use case.

I know there were more issues and a few PRs too. Feel free to link anything that may be related.\r\n\r\nFound another PR on this:  https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2890\r\n\r\nNeed to think a bit about CRC.\r\n\r\nOn first thought, seems the original ignoreScheme/ignoreAuthority proposal can solve the problem.  But if the goal is to make RemoveOrphan safe (ex, not remove all files if we change HDFS authority like today), then both need to default true, and as Ryan says we need to decide the right values for all FileSystem we support as it may not be the case for S3.  And personal thought, the flag name may cause some confusion (it could be read as remove orphans ignores prefix checking files when removing)\r\n\r\nMaybe an alternative is to do it the other way, the user has to force the delete when scheme/authority do not match to get the old behavior (which should be rare), or choose to skip them.\r\n\r\nWe could do it by distinguishing two sets from the inner Spark job, and have it return\r\n1. If FileSystem file does not match either absolute or relative path of any reachable Iceberg file\r\n2. If FileSystem file matches relative path, but not absolute path of a reachable Iceberg file (Before, will be returned as orphans as well and be silently deleted).\r\n\r\nThen a flag \"prefixMismatchMode\", \"error\", \"delete\", \"skip\" controls what to do with the second set (default=error, throws exception)\r\n\r\nThis might be an easier UX to me and no need to choose file-system specific flags.  The user in this case specifically chooses to skip if prefix no longer matches.  But it is worse performance compared to the original proposal in this case, as we would return a lot of results to driver just to throw the exception, not sure if its worth it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1075746153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1075773308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4267#issuecomment-1075773308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4267","id":1075773308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85AHv98","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T00:13:38Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T00:13:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to merge this since there's still ongoing discussion about #4254.

I'm not sure if there's a use case for both versioned bucket and tagging for delete.\r\n\r\nYes, after doing some more research I think this is the right conclusion. I thought there was such a use case based on what @rdblue describe, but I've never heard of any.\r\n\r\nRegarding having a `DeleteStrategy`, I don't have a strong opinion for the interface either. The original proposal of introducing `s3.delete.tags` is a minimum integration, but if some other approaches are easier for your integration use case we can totally go with that.\r\n\r\nI don't know how this interface would look like though, do you have anything in your mind? Because unlike bulk operation, this is just conceptually a \"delete\" in the user's mind, which should ideally reuse the existing delete interface. So the strategy feels more like a config to me, where we can have `s3.delete.strategy=delete(default)|tagging` to choose from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1075969127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1075969650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2737#issuecomment-1075969650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2737","id":1075969650,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85AIf5y","user":{"login":"weichampion","id":38829422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODI5NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38829422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion","html_url":"https://github.com/weichampion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weichampion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T06:29:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T06:29:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jhsenjaliya hello, i'm a question :\r\nspark-sql --packages org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark3-runtime:0.13.1  --conf spark.sql.catalog.hadoop_prod=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog --conf spark.sql.catalog.hadoop_prod.type=hadoop --conf spark.sql.catalog.hadoop_prod.warehouse=hdfs://10.195.5.62:9001/_iceberg/warehouse\r\n\r\nI just run into spark-sql shell, and use merge into command : \r\nMERGE INTO hadoop_prod.default.target t USING (SELECT * FROM hadoop_prod.default.source) u ON t.id = u.id \r\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.name = u.name \r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;\r\n\r\nthen return a message like this : \r\n\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: MERGE INTO TABLE is not supported temporarily.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkStrategies$BasicOperators$.apply(SparkStrategies.scala:796)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.planning.QueryPlanner.$anonfun$plan$1(QueryPlanner.scala:63)\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you help me ? \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1075969650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1076115697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4333#issuecomment-1076115697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4333","id":1076115697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85AJDjx","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T09:01:24Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T09:01:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> If we add this to `core`, what are the implications for existing JUnit 4 based tests?

They will be optional and we will still need to resolve them somehow to compare with absolute paths we get from listing. I assume we will have the same issues without normalization and with different yet equivalent authorities/schemes.\r\n\r\n@flyrain, it is an interesting idea. However, is there an efficient way to compute these values for all files in a location? I assume it will require a request per every listed file, making this extremely expensive. We may find a way to persist these values for referenced files for future use cases but I am afraid we will need to send a request for every actual file that we get after listing a location and it is going to be costly (not to mention that listing itself is already extremely expensive).\r\n\r\n@szehon-ho, I can see you idea being implemented. If I understand correctly, it will behave like this:\r\n\r\n- Build a DF of reachable normalized paths with scheme/authority (if a file does not have either scheme or authority, inherit it from the location we clean).\r\n- Build a DF of reachable normalized paths without scheme/authority.\r\n- Build a DF of all actual files in the location with scheme/authority.\r\n- Find actual locations that don't match reachable normalized paths with scheme/authority. These are potentially orphan files.\r\n- Among potentially orphan files, find which of them match reachable files if we ignore their scheme and authority.\r\n- Act according to `prefix-mismatch-mode` that can be `error` (default), `delete`, `ignore`.\r\n\r\nI think it is worth exploring this option. It is also not perfect, though. Cases when the bucket name (authority) is different would result in an exception. Also, are there scenarios where we want to compare authorities but not schemes?\r\n\r\nWhat does everybody else think?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1076756955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1076773031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4378#issuecomment-1076773031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4378","id":1076773031,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ALkCn","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T20:09:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T20:09:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Merged, thanks @ajantha-bhat ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1076773031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1076811604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4263#issuecomment-1076811604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4263","id":1076811604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ALtdU","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T20:55:51Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T20:55:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue @emkornfield I appreciate the reviews!

If we want to further optimize we could even conditionally skip the prefix-less comparison for non-error mode, like in original algorithm.\r\n\r\nI'm open if error mode proves too cumbersome to be useful.  Initialy I was thinking its a safety, that they must turn off if trying to delete on a different absolute location than what the files were written with.  Users could go back to running RemoveOrphan with default 'error' mode once table is fixed with all locations on the new prefix.  Maybe it can be via RepairManifests with an option to rewrite the prefix, or once relative path is there we can change the root location.\r\n\r\nYea, I didn't initially think to distinguish scheme/authority, with just prefix, which is different if either are different.  When bucket is different, we should throw exception right?  (user tries to clean a different bucket than the one the table initially wrote to).  Though I can see for the other case  , if the scheme is different (s3 => s3a), it's debatable.  I was thinking to avoid too many details in the config, just have them set prefix-mismatch-mode='ignore' in this case, but we could put another flag if we really need.
