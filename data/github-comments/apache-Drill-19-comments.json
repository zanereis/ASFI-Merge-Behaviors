Is there a disagreement?\r\n\r\nPerhaps respond to each open comment saying something like \"will fix\", \"won't fix\", \"beyond scope\" or something so we know if we're ready to move ahead with this PR, or if we are waiting for a few more improvements.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/310518676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/310519034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/796#issuecomment-310519034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/796","id":310519034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDUxOTAzNA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T22:22:10Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T22:22:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this PR ready for final review?

Seems there has been no action on this PR for a while. I suspect this is due to several reasons. Let's see if we can move things along.\r\n\r\n* In general, the Drill project requires that each PR be in response to a Drill JIRA ticket. Please create a JIRA ticket for this improvement. Then, please edit the title to say \"DRILL-xxxx: description.\" See other PRs for examples.\r\n* Would be great to describe the work that's been done. The description is best in the JIRA, but can appear as a comment here. (Once the JIRA ticket is in the title, the post will automatically be transferred to JIRA as a comment.) The more information you can provide, the easier it is for reviewers to understand the code. In many cases, you can simply provide links to material that, say, describes what \"indexr\" is.\r\n* The PR has many conflicts with existing files. For example, the pom files have old versions. To fix this, perhaps rebase the work onto the latest master.\r\n* The PR changes some Drill files (Parquet, etc.) outside the scope of \"indexr\". Is this intentional? Due to working with an old version of Drill?\r\n\r\nLet's see if we can work through the issues so we can begin to review the actual code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/310521033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/310521389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/720#issuecomment-310521389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/720","id":310521389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDUyMTM4OQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T22:35:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T22:35:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is another PR, for indexr-0.3.0.

I thought Drill implicitly creates files with a single row-group anyway. \r\n\r\nMy understanding of the JIRA's problem statement was that if the Parquet block-size (i.e. the rowgroup size) is set to a large value that exceeds the HDFS block size, using the flag would allow Drill to ignore the larger value in the options and write with a parquet-blocksize that matches the target HDFS location. So, I could have {{store.parquet.block-size=1073741824}} (i.e. 1GB), but when writing an output worth 512MB, instead of 1 file... Drill would read the HDFS block-size (say 128GB) and apply that as the parquet-block-size and write 4 files. \r\n\r\n@fmethot is that what you were looking for? An **automatic scaling down** of the parquet file's size to match (and be contained within) the HDFS block size?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/311836520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/311852340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/851#issuecomment-311852340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/851","id":311852340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTg1MjM0MA==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T03:25:36Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T03:25:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/311852340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/311868313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/826#issuecomment-311868313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/826","id":311868313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTg2ODMxMw==","user":{"login":"ppadma","id":1904860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma","html_url":"https://github.com/ppadma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T05:45:35Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T05:45:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kkhatua  HDFS allows specifying block size during file creation which overrides the default file system block size.

As a result, it has never previously gone through the full unit tests and QA test suite. This commit enables the managed sort by default. Doing so has found a number of small issues, resolved below. These issues probably should have been found earlier, but having the option turned off gave a false sense of security.\r\n\r\n## Single-Batch Optimization\r\n\r\nThe code contains an optimization for short queries. If the query has just one batch then the sort need not copy that batch to produce the output. Instead, the sort simply passes along the input batch along with an SV2. This commit fixes some issues with transferring that single, buffered, input batch to the sort’s output container.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, however, `TestDrillbitResiliance` assumes that the sort does a sort/merge even with a single batch. To allow that test to work, added an option that turns off the optimization. This is really a hack just to get that one test to work and should be removed when we find time to fix the test.\r\n\r\n## Record Batch Sizer (Again)\r\n\r\nRunning the full suite of tests pointed out some additional issues with the \"sizer\":\r\n\r\n* LIST and UNION types have no standard size and instead throw an exception when queried.\r\n* LIST types (along with repeated maps) have an outer offset vector and an inner content. The sizer now accounts for both.\r\n\r\nThe code to set final variables only once was pushed to the breaking point, so gave up and used non-final members, modifying the code to make it less convoluted since the code can now set the value to a starter value, then revise it for specific types.\r\n\r\n## Memory Use for In-Memory Sort\r\n\r\nThe sort operates in several modes, one of which is an in-memory sort merge. All incoming batches are retained in memory and individually sorted. Then, an SV4 is created that effectively merges the in-memory batches into a single larger hyper (i.e. \"virtual\") batch. Works fine.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that we've not got, perhaps, many GB of data in memory. We'd like to release that memory as soon as possible. The code was revised to take advantage of the iterator protocol: once the sort returns `NONE`, it releases its in-memory batches so the memory can be reused by a downstream operator.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, the streaming agg batch requires that the sort hold onto the batches even after a return of `NONE`. This is certainly a bug stemming from Drill's process optimization to omit designs and dive straight into code: we never defined the exact iterator semantics. Changing the behavior in the streaming agg would be a big project. The agg really just needs the last row, but to get that, we have to hold onto may GB of data.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to back out the sort optimization and simply release memory on the `close()` call as before. But, since this project is intended to optimize memory use, that option was rejected. Instead. The compromise, for which I deeply apologize, is to insert a hack into the streaming agg to tell the sort to retain batches after `NONE`, then to call an explicit `release()` method when the batches are no longer needed.\r\n\r\nLonger term, this mechanism should be built into the iterator protocol. But, that too is a big project and unlikely to be a priority. So, we need to do what works for now. Sorry!\r\n\r\n## Control Over Merge-Batch Size\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned the in-memory merge/sort. The sort determines the size of the \"virtual\" batches sent downstream, the default for which is 64K. Note that such batches are a bit strange: they take no memory, even when transferred into the downstream batch, as the memory is owned by the sort. There may be a reason for smaller batches, but that has not yet become clear.\r\n\r\nWhat has become clear is that the old sort provided an obscure boot-time option, `ExecConstants.EXTERNAL_SORT_MSORT_MAX_BATCHSIZE` that one test used. The new code omitted this option.

But, it is gathered here for quick reference to speed the code review.\r\n\r\nThe PR is broken into commits by layer of function. May be easier to review each commit one-by-one rather than looking at the whole mess in one big diff.\r\n\r\n## Column Accessors\r\n\r\nA recent extension to Drill's set of test tools created a \"row set\" abstraction to allow us to create, and verify, record batches with very few lines of code. Part of this work involved creating a set of \"column accessors\" in the vector subsystem. Column readers provide a uniform API to obtain data from columns (vectors), while column writers provide a uniform writing interface.\r\n\r\nDRILL-5211 discusses a set of changes to limit value vectors to 16 MB in size (to avoid memory fragmentation due to Drill's two memory allocators.) The column accessors have proven to be so useful that they will be the basis for the new, size-aware writers used by Drill's record readers.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n\r\n* Implement fill-empties logic for vectors that do not provide it.\r\n* Use the new size-aware methods, throwing vector overflow exceptions which can now occur.\r\n* Some fiddling to handle the non-standard names of vector functions.\r\n* Modify strings to use a default type of bytes[], but offset a String version for convenience.\r\n* Add “finish batch” logic to handle values omitted at the end of a batch. (This is a bug in some existing record readers.)\r\n\r\n## Result Set Loader\r\n\r\nThe second layer of this commit is the new “result set loader.” This abstraction is an evolution of the “Mutator” class in the scan batch, when used with the existing column writers (which some readers use and others do not.)\r\n\r\nA result set loader loads a set of tuples (AKA records, rows) from any source (such as a record reader) into a set of record batches. The loader:\r\n\r\n* Divides records into batches based on a maximum row count or a maximum vector size, whichever occurs first. (Later revisions may limit overall batch size.)\r\n* Tracks the start and end of each batch.\r\n* Tracks the start and end of each row.\r\n* Provides column loaders to write each column value.\r\n* Handles overflow when a vector becomes full, but the client still must finish writing the current row.\r\n\r\nThe original Mutator class divided up responsibilities:\r\n\r\n* The Mutator handled the entire record batch\r\n* An optional VectorContainerWriter writes each record\r\n\r\nThe result set loader follows this same general pattern.\r\n\r\n* The result set loader handles the entire record batch (really, a series of batches that make up the entire result set: hence the name.)\r\n* The TupleLoader class provides per-tuple services which mostly consists of access to the column loaders.\r\n* A tuple schema defines the schema for the result set (see below.)\r\n\r\nTo hide this complexity from the client, a ResultSetLoader interface defines the public API. Then, a ResultSetLoaderImpl class implements the interface with all the gory details. Separate classes handle each column, the result set schema, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis class is pretty complex, with a state machine per batch and per column, so take your time reviewing it.\r\n\r\n## Column Loaders\r\n\r\nThe column writers are low-level classes that interface between a consumer and a value vector. To create the tuple loader we need a higher-level abstraction: the column loader. (Not that there is no equivalent for reading columns at this time: generated code does the reading in its own special way for each operator.)\r\n\r\nColumn loaders have a number of responsibilities:\r\n\r\n* Single class used for all data types. No more casting.\r\n* Transparently handle vector overflow and rollover.\r\n* Provide generic (Object-based) setters, most useful for testing.\r\n\r\nBecause this commit seeks to prove the concept; the column loader supports a subset of types. Adding the other types is simply a matter of copy & paste, and will be done once things settle down. For now, the focus is on int and Varchar types (though the generic version supports all types.)\r\n\r\nTo handle vector overflow, each “set” method:\r\n\r\n* Tries to write the value into the current vector (using a column writer)\r\n* If overflow occurs, tell the listener (the row set mutator) to create a new vector\r\n* Try the write a second time using the new vector\r\n\r\nThe set of column writers must be synchronized (not in a multi-thread sense) on the current row position. As in the row set test utilities, a WriterIndex performs this task. (In fact, this is derived from the same writer index used for the row set test code and is defined by the column accessor code.)\r\n\r\nAs with the row set version, a variety of column loader implementations exist depending on whether the underlying column is a scalar, an array, a map (not yet supported), etc. All this is transparent to the client of the tuple loader.\r\n\r\n## Vector Overflow Logic\r\n\r\nThe heart of this abstraction is that last point: the ability to detect when a vector overflows, switch in a new vector, and continue writing. Several tricks are involved.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have a row of five columns: a through e. The code writes a and b. Then, c overflows. The code can’t rewrite a and b. To handle this, the tuple loader:\r\n\r\n* Creates a new, small set of vectors called the “overflow batch”\r\n* Copies columns a and b from the current batch to the overflow batch.\r\n* Writes column c to the overflow batch.\r\n* Allows the client code to finish writing columns d and e (to the overflow batch).\r\n* Reports to the client that the batch is full.\r\n\r\nNote that the client is completely unaware that any of the above occurred: it just writes a row and asks if it can write another.\r\n\r\n## Skipping Columns\r\n\r\nThe loader must also handle a reader, such as Parquet, that skips columns if they are null. There were bugs in Drill’s vectors for this case and temporary patches were made in a number of places to make this work. The trick also should work for arrays (a null array is allowed, Drill represents it as an empty array.) But, this code also was broken. For good measure, the code now also allows skipping non-null columns if a good “empty” value is available: 0 for numbers, blank for strings. This behavior is needed for the CSV reader; if a line is missing a field, the CSV reader treats it as an empty (not null) field.\r\n\r\n## Result Set Schema\r\n\r\nThe tuple loader is designed to handle two kinds of tables: “early schema” (such as Parquet and CSV) define the schema up front. “Late schema” (such as JSON) discover the schema during reading. The tuple loader allows either form, and, in fact, uses the same mechanism. (The only caveat is that issues occur if adding a non-null column after the first row has been loaded.)\r\n\r\nConsumer of batches will, of course, want to know that the schema changed. Providing a simple flag is muddy: when should it be reset? A better solution is to provide a schema version which is incremented each time a column is added. (Columns cannot be removed or changed — at least not yet.)\r\n\r\n## Internal Vectors vs. Vector Container\r\n\r\nThe result set loader uses its own mechanism to manage vectors within the loader. Vectors are stored on each column to allow quick, indexed access and to simplify creating new columns.\r\n\r\nHowever, the consumer of the batch (eventually, a new scan batch), wants a vector container. A special class handles this translation, including incrementally modifying the container as new columns are added.\r\n\r\n## Logical Tuples\r\n\r\nAs if the above were not complex enough, we must deal with another layer of complexity. Suppose we have a query of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM myTable\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn such a query, the reader will read all columns using the tuple loader. Very simple. But, many queries are of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT a, b FROM myTable\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere “myTable” contains columns (a, b, c, d, e). There is no point in reading columns c, d and e: we’d just throw them away. Instead, we want to define a “logical tuple” that contains just (a, b) and not even read the others.\r\n\r\nEach Drill record reader does this in its own way. The tuple loader provides a new, standard solution in the form of a logical tuple loader.\r\n\r\nThe logical tuple loader works just like the regular one: but it knows which columns are projected and which are not. If the reader asks for a projected column, the logical loader returns a column loader to load the value. But, when the reader asks for a non-projected column, the logical loader simply returns null, telling the application to discard that column (or, better, to not read it at all.)\r\n\r\nThe logical loader is needed because the regular loader will create columns on the fly: the logical loader intercepts the column request and returns null instead.\r\n\r\n## Materialized Schema\r\n\r\nFor reasons that will become clear in the next PR, the scan batch ends up doing quite a bit of semantic analysis to map from the select list and the table schema to the result schema. Drill provides a BatchSchema class that is useful, but limited in this context. To solve this problem, a new class, MaterializedSchema, does what BatchSchema does, but allows fast access by both name and position, and allows the schema to grow dynamically.\r\n\r\nThe row set abstractions for testing already had a concept of a tuple schema, so this was extracted and extended to act as the foundation for the materialized schema.\r\n\r\n## Result Vector Cache\r\n\r\nAbove we mentioned that the tuple loader allows schema changes on the fly. As the next PR will make more clear, downstream operators want a fixed set of vectors. To assist with this, the tuple loader uses a “result vector cache”. Let’s say a scanner reads two JSON files with the same schema. The first crates the schema and vectors. The second is obligated to use the same vectors. This is a royal pain. But, the vector cache does it automatically: when the tuple loader adds a new column, it checks if the vector already exists in the cache and reuses it. If not there, the cache adds it and returns it so that it is there the next time around.\r\n\r\n## Map, List, Union and Other Complex Support\r\n\r\nThis commit does not yet address complex types such as maps, lists, union vectors, and so on. The idea is to get the basics to work first. The commit does, however, support arrays of primitive and Varchar types.\r\n\r\n## Row Set Test Classes\r\n\r\nThe row set test classes and the above new classes share the same column accessors. The test classes were updated to catch the new overflow exception. Because the test code is used to creates small batches as test input data, the overflow exception is translated to an unchecked exception to keep test code simple.\r\n\r\nSeveral row set index classes were moved and adjusted to use the revised form needed for the tuple loader.\r\n\r\nA few names were changed to reduce confusion (mine) over what they meant.\r\n\r\n## Unit Tests\r\n\r\nAll of the above is pretty thoroughly tested via unit tests. In fact, the unit tests are a good place to start (now I tell you!) in order to see how client code uses the various abstractions.\r\n\r\nThe bit of unit test structure that handled system options turned out to be wrong. Modified it to use the defaults defined in the system option manager, which required changing the visibility of the defaults table.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\nSome unit tests were updated to use new features which become available in this PR. See TestFillEmpties and TestVectorLimits.\r\n\r\nThe `equals()` method in BatchSchema is badly broken. Cleaned it up some. But, didn’t want to change it too much in case anything depends on the current, broken, semantics. So, added a new `isEquivalent` method to provide the correct semantics. Added an `isEquivalent()` method to the MaterializedField as well that will ignore the “implementation” columns that hang off of types such as nullables, repeated, etc. That is, two repeated columns are identical if their type is identical, regardless of whether one has the “$offsets” child or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/312786526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/312875674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/805#issuecomment-312875674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/805","id":312875674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjg3NTY3NA==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-04T13:17:46Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T13:17:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Resolved

Once the security is being configured for Drill then it's better if all the config changes are done in single place (which is drill-override.conf) and then make sure that all communications are secure.
