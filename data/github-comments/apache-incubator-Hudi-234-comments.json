If there is a business scenario requirement, we can implement it, and mention a jira.\r\n> \r\n> thanks for your reply! @XuQianJin-Stars I need to create a view based on hudi table data on a special old instant to query the old data. so I try two way to get it.\r\n> \r\n> 1. use `create view xx select * from hudi_tbl timestamp as of xxxx`, and it's not support yet we know.\r\n> 2. so i try the second way, like\r\n>    `CREATE external TABLE tbl_snapshot_v20220512164415876 using hudi options ( as.of.instant=20220513103255808 ) LOCATION 'xxxx;`\r\n>    create a table first, and create a view based on this table.\r\n>    but the `as.of.instant` is not work, it always query the latest snapshot, why?\r\n> \r\n> and now I try use inc query: `CREATE external TABLE tbl_inc_v20220512170625756 using hudi options ( hoodie.datasource.query.type='incremental', hoodie.datasource.read.begin.instanttime=0, hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime=20220512170625756 ) LOCATION 'xxx';` and the `hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime` is work! so why the `as.of.instant` can't but the ` hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime` can work?\r\n\r\nhave a try this \r\n```\r\ncreate table $tableName1 using hudi \r\ntblproperties(\r\n   primaryKey = 'id',\r\n   type = '$tableType'\r\n)\r\nAS location '${tmp.getCanonicalPath}/$tableName1' \r\nselect id, name, price, ts from $tableName1

\r\nHi~ Your question is very good !\r\n \r\n> 1. Do we really need HudiAvroParquetInputFormat; how about modify HoodieRealtimeRecordReaderUtils.avroToArrayWritable directly\r\n\r\n`org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat` which `HoodieParquetInputFormatBase`  extends or `ParquetRecordReaderWrapper` can only read parquet file types without avro logical type. So that we need to create a new `RecordReader` to transform paruqet row to avro rows, and then we can use `avro schema way` to parse these rows.\r\nThere is another way to solve this problem: Create a new serde class to read paruqet-avro files. But that way is more expensive and requires changing hive-site.xml. At the same time, we may not be able to modify hive schema.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/99555c897acf9bdd576e7ab233dc448d537e7aea/hudi-sync/hudi-hive-sync/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hive/HiveSyncTool.java#L273-L278\r\nI have submitted a PR to hive to solve the problem of reading timestamp type, but maybe I don't know how hive community handles issue, and that PR has been closed. https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/871 \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HIVE/issues/HIVE-22224 \r\nI also submitted relevant PR to the drill community to solve the problem of reading timestamp. https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2431\r\nAfter I found this problem and after several different attempts, I found that the current method should be a simple and easy way to understand processing at present (it may not be the purest method, because in the hive codes, many methods are final, so that we can not extends them).\r\n\r\n> 2. Do we support time zone？\r\n\r\nThere is a [TimestampTZ class](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-3.1/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/common/type/TimestampTZ.java) in Hive. However, in the past tests, I found that it seems that even if it is not explicitly declared as the time zone type, the timestamp will display the results according to the current time zone in the query results of hive (I will do another test tomorrow to verify it).\r\nIn fact, when it is converted to long, it will only be expressed as UTC time. In some specific cases, we can use hive's function to make our own transformation.\r\nIf the time zone is a meaningful type, I think we can supplement it with spark and flink together later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1128892203/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1128937953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5595#issuecomment-1128937953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5595","id":1128937953,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5DSjnh","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T14:24:31Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T14:24:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

then delete data use spark-sql\r\n\r\nI go through the code , and I found flink will check key length, if equal to 1,  then use simple key generator, but spark always use complexKeyGenerator whether the lenght is equal to 1 or not.  so the root cause is simple key won't add field name prefix when generate record_key.\r\nso I think Hudi-flink maybe need to add logic to check keygen in the table instead of checking by itself
