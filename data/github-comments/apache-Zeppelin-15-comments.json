The main challenge with the jdbc generalization at the moment is the lack to dynamically inject particularly jdbc jar dependencies.  On the other hand artificial problems like generalizing the JDBC URL syntax seems useless and even harmful for me.

for by late reply, having a default Docker image for Zeppelin is a great idea, couple of things though:\n- I think that `MAINTAINER` field should either be something like Zeppelin Project (incubating), or in case you are willing to volunteer to take care of it and leave as it is, may be this should be discussed on dev@ mailing list first, to let others know and get a consensus \n- it might be a good idea to expose \"~/.m2\" repository in Dockerfile as `VOLUME` and advise users in comment at the top of the file to mount it before building an image (as you do in Makefile)\n- generally it's a good practice to have a comment, at the top of the file, with explanation of what it is for, how to build it and how to use it\n  \n  ``` sh\n  # Build: \n  #   `make install-local` default\n  #    `....` spark 1.5, hadoop 2.2\n  # Usage:\n  #   docker run .... \\\n  #       ....  <path-to>/bin/zeppelin.sh\n  #\n  #   NOTE: you may want to use /root/.m2 volume to save time
