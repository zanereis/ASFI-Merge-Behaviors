the most complicated cases. The request and the command is made for CREATE_CLIENT which is not maker-checker, but ACTIVATE_CLIENT, which runs hidden as a side-action, is maker-checker. So when you try to approve the maker CREATE_CLIENT command request, it should be successful, even if the main action is not 'maker'.\r\nFor your request I've added now one more test case, which is more simpler: WITHDRAWAL_SAVINGSACCOUNT. It is a real maker-checker transaction level action, on Savings Account main entity.\r\nIf 4 eye is working for both of these cases then I do not think that any more tests are required, because the concept is the same for all other entities/actions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1874821768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1874870457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3592#issuecomment-1874870457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3592","id":1874870457,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85vwEC5","user":{"login":"IOhacker","id":46640258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjQwMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46640258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker","html_url":"https://github.com/IOhacker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IOhacker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-03T05:32:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T05:32:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello Marta,\r\n\r\nThis change targets Transactions executed on Savings Accounts?

@GoyalRocks007 , I'm not really convinced this change is needed. I see your path has a whitespace in it and that's causing the problem. I'm afraid there are other problems lying around that'll be triggered as soon as you try to use whitespace in paths.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest please put your project into a path without whitespaces.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1903536369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1903548447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3686#issuecomment-1903548447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3686","id":1903548447,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85xddgf","user":{"login":"galovics","id":4701389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDEzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4701389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics","html_url":"https://github.com/galovics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-22T09:09:50Z","updated_at":"2024-01-22T09:09:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HarimbolaSantatra please rebase your PR to the latest develop, it's gonna fix the build issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1903548447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1903985280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3687#issuecomment-1903985280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3687","id":1903985280,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85xfIKA","user":{"login":"GoyalRocks007","id":147911928,"node_id":"U_kgDOCND0-A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147911928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007","html_url":"https://github.com/GoyalRocks007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoyalRocks007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-22T13:15:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-22T13:15:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @galovics , I understand.

@galovics ,\r\n\r\nRegarding Point No. 2 above, It was kept in that format to be able to run a highly concurrent user requests all working across different account numbers at a time (Say 1000 concurrent requests with each request working on different account number at a time). The use CSV config file helps achieving the unique account numbers to be used across different threads.  This can be simplified to just create and use account numbers from within the JMeter suite for a relatively lower concurrent user requests.\r\n\r\nPoint 3.  The transactions can be performed repetitively. In its current format it expects to clear the data and re-run. By simplifying the format of usage in Point 2, this behavior will change.\r\n\r\nPoint 4. By default both read and write points to same IP and it works against the single instance Fineract without Read/Write seperation. I have added the provision to be able to work with a Read/Write seperated setup, in which case, user can specify a different IP for those two instances.\r\n\r\nWith further simplified version, we can change behavior to overcome the observations you mentioned in 2 and 3 above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1942118755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1943725725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3630#issuecomment-1943725725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3630","id":1943725725,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85z2uad","user":{"login":"adamsaghy","id":7602740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDI3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7602740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy","html_url":"https://github.com/adamsaghy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-14T13:01:41Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T13:01:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hero78 Please rebase and squash your commits!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1943725725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
