I've noticed that makes some endpoint names like `{GET}/users/{id}`. It seems a bit odd like it indicates the `{GET}` is a dynamic property. I was thinking of maybe just changing it to `[GET]` so it would be `[GET]/users/{id}`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I noticed you have an issue about parsing URLs at (https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/329). Maybe you have in mind another solution? Like ignoring the endpoint name whenever the span's `Tags.URL` and `Tags.HTTP.METHOD` are set and just doing that combination on the backend? If it was done that way there would be automatic support for any plugin which has REST endpoints,
