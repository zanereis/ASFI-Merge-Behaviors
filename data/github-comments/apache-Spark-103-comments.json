This patch only makes it work for the yarn-client mode, I would like to see it work in both if we are changing it.  Would you be able to look into yarn-cluster mode also? \n\nThe thing that I noticed while looking at this that I do consider a bug (but not what you reported in this pr) is that if I specify --name with spark-submit script with yarn-client mode it doesn't properly set the name on the RM or in spark. the yarn-cluster mode does work fine though. I will file a separate jira for that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41703171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41703467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/539#issuecomment-41703467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/539","id":41703467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzAzNDY3","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-29T17:06:20Z","updated_at":"2014-04-29T17:06:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought I looked at yarn-cluster mode and it was doing the right thing, but I'll look again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41703467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41703565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/589#issuecomment-41703565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/589","id":41703565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzAzNTY1","user":{"login":"techaddict","id":1378755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1378755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict","html_url":"https://github.com/techaddict","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-29T17:07:11Z","updated_at":"2014-04-29T17:07:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srowen scala error is related to #550 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41703565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41703827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/586#issuecomment-41703827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/586","id":41703827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzAzODI3","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-29T17:09:28Z","updated_at":"2014-04-29T17:09:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pwendell  perhaps I'm missing something, the line you point to is for java options not for spark configs.
