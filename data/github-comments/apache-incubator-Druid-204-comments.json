My PR was originally intended to resolve a different issue related to an inability of parquet-avro conversion to handle `INT96` columns, but I think the addition of `flattenSpec` that both the `parquet` and `parquet-avro` parsers of my PR support, may solve some or all of the problem this PR is trying to solve.\r\n\r\nThat said, if there are some gaps in the `flattenSpec` based approach of my PR and the functionality introduced here, I believe our changes could be made to co-exist in some manner, we would just need to distinguish between my `parquet-avro` parse spec with it's `flattenSpec`, and this PR's with it's `parser`.

But current `PeriodDropRule` is a impractical rule for it will always drop recent data. Then if people want to `retain 30 days` data, they can not use such `PeriodDropRule` but have to do like: load 30 days, drop forever. And because people have used the `drop forever` rule which would drop segments in the future, then below things occured:\r\n> 2. The user loads some data from slightly in the future (maybe some clocks are running a bit fast or slow) using streaming ingestion. This creates a segment with an interval that is in the future.\r\n> 3. The coordinator disables the segment immediately upon noticing it (since it is not within the last 30 days).\r\n> 4. The Kafka tasks time out during handoff (because the segments are never loaded).\r\n> 5. And after that timeout, the data that was slightly in the future is still not available!\r\n\r\nThen I think there are two ways to solve these things:\r\n1. Period load rules include the future by default\r\n2. Add a new drop rule or modify current `PeriodDropRule` to support `drop before a period`, then if people want to `retain 30 days` data, they can do like this: drop 30 days before, load forever.\r\n\r\nI prefer the second way and want to modify current `PeriodDropRule` not add a new one because the current one is very impractical, IMO no people would like to use such drop rule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/425671460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/425673982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6335#issuecomment-425673982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6335","id":425673982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTY3Mzk4Mg==","user":{"login":"shivtools","id":12538052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM4MDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12538052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools","html_url":"https://github.com/shivtools","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivtools/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-29T20:38:18Z","updated_at":"2018-09-29T20:38:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm No issues, it was good fun working on this!

For `PeriodLoadRule`, I think we didn't consider future data at that time. For `PeriodDropRule`, I have no idea.\r\n\r\n> I prefer the second way and want to modify current PeriodDropRule not add a new one because the current one is very impractical, IMO no people would like to use such drop rule.\r\n\r\nI would say it's better to add a new rule because it's much easier. Modifying an existing rule in an incompatible way would take a long time, because we need to discuss about it and check its use cases as many as possible. Please note that modifying `PeriodLoadRule` to include future data is compatible with the current behavior. If `PeriodDropRule` is really not useful, we can deprecate and remove it in the future.\r\n\r\nBut, I know there is a production use case that `PeriodDropRule` _might_ be useful. They are ingesting data from a single Kafka stream into two different Druid dataSources. One stores the recent data of, let's say last month while another stores old data. In such cases, they can use `PeriodDropRule` for the old dataSource to drop last month data to avoid the potential duplicate data issue.\r\n\r\nSo, I would say adding new rules is more welcomed and having the current `PeriodDropRule` would be fine if there's no real problem.

basically I want to check how large performance benefit the new parallel merge algorithm can give us. Even though you mentioned that it shows about 85% of performance improvement in some internal tests, it shows the overall performance benefit not the algorithm itself. Of course, the overall performance is more important, but the later one is also important because it gives us an insight about what we can expect exactly with this feature, I think.\r\n\r\nAlso the query performance is affected by many factors like dataSource size, query filter selectivity, # of aggregators and their types, cluster size, and so on. JMH would be useful because we can easily replicate the performance benchmark with the same query and the same data which makes us easy to maintain or improve it in the future.\r\n\r\nI think the JMH should include the below:\r\n\r\n- Simplifying historical part to check the performance of only the broker merge algorithm. For example, there's no HTTP communication between CachingClusteredClient and actual query runners of historicals. Also, the query runners of historicals can just do aggregation for a single segment (or even return just some pre-aggregated values).\r\n- Benchmarking with varying `intermediateMergeBatchThreshold` and # of streams to be merged.\r\n- Maybe need testing against different query types (timeseries, topN, groupBy).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/427451367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/427458571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6326#issuecomment-427458571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6326","id":427458571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzQ1ODU3MQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-05T18:29:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T18:29:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dclim thanks!
