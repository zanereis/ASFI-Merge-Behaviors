As I mentioned in my comments, you can't assume you know anything about the identifier. TinkerPop has no knowledge of what it contains.  It could be that a `Graph` implementation uses numbers that exceed the size of `Long` which would generate an error in your current code.\r\n\r\n> The sort algorithm I suggested is indeed a heuristic, still a better heuristic as the default String sort by Java \r\n\r\nWhat you have may be better for identifiers that have pure numerics, but imo, it makes sorts of strings mixed with numbers less intuitive that the default. I think that if you want your change for numbers then you need to make them both make sense. \r\n\r\n> let's go the other way and make debug/normalization easier accessible by command line. I suggest adding the debug option even in the TinkerPop Docu GraphML initial mentioning (I suggest to add this option for other formats as JSON as well).\r\n\r\nYour link in the above didn't work, but I think I know what you are referring to. I guess I don't have a problem with calling more attention to the normalization option, but I can't say that I fully follow why normalization should be so important to anyone. \r\n\r\nThe only use case that I am aware of is if you were doing file comparisons/diffs on generated files - normalization would help you there, especially if you were pushing such files into source control or something similar. But, to me, that's not a common use case. I would venture to say that most people just want to \"save their data\" and don't really care about looking at it in any way. \r\n\r\nDo you have some other use case that makes this feature so important? You mentioned \"analysis of regression tests\" but I would like to hear more about that. We tend to be careful about features that don't suit wide use cases.\r\n\r\n>  Sorry for the import reordering,\r\n\r\nNo problem - happens all the time with all different IDEs\r\n\r\nA final point, depending on the complexity of how this sorting algorithm ends up, I think that it might be important for us to see what the performance differences are between your changes and what we had before. That's nothing that we need to have immediately as the PR is still changing, but I just wanted to let you know that it may be necessary to fully evaluate this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/406019497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/406090298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/889#issuecomment-406090298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/889","id":406090298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjA5MDI5OA==","user":{"login":"mattallenuk","id":4797711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTc3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4797711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk","html_url":"https://github.com/mattallenuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattallenuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-18T22:10:32Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T22:28:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can run the tests outside of Maven with a local secure gremlin server and the tests run fine.

I'm trying to understand the SASL authentication process looking at how the Java code handles it (https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/tp33/gremlin-driver/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/driver/Handler.java#L88-L110). In my code, I haven't pushed it yet, I am receiving from the server the 407 authorisation required request and I am sending an initial message containing { saslMechanism: \"PLAIN\" } but the response I get back is authentication failed. Is there something that I'm missing? Am I right in that I should be sending that message then wait for the initial response and send the sasl authentication message? I know that currently only PLAIN mechanism is accepted and I can send that without declaring what mechanism I'm sending, but I'm trying to make the code future-proof for when other authentication drivers and sasl mechanisms are supported.

I've modified the Sasl Authenticator so that a mechanism can now be passed in along with any mechanism options. I've changed the Sasl Plain Authenticator to mimic the Java handler code as discussed, however I had to do some fudging as I couldn't get the flow to work right. \r\n\r\nFrom my understanding of the Java code the Driver/Handler/GremlinSaslAuthenticationHandler class receives a 407 from the Gremlin Server and then sends a message containing { saslMechanism: 'PLAIN', sasl: (A base64 encoded null byte string) }, the server then returns an initial response and the client then sends the actual sasl authentication message... I tried that and I was getting a message that \"Authentication ID must not be null\". Having looked at the Gremlin Server code and the Handler/SaslAuthenticationHandler class and the Auth/SimpleAuthentication class it doesn't appear that saslMechanism token is actually parsed and the the server expects the actual sasl message right away. So, currently, in the JS SaslAuthenticator class I've passed the full Sasl message with the initial SaslMechanism argument. \r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense and if it needs changing I'm happy to do so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/408684427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/408703195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/898#issuecomment-408703195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/898","id":408703195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODcwMzE5NQ==","user":{"login":"daem0ndev","id":2738707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzg3MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2738707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev","html_url":"https://github.com/daem0ndev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daem0ndev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-29T20:20:53Z","updated_at":"2018-07-29T20:20:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm working on a NestJS module for gremlin client that will essentially be a clean typescript wrapper over this gremlin-javascript library.

If the regression tests rely on some sort order in xml, they're doing it wrong.  If it's the graph being validated, then the test should pull it into a graph engine and validate using graph queries.  If the xml is being validated, then the test should use xml tools, e.g. xmldiff, schema validation, etc.  If the test really requires sort order, which it shouldn't because GraphML does not guarantee any order, then it should transform the xml with xslt before validating it.\r\n\r\nThat said, the writer already provides an optional, **deterministic** order feature.   If someone doesn't like that order, then someone else won't like this order.

I guess we can close this PR once we get that branch merged to tp33 and master. \r\n\r\n@danielcweber thanks again for sticking to this PR and taking it to the end. it is appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/412556440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/412557171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/903#issuecomment-412557171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/903","id":412557171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjU1NzE3MQ==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T15:23:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T15:23:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm back from OOO, I'll look at it this week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/412557171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/412566430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/842#issuecomment-412566430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/842","id":412566430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjU2NjQzMA==","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T15:51:03Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T15:51:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm looking into this.
