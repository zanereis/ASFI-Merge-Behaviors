The reason why is that we have a Sink that does some internal work and then passes the result to a Source where it gets written to a channel and then is sent along downstream. To do this the Sink needs to locate the Source instance, which it can't do from a start() method since it doesn't have access to the configuration.  To accommodate this I am adding an Initializable interface with a single void initialize(MaterializedConfiguration configuration) method. So in your case you could extend the HDFSEventSink and have it implement the Initialize interface and get the information from the KafkaChannel you want.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1068807611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1068814651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/346#issuecomment-1068814651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/346","id":1068814651,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACGL7s4_tNE7","user":{"login":"wanghangyu817","id":18672877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcyODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18672877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghangyu817","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-16T07:24:36Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T07:24:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"My current approach is to customize hdFssink and get the values in Kafkachannel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1068814651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1068826739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/346#issuecomment-1068826739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/346","id":1068826739,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACGL7s4_tQBz","user":{"login":"rgoers","id":120415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers","html_url":"https://github.com/rgoers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rgoers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-16T07:43:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T07:43:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Correct.

No, you should not change it now. But this is exactly what I would like to change for 2.0. Flume does this is many places and it is too brittle. I would like to adopt a plugin system similar to what Log4j 2 does that allows new components like these to be added dynamically without having to update an enum file. i.e. - PrometheusHttpMetricsServer would be annotated to indicate it is a Plugin of type Metrics server with a name of PROMETHEUS (or the mixed case equivalent) so the loadMonitoring method in Application would be able to find it and start it without requiring an enum.

For people who want a lightweight deployment, should we offer different profiles, the flipside being that if you're combining two components from different modules (e.g. syslog and kafka, HTTP and HDFS etc) then actually do you ever get the benefit of the modularity, or does it just ramp up your complexity (complexity = adoption blocker in my mind).\r\n\r\n> Unless I am mistaken, it is getting the distribution tar and using the configuration located within that. I fail to see how useful that will be as I would expect most users would have a custom configuration.\r\n\r\nIt does bundle the default conf directory, but it is anticipated that a user would re-map that or pass config in via environment variables (which could then include secrets). Both designed to work in docker and kubernetes. There's an example of doing that here: https://github.com/apache/flume/blob/d2bd7812dbacd86459726c0fd3dc774272ce0222/flume-ng-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/flume/test/util/DockerInstall.java#L137-L153\r\n\r\n> I think starting from \"everything goes in the bucket\" to match our historic deployment shape is fine.

No. But for example, in @busbey 's world where he might be moving from a previously managed deployment to something that needs additional orchestration, using Docker or Kubernetes and deploying agents across many nodes, this could make things much easier to manage and maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1300061047/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1309781742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/logging-flume/pull/390#issuecomment-1309781742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/390","id":1309781742,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACGL7s5OEa7u","user":{"login":"vvishnuk","id":117886921,"node_id":"U_kgDOBwbPyQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117886921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk","html_url":"https://github.com/vvishnuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvishnuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T05:06:33Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T05:23:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"could someone merge this PR as this is fix for CVE-2022-42889\r\n\r\n@tmgstevens , Could you please help in merging this","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/comments/1309781742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
