So the options are:\r\n* rewrite the storage driver base code to take advantage of `requests` native support for chunking via yield generators or passing a file stream object. http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#streaming-uploads \r\n* use a \"raw\" httplib connection and use the old code.

It would need to support metadata, though, but that should not be too hard, either with xattr or a hidden folder containing JSON or pickle files with the metadata.\r\n\r\nI also see that libcloud tests support plugging our own secrets, in theory this would allow to run real end-to-ends tests without mocks, right? That would be too slow for normal usage, but would allow to catch more issues.
