If this is correct, then as soon as 2 tasks run concurrently on the same machine we should run into this problem.\n\nOn [this line](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManagerMasterActor.scala#L329) in the `BlockManagerMasterActor`, there is a check on the `BlockManagerId`, which will always be different per `Executor` instance, because the port in there is randomly assigned. The `executorId` however is always set to the mesos `slaveId`. This means that we are running into [this case](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManagerMasterActor.scala#L331-L335) as soon as we start two `Executor` instances on the same slave. This PR fixes this by adding the counter to the `executorId`.
