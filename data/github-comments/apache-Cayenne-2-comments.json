However then the Postgres Docker container would be started and stopped for each submodule, even for those that don't have any integration tests and don't need a running database. This would slow down the build by 2-5 seconds per module. As the two submodules run tests against a database I choosed that approach. But feel free to change.\n\nPS: The pull request is result of discussion here: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/206a60fb8697c2bc1b7c9c44f62f9eb6a7500bb9a6b57b3bd70ebaac@%3Cbuilds.apache.org%3E\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/246783052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/247109825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/111#issuecomment-247109825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/111","id":247109825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzEwOTgyNQ==","user":{"login":"andrus","id":42668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus","html_url":"https://github.com/andrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T18:27:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T18:27:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, good point.
