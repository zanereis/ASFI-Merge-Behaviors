I understand new \ntemplates may be needed for new situations.  In the cited case, there is \nnot a deducible template to create as the second line appears broken — \nnot completely interpolated and clicking (or CMD+clicking on Mac) \ndoesn’t cause any visible action.  Tools > Templates does not seem to \ninclude any options that suggest the template to create/modify.\n\nI generally write small programs so I use the templates across all \nprojects not new templates for each project.  My understanding is that \nthe existing templates are across all projects.\n\nIf a template can be established for this generated main from clicking \nthe second line of the inserted URLs, pre-populated with the default \ncontent including the URL, and after editing the edited template is used \nfor future use both inside the current and future projects, I think this \nwould be a win.\n\n\nCertainly one new-java-mainclass seems like a good way to go for command \nline programs and I was thinking that way went I made the initial post \nbut Javafx (and others) has their own structure (imports, a shell main \ncalling start and a shell launch) and that is helpful.  So reuse when \nappropriate would be great but it most important to have a path to \nhaving a template.\n\n\n>>> I also learned that the VSCode nb plugin does not have a template \n>>> manager window, so it heavily relies on those links.\n>>\n>> I'm curious how you edit those the second time! wink\n>\n> customer support probably ;)\n\nI have not used this before.  Firing it up with the extension \n“Language Server for Java by Apache NetBeans\nv14.0.301” on my Mac, and then running the only wizard there for a \nmaven Java project with the same template and two URLs that can be run \nwithin VSCode.  The same URLs are present, and the first one works \noption-clicking on it while the second one is unresponsive.\n\nDave","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1274172514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1274212485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3902#issuecomment-1274212485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3902","id":1274212485,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5L8vCF","user":{"login":"lbownik","id":13538832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTM4ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13538832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik","html_url":"https://github.com/lbownik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbownik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-11T07:27:46Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T07:27:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm leaving for a week.

your quote was incomplete. PSR-12 says\r\n> All PHP files MUST end with a non-blank line, terminated with a single LF.\r\n\r\nSo there must **not** be a blank line at the end of the file, but the last line has to be terminated with a LF.\r\n\r\nIn fact this is a linux convention followed by common text editors. In Linux the LF character is not regarded as a line seperator, but as a line **terminator**, where valid lines should end with LF. You can read more about that distinction on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Interpretation).\r\n\r\nIf you create an empty file on Linux in Netbeans, insert some characters (without pressing return key) and save, it won't add the line terminator LF. But this should be done on linux text files (see [here][1] or [there][2]).\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour leads to issues when you are using tools like `cat`. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n    # create an empty file in netbeans and enter \"test\" without pressing the return key. Then on the terminal do the following:\r\n    \r\n    naitsirch@linux1:~$ cat file_created_by_netbeans.txt\r\n    testnaitsirch@linux1:~$\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this could be changed for all text file types if the `Unix(LF)` formatting is used.\r\n\r\n## Also important\r\n\r\nIf a text file with `Unix(LF)` formatting is opened, where the last line is terminated with an LF (`some text<LF><EOF>`), Netbeans should not show it with an extra empty line. Currently this happens because the LF is interpreted as a line seperator instead of a line terminator.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://superuser.com/a/745135/248359\r\n[2]: https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/11630","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1275854128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1275981688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4776#issuecomment-1275981688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4776","id":1275981688,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5MDe94","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-12T11:03:13Z","updated_at":"2022-10-12T11:03:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've thought about this myself too - happy to help / look at this.
