Hi. I had met the same trouble. The cause is that because I compiled rocketmq with JDK11, but running rocketmq in JDK8.\r\n> In JDK11(in fact since JDK9) ByteBuffer.flip() returns a ByteBuffer. BUT It used to return a Buffer in JDK8.\r\n> You can look at the link [plasma-umass/doppio#497](https://github.com/plasma-umass/doppio/issues/497) to get more info.\r\n> Hope can help you.\r\n\r\nIt`s ok ，thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/690969237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/691000178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2297#issuecomment-691000178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2297","id":691000178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTAwMDE3OA==","user":{"login":"Jaskey","id":5210351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTAzNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey","html_url":"https://github.com/Jaskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jaskey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-11T10:05:09Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T10:05:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"先说结论：如果仅仅是broker与nameserver的连接断了，实际上不影响客户端的使用。 \r\n\r\n1. 客户端会通过nameserver 的感知能力发现broker下线，很快就不会再向这个broker发送消息了（客户端摘除该broker地址）。\r\n2. 在摘除之前的确可能还会继续发送这个broker，但是按照题设只是broker网络和nameserver断了，实际上不影响。\r\n\r\n从你的日志上看，实际上不仅仅是断连的问题，看起来是网络或者是服务有问题：\r\n```\r\norg.apache.rocketmq.remoting.exception.RemotingTimeoutException: wait response on the channel <rocketmq-namesrv-prod01.cloud.bz/xx.xx.xx.xx:9876> timeout, 6000(ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\n所以本身需求来说是符合需求的，只是现在不是断连接的问题，更像是一个节点故障的问题。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/691000178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/691009893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2297#issuecomment-691009893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2297","id":691009893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MTAwOTg5Mw==","user":{"login":"tank1314","id":20177514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc3NTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20177514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314","html_url":"https://github.com/tank1314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tank1314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-11T10:14:51Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T10:30:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Jaskey 1、 出现问题的时候，该broker节点网络出口流量出现了网络陡增的情况（内网集群平时网络流量200M左右，出问题时，流量陡增至600M左右），同时该时刻点，该节点的CPU也增加到25%左右；\r\n             2、该异常总共就出现过1次，再后续的探测轮询时间点，都恢复了正常。观察该时间点的GC日志，没检测出什么异常来。\r\n\r\n- [ ] 2020-09-10 16:42:05 INFO BrokerControllerScheduledThread1 -

Maybe we need to discuss it later.\r\n\r\n4)  If a large mount of delay messages fall into lots of commitlog files randomly,  the speed of delivering delay messages will be slow because of random reading. From our internal tests, the speed is about 200-300 tps on normal disk(15K Rounds Per Minute). Shall we need to limit produce rate?\r\n\r\nLet's work together to build open source community better.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/692056616/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/692437034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2298#issuecomment-692437034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2298","id":692437034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjQzNzAzNA==","user":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T03:15:01Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T03:15:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"how

The approach is obvious and vivid, here are some suggestions(maybe I don't have a thorough graspt of code):\r\n> \r\n> 1. Besides DelayMsgCheckPoint file is persisted on master node, the checkpoint should also be synchronized to slave node periodly; otherewise, if master node crashes down and fails to restart, slave node does not know the timestamp the message can be delivered from;\r\n> 2. In method putKey() of file DelayMsgIndexFile.java, if the method is used in multi threads, we will need to lock before operating the index file; otherwise, we might not need to release the file lock since we never use it;\r\n> 3. For the message delivered, we'd better keep its physical commitlog offset to a log let's call it deliveryLog,\r\n>    if master node restarts, we need to find out all the the undelivered messages between deliveryLog and index file, it can try to reduce the number of duplicated messages on the server side.\r\n>    Whether or not to sync the deliveryLog to slave node? Maybe we need to discuss it later.\r\n> 4. If a large mount of delay messages fall into lots of commitlog files randomly,  the speed of delivering delay messages will be slow because of random reading. From our internal tests, the speed is about 200-300 tps on normal disk(15K Rounds Per Minute). Shall we need to limit produce rate?\r\n> \r\n> Let's work together to build open source community better.\r\n\r\n1. Good suggestion\r\n2. putKey() is used by reputService, which is single thread. yeah, we can remove the release code block.\r\n3. Good suggestion. Depending on the current implementation, the user identifies duplicate messages themselves.\r\n4. It may not work to limit produce rate, because the delayMsgs delivery is up to its startDeliverTime. We can use more memory to make performance better. There may be other better solutions.\r\n\r\nLet's work together to build open source community better.

I found another problem needed to discuss:\r\n> if timewheel deliveries the delay messages a little later than excepted, assuming now is 9:00 but the timewheel is deleverying the message at 8:30, meanwhile, the system begins to remove the commitlog, the message between 8:30 and 9:00 in the commitlog(going to be removed soon) might be lost forever.\r\n> \r\n> Sometimes it is useless to deliver the delay message much later than excepted, maybe we need to rebalance how late the message we can remove directly.\r\n\r\nWe can separate the commitlog of delayMsg from the normal messages commitlog
