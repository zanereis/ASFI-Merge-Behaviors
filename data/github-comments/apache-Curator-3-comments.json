On both cases there is an ephemeral node that is not being handled by any thread but it is linked to one of the existing sessions. This ephemeral node blocks the election process. The proposed solution of cleaning up old ephemeral nodes linked to the session after a reconnection could solved both problems (at least in my opinion).</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604690529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604699021","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/574#issuecomment-2604699021","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/574","id":2604699021,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ2OTkwMjE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-18T09:30:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:12:05Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

ConnectionStateManager appears to be the only thing that can see the churn that ZooKeeper is doing.

Given that it's just a work-around for a ZooKeeper issue in the first place.  Perhaps it is not work doing?</p>\n\n<p>Jordan, any thoughts on how ConnectionStateManager could communicate with ConnectionState such that ConnectionState can choose to kill the Zookeeper instance?

Perhaps I have a weird use case, but what I'm essentially doing is running an election on a fixed schedule (say every 1 hour). When its work is finished, the leader signals for shutdown and then exits.
