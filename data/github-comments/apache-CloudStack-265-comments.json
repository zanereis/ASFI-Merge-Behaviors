Looking at the recent merges around ip address allocation, I've notified @yvsubhash on #1762. ~~I'll explore if I can find a solution otherwise I would request @yvsubhash for a proper fix and revert the changes in the meanwhile.~~ @yvsubhash I've created another regression fix that loops through a list of free public ip, lock them before marking them as allocated, this seems to have fixed the issue and won't require an explicit locking object. I've left other notes/comments on your PR.\r\n\r\nAll tests pass on manual re-run after fixing duplicate public ip issue with cpvm/ssvm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/353505349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/353548309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2368#issuecomment-353548309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2368","id":353548309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzU0ODMwOQ==","user":{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T08:27:43Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T08:27:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blueorangutan package","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/353548309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/353548455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2368#issuecomment-353548455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2368","id":353548455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzU0ODQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T08:28:32Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T08:28:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@borisstoyanov a Jenkins job has been kicked to build packages.
