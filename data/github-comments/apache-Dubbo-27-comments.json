构建hash环的缓存使用interface+method作为key，泛化调用通过getMethodName()获得方法名始终为\"$invoke\"，相当于混用了hash环。\r\n\r\n2. 使用argumentIndex针对指定参数的下标进行hash结点计算，但是由于泛化场景下，invocation.getArguments()得到的不是真实的参数，因此会导致计算错误，不是预期的hash结果。\r\n\r\n3. identityHashCode通过invoker的hashcode方法直接得到。但是invoker对象计算时会将url内容计算进去，url包含调用时间戳，每次都变，hash环每次都会失效重建。\r\n\r\n4. 虚拟节点hash环持有invoker对象引用，个人认为loadbalance作为一个策略tool，尽量不需持有对整个工作流具有重要意义的invoker。\r\n\r\n已经提交了pull

(parking)状态，此时继续增加并发，tps会下降，并且响应时间会增长，线程处理机制不太合理，正常的机制应当是将waiting的线程释放来处理更多的请求。\r\n为了验证是否为Dubbo框架的问题，我们使用了淘宝的专门针对Dubbo的压测工具，并且搭建简单的Dubbo服务进行压测，压测结果和Dubbo官网基本一致，并且work线程数仍然固定在10个左右，将consumer端connector数调整为20(原始值为1)，tps会有部分增长，work线程数也会有适当增长，但是和connector增长数不是线性增长。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/354940769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/354970168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/146#issuecomment-354970168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/146","id":354970168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDk3MDE2OA==","user":{"login":"xiegengcai","id":1704581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQ1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1704581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai","html_url":"https://github.com/xiegengcai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiegengcai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-03T09:38:03Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T09:38:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@teemoer
