why you used two machines for the static analysis? May be one is enough with two scripts for cpp and python:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - os: linux\r\n    stage: linting\r\n    dist: bionic\r\n    compiler: gcc\r\n    name: \"Ubuntu 18.04 (Static Analysis)\"\r\n    script:\r\n      - bash -ex tool/linting/cpp.sh\r\n      - bash -ex tool/linting/py.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe static analysis machine can be used also for RAT test, similar to [Apache HAWQ](https://github.com/apache/hawq/blob/master/.travis.yml#L83) and [Apache servicecomb](https://github.com/apache/servicecomb-java-chassis/blob/master/scripts/travis.sh#L34), may be something like:\r\n```\r\n\r\n  script:\r\n      - bash -ex tool/linting/cpp.sh\r\n      - bash -ex tool/linting/py.sh\r\n      - bash -ex tool/rat.sh\r\n\r\n```\r\nand create [rat.sh](https://github.com/moazreyad/incubator-singa/blob/SINGA-508/tool/rat.sh).\r\n\r\nThis automatic check of licence headers with RAT will make the release process faster. Because now we have to do it manually before the release. See [this PR](https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/620).\r\n \r\np.s. Your commits in this pull request do not have the JIRA ticket number.
