TCP probes shouldn't be surfaced by `recv()` so it shouldn't reset the idle timer. If this can be confirmed (via a small test), then I think its probably OK to just add the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option regardless of whether the idle monitor is supported.\r\n> \r\n> That being said, I'm still a bit skeptical about the real-world usefulness of this PR given that Netty can't control things like keepalive period and so on as those require OS-level options to be set. This just ends up using OS defaults which users may or may not find useful. So while I still support merging this PR, I think it will ultimately be replaced by the idle monitor.\r\n> \r\n> Again, it would great if you could confirm that setting this option doesn't affect the idle monitor, in which case, you can just always have this option on.\r\n\r\nRegarding the scenario of using `SO_KEEPALIVE` and `IdleTimeoutHandler` together, I have conducted a small test. The results show that `SO_KEEPALIVE` does not interfere with `IdleTimeoutHandler` resetting the idle timer. I also studied the source code of IdleTimeoutHandler and related TCP KEEPALIVE documentation. Based on my understanding, as you mentioned, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` feature is a mechanism of the underlying operating system's TCP, and the application layer Netty does not perceive it, so it does not affect IdleTimeoutHandler. My test steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In the gremlin-server.yaml configuration file, set `settings.keepAliveInterval` to 60 seconds.\r\n2. Create a client that connects to the gremlin-server using a long-lived connection, without actively releasing the connection, to simulate an idle connection scenario.\r\n3. Observe the time intervals of the `WRITER_IDLE` event logs printed by the gremlin-server. The entire observation period was 8 hours. The results show that the `WRITER_IDLE` event was printed 60 * 8 = 480 times, with a print interval of 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nIn short, `SO_KEEPALIVE` does not affect IdleTimeoutHandler.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2518918920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2518971038","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2915#issuecomment-2518971038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2915","id":2518971038,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc6WJHKe","user":{"login":"kenhuuu","id":106191785,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlRbqQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106191785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/kenhuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenhuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-05T02:47:17Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T02:47:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for confirming.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could add an entry to the CHANGELOG.

https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-server/conf\r\n\r\nI've gone ahead and added gremlin-lang without any special configuration in all of the yaml files. It's arguably redundant as gremlin-lang is configured by default in the server `Settings` class in this branch (in place of groovy), however it may be more clear for users to have it explicitly listed in the yaml files.\r\n\r\nI left the groovy configuration in all of the yaml files as it's still needed setup `g` and load data.\r\n\r\n> i think there's a lot more documentation changes required as well - is this more of a partial switch in preparation for more work?\r\n\r\nMy goal with this PR is not necessarily about getting rid of groovy as much as it is about making gremlin-lang more prominent. The main driver here is that with the removal of bytecode, the GLVs are generating and sending gremlin-lang scripts. The scripts should be mostly mutually compatible with lang and groovy, however there are potential incompatibilities there and it should not be recommended to execute GraphTraversal generated scripts as groovy.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely some outstanding future work related to this such as dropping the dependence on groovy to initialize the server This PR captures what I view as the critical piece for the first milestone release which is to prevent users from inadvertently running GraphTraversal generated scripts as groovy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2579090328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/2581028962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2964#issuecomment-2581028962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2964","id":2581028962,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc6Z12Bi","user":{"login":"xiazcy","id":55853655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODUzNjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55853655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy","html_url":"https://github.com/xiazcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T18:49:52Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T18:49:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE
