And do you have an idea if it fails in a data buffer or instruction buffer, or micro-op buffer allocation?\r\n\r\n@tmoreau89  I think the maximum buffer size that the CMA library can allocate on the DE10Nano board is 16MB for now. This is what I can get on the board.\r\n```\r\nroot@de10-nano:~# cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i cma\r\nCmaTotal:          16384 kB\r\nCmaFree:           15972 kB\r\n```\r\nIn addition, when I run end-to-end test with resnet-18, the `CmaFree` variable dropped quickly until it's trying to allocate `0x240000` bytes of contiguous memory and reported an error in memory allocation.\r\n\r\nThe debug message shows that it is a kind of `DataBuffer` that requires such amount of memory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529836230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529837886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2161#issuecomment-529837886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2161","id":529837886,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTgzNzg4Ng==","user":{"login":"wujiaqi6630","id":26640713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQwNzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26640713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630","html_url":"https://github.com/wujiaqi6630","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujiaqi6630/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T08:47:26Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T08:47:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank

The problem indeed stems from introducing constraints from multiple functions at once.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have the following two functions and simultaneously add them to the module:\r\n```\r\ndef @f1[a](x) -> list[a] {\r\n  Cons(x, Nil)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @main() {\r\n  f1(S(Z()))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`x` in the first one has no type annotation so `f1` will be introduced into the module with type `fun[a](?t1) -> l(a)` ([here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2648/files#diff-d25dae80d06c671132c543c097e695beR874)) where `?t1` is an incomplete type. When the inference procedure reaches `main`, the call to `f1` will treat `f1`'s type as `fun[a](?t1) -> l(a)` and `?t1` will be unified with the type of `S(Z())`, which is `nat`. But when the procedure checks `f1`, the type of `Cons(x, Nil)` will be unified with the annotated return type `list[a]`, so `?t1` will be unified with `a`. That is how we end up trying to unify `a` and `nat`. When adding functions one at a time, we resolve between each function and so never end up in this situation.\r\n\r\nI think my mistake is not making the initial types general enough [here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2648/files#diff-d25dae80d06c671132c543c097e695beR874). I think the let polymorphism changes should make it easier to give these a more general type and have things work out. I will experiment with a few possible ways of getting around the issue noted here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/530771779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/530896063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3930#issuecomment-530896063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3930","id":530896063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDg5NjA2Mw==","user":{"login":"soiferj","id":3534847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzQ4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3534847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj","html_url":"https://github.com/soiferj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soiferj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T16:08:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T16:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was testing out a BERT model which was exported with `(add_shapes=True)`, but then ran the GraphTransform `FoldConstants`.

My idea was to introduce function types as having the most general possible checked type (e.g., suppose a function's annotated type is `fun[a](?t1, ?t2) -> List[a]`. We will generalize the function's type as `fun[a, b, c](b, c) -> List[a]`, filling in the incomplete types with new variables) and then specialize it later, but I think our unification is not powerful enough to accommodate this (or I went about it badly).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/531047055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/531049861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3947#issuecomment-531049861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3947","id":531049861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTA0OTg2MQ==","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T23:57:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T23:57:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please
