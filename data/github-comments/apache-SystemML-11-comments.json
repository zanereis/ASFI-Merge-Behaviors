Second, the interface of the overloaded sliceOperations w/ PartitionedBlock needs cleanup (return type T, both block and pBlock as inputs). I would actually be in favor of removing the second slide altogether (and keep the functionality in PartitionedBlock). Third, please also use T for CacheBlock paramters to these functions to avoid unnecessary modifications of MatrixBlock/FrameBlock. Fourth, the methods for getNewInstance are odd as they need to be called on an existing instance (if they are kept, also change the return type to T). Can't we create a simple method UtilFunctions that does the same via java reflection? \n\n2) CacheableData extensions: Please change members/APIs from BroadcastObject(CacheBlock) to BroadcastObject(T) to make it type-safe.\n\n3) FrameObject: Replace the change in FrameObject.readBlobFromHDFS with current head (you need to rebase to the latest code).\n\n4) Codestyle: First, remove unnecessary casts, e.g., after getBlock (e.g., ParameterizedBuiltinSPInstruction). The same applies to any casts like (T[]) (e.g., PartitionedBlock) - this is usually an indicator of a bad API design. Second, please generally try to use short but meaningful variable names - something like 'bDoNotUpdateZeroData' is just unnecessarily convoluted.\n\n5) Input/OutputInfos: see 5 above (e.g., FrameReaderFactory/FrameWriterFactory/InputInfo/OutputInfo/MapReduceTool). \n\n6) MR Compatibility: Remove the import of scala.Tuple2. You need to be careful not to introduce Spark dependencies into the core block runtime otherwise this would break on MR clusters without Spark libs.\n\n7) Testsuite: First, the R input file handling seems incorrect (name + \"Csv\") - either use a proper file extension or the same name. Second, remove the BinaryBlockFrame input/output infos from ALL tests (FrameConverterTest/FrameMatrixCasting, see 5). Third, remove commented code from your testclasses - this is more confusing than it helps anybody.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/227054028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/227221740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/180#issuecomment-227221740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/180","id":227221740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzIyMTc0MA==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T18:07:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T18:07:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @gweidner.

I would  recommend to simply modify the MatrixReaderFactory and select the sequential readers if DEFAULT_SPARSEBLOCK is not MCSR. Yes, it might be too pessimistic if the data is dense, but we anyway use MCSR to overcome CSR performance issues on incremental construction (e.g., read of textcell with unordered input cells). \n\n2) LibMatrixDNN: This is not related to the PR at hand, but I would also call the sequential version for numThreads=1 because there is no point in creating the threadpool for single-threaded execution. Furthermore, right now any exceptions within those  tasks get discarded - please get the set of futures from invokeall and explicitly call get (which will propagate any occurred exceptions). @niketanpansare \n\n3) LibMatrixDatagen/LibMatrixMult: Please fold the thread-safe condition into the main fallback to sequential execution in order to simplify potential code paths.\n\n4) Matrix Block: We need to make this isThreadSafe method robust against non-allocated sparse blocks (sparseBlock==null).\n\n5) Tests: It would be actually a great idea to use CSR as default sparse block type and run our entire testsuite to reveal any open issues. We've never done that so far. Anyway, if we find anything, we don't need to delay this PR but can solve it separately.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/230670560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/230672884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/184#issuecomment-230672884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/184","id":230672884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDY3Mjg4NA==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T05:14:05Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T05:14:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"great - thanks @nishi-t this looks already pretty good.

Since jekyll uses the raw md files to generate a static html documentation site, we need to keep the extensions as html.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/233387372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/233389920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/193#issuecomment-233389920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/193","id":233389920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzM4OTkyMA==","user":{"login":"ahmaurya","id":720110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDExMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/720110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmaurya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmaurya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T16:57:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T16:57:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Since Jekyll generates HTML files, it should be its job to link them properly as well, perhaps using a plugin as advised here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25826770/jekyll-using-links-to-internal-markdown-files Anyway, this issue is not important to consume your time and mine.

Usually, it's a good idea to instrument the core block multiply and run it with gc:verbose to exclude buffer pool times and runs were garbage collection interfered with the timing.\n\n2) well, right now we're still in a stage were we first need to really understand the basic characteristics. Personally, I would be interested in a couple of things: How close to peak PCIe transfer speeds to we get? How close to peak GPU memory bandwidth do we get with a sparse/dense matrix-vector multiply. Where is the break even point between compute/memory bandwidth for common operations like XtX and XY (with increasing number of columns for Y). \n\n3) The methods values(r), indexes(r) return the full arrays in order to avoid copy - together with pos(r) this allowed us to implement all sparse operations efficiently against CSR and MCSR at the same time. However, making it more explicitly is fine; I would recommend to follow the same pattern and call them values() and indexes().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/235115327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/236060876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/198#issuecomment-236060876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/198","id":236060876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjA2MDg3Ng==","user":{"login":"nakul02","id":5394361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTQzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5394361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02","html_url":"https://github.com/nakul02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T00:07:10Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T00:07:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Submitted [Jenkins](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-OnDemand/191/) build.

Even in embedded DSL approach, there are two possible implementation choices:\n   a. Execute code with a context (as in this PR). \n   Pros: Simple and elegant push-down mechanism and no redundant computation.\n   Cons: Difficult to implement mixed code.\n   **b. Add lazy data structures which will be executed only when certain actions are invoked on them.**  Ideally, we will want the user to be able to mix in NumPy and other Python code seamlessly.  Option (a) is still a decent approach.\n3. Push-down of language-level constructs:\n   **a. No modification to Python implementation, but slightly inelegant usage through use of functions (as in this PR). See parfor invocation in the below code.**  We definitely do _not_ want to ask the user to create a custom Python build.  We should simply support PySpark with Python 2 or 3.\n   b. Modify Python parser to support pushdown. This requires users to rebuilt oru version of python from scratch.\n4. Whether to add standalone support as it requires reimplementing Py4J bridge of PySpark.  **No, using PySpark on a laptop is already extremely simple.**\n5. APIs of the built-in functions: Should it be similar to PyDML ? **I would vote for it to be equivalent to NumPy.**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/236063404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/236282791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/197#issuecomment-236282791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/197","id":236282791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjI4Mjc5MQ==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T20:17:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T20:28:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @dusenberrymw for your thoughts :+1: \n\nHere are my comments:\n\n> > **Add lazy data structures which will be executed only when certain actions are invoked on them. Option (a) is still a decent approach.**\n\nMy only worry with Option (2.b) is that adding lazy data structure would make Python API complex and hence make the embedded script difficult to debug. We can start by getting feedback about Option (2.a) from data scientists and go to Option (2.b) only if absolutely necessary.\n\n> > **Push-down of language-level constructs**\n\nI agree with you about Option (3a). Also, cleaned up the API for language-level constructs (and updated the example in my first comment). So Option (3.b) is not required.\n\n> > **Ideally, we will want the user to be able to mix in NumPy and other Python code seamlessly.** \n\nThere are two options here:\n\nA. We ask users to isolate the mixed code themselves:\n\n``` python\nwith context(sqlCtx):\n    m1 = random.uniform(rows=3, cols=2)\n    m2 = random.normal(rows=2, cols=3)\n    m3 = dot(m1, m2)\n    registerOutput([m3])\n\n# mixed code:\nnumpyM3 = m3.getNumPyArray()\nnumpyM4 = do certain numpy operations\nm4 = Matrix(numpyM4)\n\nwith context(sqlCtx):\n    some DML that uses m4\n```\n\nThe above option requires writing appropriate input/output wrappers to convert binary blocked RDD into NumPy arrays and viceversa.\n\nB. We do callbacks to Python using external builtin functions. Here the user will have to wrap up mixed code into Python UDF and then we provide some construct to push it down as external UDF. The external UDF will do necessary conversions and call Python UDF using Py4J framework.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/236282791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/236319208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/200#issuecomment-236319208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/200","id":236319208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjMxOTIwOA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T23:33:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T23:33:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Imran.

Handling previous versions of Spark can be discussed separately (e.g., dev list) since some Spark changes are not backward compatible.
