A few suggestions for improvement:\r\n\r\n1. Please separate pure reorderings (alphabetization) with no believe semantic change in a separate commit from adding new ones.\r\n\r\n2. Please keep plugin versions in a separate section from dependency versions, as in the current scheme.\r\n\r\n3. Please ensure things like comments are preserved if you're moving code around -- e.g., the comment about keeping maven versions in sync seems to have been lost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/303455676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/303456538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3043#issuecomment-303456538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3043","id":303456538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzQ1NjUzOA==","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-23T16:26:37Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T16:26:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @cph6!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/303456538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/303457160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3158#issuecomment-303457160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3158","id":303457160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzQ1NzE2MA==","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-23T16:28:15Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T16:28:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@seshadri-cr website is hosted at https://github.com/apache/beam-site.
