In each `during callback`, calculate the transition prop or polygon pionts final by that `el.shape.abc`. That is so called \"functional interpolation\".\r\n+ Text animation in custom series.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n\r\nFor users, in each frame, users usually need to:\r\n+ read the current props value from the current graphic element.\r\n+ calculate based on those values.\r\n+ write the result to the that graphic element.  \r\n\r\nFor echarts, we need to:\r\n+ restrict the \"power\" of that new API for forward compatibiliy (think of the potential changes or other related features in future).\r\n+ think of the reasonability of the API.\r\n+ think of implementation complexity and performance of the API.\r\n\r\nThe current API is implemented in the follow way:\r\n```js\r\nrenderItem(params, api) {\r\n    var abcVal = makeNextAbcValue(params, api);\r\n    return {\r\n        type: 'polygon',\r\n        shape: {\r\n            abc: abcVal,\r\n            points: calculatePolygonPoints(abcVal)\r\n            // Make the built-in interpolate to be adapted on \"abc\".\r\n            $transition: 'abc'\r\n        },\r\n        during: function (apiDuring) {\r\n            var abcVal = apiDuring.getShape('abc');\r\n            var points = calculatePolygonPoints(abcVal);\r\n            apiDuring.setShape('points', points);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it provides those \"method\" to for users to read and write the values in the \"during callback\":\r\n```js\r\ninterface DuringAPI {\r\n\r\n    // currently only transform props  \r\n    // (x, y, scaleX, scaleY, originX, orignY, rotation) \r\n    // are available here. Other attributes are not supported \r\n    // until really needed one day.\r\n    setAttr(key: TransformProps, val: unknown): void;\r\n    getAttr(key: TransformProps): unknown;\r\n\r\n    // get and set and any props in \"shape\".\r\n    // No need to make a travel since it does not support \r\n    // to input a dictionary object.\r\n    // We do not restrict the shape props types because it \r\n    // should be able to customized by users and the result\r\n    // of  `renderItem` also does not restrict the shape props.\r\n    setShape(key: string, val: unknown): void;\r\n    getShape(key: string): unknown;\r\n\r\n    // get and set and any props in \"style\".\r\n    // No need to make a travel since it does not support \r\n    // to input a dictionary object.\r\n    // We do not restrict the style props types because it \r\n    // The result of  `renderItem` also does not restrict the  \r\n    // style props.\r\n    setStyle(key: string, val: unknown): void;\r\n    getStyle(key: string): unknown;\r\n\r\n    // If `setStyle` called, echarts will auto call `durty()` \r\n    // internally for this element.\r\n    // Otherwise of only `setAttr` or `setShape` called, \r\n    // echarts will only call `markRedraw()` internally \r\n    // for this element.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Now could we think of that:\r\n\r\n1. Is it appropriate to implement those features via exposing a \"during callback\" to users?\r\n2. Is it appropriate to implement \"read & write\" in the way of the `DuringAPI` above?\r\n3. Is there any potential flaw I missed or any other better
