But do that worth about adding security features in ES connection. \r\n* `elastic plan deprecat high-api client in the future`. This is important, where can we confirm that information? and which library does the ElasticSearch recommend officially?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/360355430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/360401851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/769#issuecomment-360401851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/769","id":360401851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDQwMTg1MQ==","user":{"login":"ascrutae","id":12436447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae","html_url":"https://github.com/ascrutae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T08:56:01Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T08:56:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can you give me a demo for reproduce this issue?

And from this notice, I didn't see any reason about performance, and the version 7.0 to be deprecating, 8.0 removed, that maybe one year later.
