Currently, this implementation is using the moving averages for normalizing the current batch.  We should update this to simply maintain moving averages for use during test time, but perform the normalization with the current batch mean & variance.  Check out \\[1].\r\n2. The gradient check tests were passing in the initialized moving averages to both `forward` and `backward`, and due to (1), this is causing issues.  This will be fine with updates to (1).\r\n3. In general, we should split this out into a `batch_norm` layer, and a `spatial_batch_norm` layer.  Since we don't have tensors, we can't infer the shapes of the inputs if they are indeed tensors flattened into matrices, and thus we rely on the user to pass in any extra shape information for such cases.  Batch norm could be applied to 3d image data (i.e. (N, C*H*W)) , but also to just 2d data (i.e. (N, D)).  Since we would rely on the user to supply `C`, `H`, and `W` for the first case, and those wouldn't apply to the second case, we need to split this into two layers.  Additionally, the `spatial_batch_norm` would be used for per-channel batch norm, and the `batch_norm` would be used for all other cases.\r\n4. The backward pass will still need some updates, but those will be cleaner once the above split is done.\r\n\r\n\\[1]: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/nn/modules/batchnorm.py#L104","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/287483524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/287484162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/390#issuecomment-287484162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/390","id":287484162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzQ4NDE2Mg==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T22:12:16Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T22:12:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, I just saw you added an `inference` function.

The only change that is bought about is the way `-config` is specified.\r\nPreviously, to specify a config file, you'd say `-config=SystemML-config.xml`. This PR changes it to \r\n`-config SystemML-config.xml`. (Note the `=` instead of the ` `).\r\n\r\nScripts & tests have been updated to reflect this. \r\nIf any of you have existing scripts on your machines that specify the old `-config=` format, please change it after the PR is merged in.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, now that Apache Commons CLI is used, the arguments can be specified in any order. The dml file need not be the first and the `nvargs`/`args` need not be the last. \r\n\r\n@deroneriksson, @asurve & @dusenberrymw - Could you please review this?\r\n\r\n## What's wrong with the current options passing mechanism?\r\nI also think that we should standardize how we pass in CLI options to SystemML. Right now we have the [`Ant`](https://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html) way of passing arguments, i.e. `-<option> <value1> <value2>` or some weird variation of it.\r\n`-f` is a short option name, there is not corresponding long option name. Something like `--file`\r\n`-config=` is a weird way of accepting arguments, when all the other options have a space as a character to separate the option and the value.\r\n\r\nTypically with GNU like long options, you'd have a single dash and a single character short option and a double-dash and a longer option. This would be nice to have. \r\nWe can discuss this here.

Thus it treats `-foo` as `-f` followed by `oo`. \r\nI am not really sure what the solution is to this problem.\r\n\r\n ### For scenario 2\r\nI checked on mac and linux. The behavior in this scenario is the same when the `bin/systemml` script is used.\r\n\r\n#### temp1.dml\r\n```r\r\nprint($1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### On Master Branch\r\n```bash\r\n➜  incubator-systemml git:(master) ✗ bin/systemml temp1.dml -args \"hi hiii\"\r\n...\r\nhi\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### On this branch\r\n```bash\r\n➜  incubator-systemml git:(SYSTEMML-1103_use_commons_cli) ✗ bin/systemml temp1.dml -args \"hi hiii\"\r\n...\r\nhi\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run it using the java command, specifying all the arguments manually, it seems to work for me, both for CP mode and Spark:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n➜  incubator-systemml git:(SYSTEMML-1103_use_commons_cli) ✗ java -classpath \"conf/*:target/lib/*:target/systemml-1.0.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar\" org.apache.sysml.api.DMLScript -f temp1.dml -args \"hi hiii\"\r\nlog4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell).\r\nlog4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.\r\nhi hiii\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n➜  incubator-systemml git:(SYSTEMML-1103_use_commons_cli) ✗ $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --master local target/SystemML.jar -f temp1.dml -args \"hi hiii\"\r\nlog4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell).\r\nlog4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.\r\nlog4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.\r\nhi hiii\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error might happen because of the use of ours spark or standalone scripts. \r\nCould you please check again and let me know if you still get the error? \r\nPlease use the latest version of this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### For scenario 3\r\n\r\nI do agree with this example:\r\n```\r\n~/spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit SystemML.jar -args \"hi hii\" -stats -blah temp1.dml\r\nInvalid argument specified for -stats option, must be a valid integer\r\n```\r\nThe error message could have been better. \r\nI do have an explanation, not a solution to this however. Here it is in case you are interested:\r\nWhen `-stats` is parsed, the parser expects 0 or 1 arguments. The parser then comes across `-blah`. Now it can't find `-blah` or any prefix substring of `blah` to be a valid option, therefore it assumes it to be an option to `-stats` and stores it as a string. Later this option is tried to be parsed as an integer, when that fails, this error message is printed out.\r\nThere is a more obvious bug that I fixed. It is mandatory to specify either of `-clean`, `-help`, `-f` or `-s`. If none of those are specified, an error should be printed. I accidentally called `isRequired` instead of `setRequired`. Anyways, that is fixed now.\r\n\r\nThis is what gets printed out:\r\n```\r\nMissing required option: [-help shows usage message, -s specified script string to execute directly, -f specifies dml/pydml file to execute; path can be local/hdfs/gpfs (prefixed with appropriate URI), -clean cleans up all SystemML working directories (FS, DFS); all other flags are ignored in this mode. \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Regarding  `-args` accepting `a=b` as a single argument and not spitting out an error. \r\nIn my opinion, which to be clear is just MY opinion, `a=b` is a valid string. If a user wants to get this in, we should in no way design the system to disallow it. However, if other stakeholders of the project feel that this is not needed, I'll change it now or we can change it later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/288633147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/288633266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/435#issuecomment-288633266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/435","id":288633266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODYzMzI2Ng==","user":{"login":"nakul02","id":5394361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTQzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5394361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02","html_url":"https://github.com/nakul02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T06:58:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T06:58:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've since changed the usage string to be more concise, here it is:\r\n\r\n```usage: systemml\r\n -args <argN>           specifies positional parameters;

that these new layers give a preview of the new API that I would like to do in [SYSTEMML-1389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-1389), in which the `backward` API is updated to accept (1) all relevant gradients from upstream, (2) *all* outputs from `forward` (including any \"cached\" variables for performance), and (3) *all* inputs given to `forward`.  This provides two benefits: first, many layers can benefit from a performance perspective from having access to the outputs of the `forward` function within the `backward` function, and second, this makes the API much simpler and less error prone by allowing for simple copy-and-paste of forward inputs and outputs as arguments to `backward` and by removing ambiguity related to the parameters.  A downside is that often times, not every single parameter is needed by `backward`.  If we had an object oriented design, most of the parameters to `forward` and `backward` would just be instance variables and thus would be accessible by `forward` or `backward` as needed.  Given that we don't have that design, this API update mimics that by allowing `backward` to have access to any inputs available to `forward`, as well as any outputs produced by `forward`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/290249763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/290260882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/440#issuecomment-290260882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/440","id":290260882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDI2MDg4Mg==","user":{"login":"nakul02","id":5394361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTQzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5394361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02","html_url":"https://github.com/nakul02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-29T23:52:22Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T23:52:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
