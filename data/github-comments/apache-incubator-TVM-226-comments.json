This is an extension of a work we started exploring earlier this [year](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vegaluis/pdf/ieeemicro20_vega_lastlayer.pdf). The main difference between the paper and this RFC is the fact that we are allowing the hardware engineer to specify the level of detail of the simulating object. For example, if you have hardware code for simulating complex protocols i.e., AXI, then you could implement such protocol transactions using the proposed device interface. On the other hand, if you don't have such models or you want to bypass them to speed simulation then you can use hierarchical-paths to access memories or registers in your design, and control it the same way I am doing it in the current demo. The benefit of this *freedom* is that the interoperability should be independent of a particular hardware protocol or interface, and such interoperability should happen in the most productive way possible.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the other questions,\r\n\r\na) I haven't explored the TIR path yet. However, the benefit of doing such thing is leveraging other utilities available in the framework i.e., AutoTVM. In other words, BYOC could be considered a more shallow integration, but still useful.\r\n\r\nb) The reason why we have the `hw-widgets` repo is that this stuff is hard to explain without a running example given that we are in a hardware-software boundary. I am working on a blogpost that will come after this gets merged that not only covers all of this but also shows how to offload operators from ML models. For example, we have already tested offloading `nn.bias_add()` to the same *scalar adder*, used in this example, from a quantized MobileNet model. As @liangfu said, this is a starting point for others.\r\n\r\nFinally, this approach does not stop at ML accelerators only, you can imagine integrating a bare-metal processor out there in a similar fashion.

Hopefully we can get this in. Meanwhile, we should let more people review this PR especially it introduces a new 3rdparty dependency (`hw-widgets`). I also agree with @giuseros that it would be good to have an RFC talking about what you expect users to make use of this feature, because I didn't get this point after reviewing the PR.\r\n> \r\n> My confusion is what role \"hw-widgets\" plays in this feature.\r\n> \r\n> 1. According to its README, \"These are examples of hardware designs for testing Verilator backend integration to TVM\", is it just examples? If so then I don't think we really need an example to be in a 3rd party dependency. We should even bring the implementation into the TVM code base and only compile it when Verilator is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe `hw-widgets` repository is just an example on how to use this \"backend\" and a hardware codebase. The reason behind having a separate repo with examples is similar to the split that happen with VTA (3rdparty `vta-hw`).\r\n\r\n> 2. What should I do if I have a new design in Verilator? Should I 1) compile my design to a library like you did for hw-widgets, 2) modify the `verilator_codegen` and `verilator_runtime` to link that library? If this is a case, then this PR is more like just an example instead of a framework.\r\n\r\nI don't think I referred to this as a framework. I think this should be viewed more as another backend for TVM. Similarly to Ethos-N or DNNL, you need to have a precompiled library in your system but in this case this library is a cycle-accurate-version of your hardware as @giuseros pointed out. However, we need a separate ecosystem because like other external codegens, Verilator requires certain things to make it work.\r\n\r\nFor example, building floating-point hardware is far more complicated than integer or fixed-point hardware. Most of the backends in TVM, uses kernel libraries based on floating-point because hardware support is already free. But if you are building things from scratch, or if you are in a power-constraint environment i.e., edge, you are most likely to start with integer ops. Therefore, we need a mechanism to not only leverage full-blown-complex-accelerators but also the tiny-smallest-version-of-hardware that allow us to have a more vibrant *hardware ecosystem/community* compared to other frameworks. The other benefit of this is being capable of building hardware \"incrementally\" and evaluate your design-decisions with TVM over time.\r\n\r\n> 3. The current implementation in this PR executes the graph op by op, but it seems not common for an accelerator. Is this just an example or your intention?\r\n\r\nThis backend can mirror what we currently have for DNNL in terms of single and merged operators (composite), no reason for stopping here. The reason why we have a single one is because we have only one example for this particular operator. Eventually, we are hoping for the community to join this effort and add examples that run more complicated use cases i.e., CONV2D, etc.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> cc @zhiics @tqchen\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/733884979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/733894434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6971#issuecomment-733894434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6971","id":733894434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzg5NDQzNA==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-25T18:59:45Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T18:59:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@comaniac thank you for the feedback.

This separation can also make sure the extensibility of feature improvements in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/734720123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/734736486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6981#issuecomment-734736486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6981","id":734736486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDczNjQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-27T09:26:00Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T09:26:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"yeah.
