As far as I can tell, the TabletGroupWatcher in the Master defers to the configured master.tablet.balancer to get assignments for each Tablet.\r\n\r\nDoesn't the `DefaultLoadBalancer`, which is what I am using for testing, take into account last location when getting assignments? `TabletGroupWatcher` appears to call the get assignments function inside `DefaultLoadBalancer`. I could be mistaken too but that is where the idea spawned from and based off my testing that is what it appears to be doing.

These ops are called in the FateServiceHandler for all tables. So, I think we need a way to branch between the two validation functions that account for no-limit-names and limited-names. \r\n\r\nHere is a possible non-time-based  solution, although it is admittedly naive and has a pitfall. What about appending the Accumulo version number that the table was created under to the table name? We could set the user limit to 1024 characters, but have the internal limit to 1027 where the last three chars identify the Accumulo version (e.g. ...tablename1.9). In this way, the validation function could discern between an older table that breaks the new limit and a new table that is compliant by checking the final 3 chars.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear pitfall here, though. There might be older tables that happen to have '1.9' as their last three characters. \r\n\r\nI don't think using the ServerUtil class to detect upgrades will help because, once folks upgrade to the new version with the new limit, there still won't be a way to delineate between tables created pre-upgrade and those created post-upgrade.\r\n\r\nI will keep looking for identifying info, maybe from ZK or Master, that we can leverage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/585773777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/585788639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1430#issuecomment-585788639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1430","id":585788639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTc4ODYzOQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-13T14:41:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T14:41:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Regarding how to discern between the older tables and new ones with the length limit:\r\n\r\nThe primary action for this issue is to simply impose the limit for new table names.
