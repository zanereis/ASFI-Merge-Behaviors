There are definitely a lot of gaps that need to be filled. In fact I think the parser can't handle recursive local functions either right now.\r\n\r\nI think this is a problem with the parser, not with the module interface. In my opinion, it would be better to solve this issue by adding a dict from GlobalVar to Optional[Function] in the parser, which would serve as an in-progress version of the module. In visitDefn, we'd add the GlobalVar to the dict (mapped to None) before visiting the function and then updating the function value in the dict. Finally in visitProg we could turn this dict into a Relay Module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450437689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450438090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2352#issuecomment-450438090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2352","id":450438090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDQzODA5MA==","user":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-28T22:37:10Z","updated_at":"2018-12-28T22:37:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Additionally, although this wasn't introduced by this PR, I'm confused why we're using `name_hint` for equality in `module.cc` even though users are warned in multiple places not to use it for that purpose.

Let me expand a little bit. Let's use a simple program as example:\r\n````\r\n def @id(%x: int32) -> int32 {\r\n            let %v1 = @id(%x);\r\n            let %v2 = @id(%x);\r\n            %v2\r\n }\r\n````\r\nThe 2 occurrences of `@id` inside function body corresponds to different `GlobalVar` objects. So if we use object identity as key to look up `GlobalVar`, either one of the function call will fail during `InferType` on calling `ModuleNode::Lookup`.

For example if user manually construct a relay AST then call `InferType`, it will also get fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450445836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450450191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2352#issuecomment-450450191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2352","id":450450191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDQ1MDE5MQ==","user":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-29T01:00:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-29T01:00:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Right I think I understand the issue, but it has already been resolved for local variables in the parser. Since local and global vars have the same equality mechanism, I think the solutions should be the same. Right now, as you've mentioned, the parser always generates a new GlobalVar when it encounters one; however, this is not how it handles Vars. For local variables, the parser keeps track of scopes and looks up local variables as needed. My proposal is to do something similar for global variables. Ideally we would be able to just use the module to look up global vars, but since the module is write-once, we need to use the strategy I suggested earlier.\r\n\r\nTo further clarify,\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet %id = fn (%x: int32) -> int32 { %x };\r\nlet %f = fn () { %id(1) };\r\n()\r\n```\r\nparses fine, because `id` is in scope and has been resolved using `self.var_scopes`, but\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef @id(%x: int32) -> int32 { %x }\r\ndef @f() { @id(1) }\r\n```\r\ndoesn't parse, since `id` is created fresh and there is currently no mechanism for looking up global vars. My solution is simply to add a lookup mechanism to parser similar to that for local vars, but that also constructs the Module.\r\n\r\nAs for the second point about fixing it in `module.cc`, the equality issue is the same as for Vars, which we already expect users to deal with. It's worth revisiting equality, but IMO if we decide to use `name_hint` equality for GlobalVars, it should be changed in the class definition in `expr.h`, not in `module.cc`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450450191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450462111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2352#issuecomment-450462111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2352","id":450462111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDQ2MjExMQ==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-29T03:32:53Z","updated_at":"2018-12-29T03:32:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshpoll Thanks, Just took a look at the local variable implementation :-). `var_scope` enqueues/dequeues as the lexical scope enters/exit through let binding. And lookup uses string name of local var for looking up.\r\n\r\nI think I'm getting your point. Are you suggesting that add a scope similar to `var_scope` that maps string to `GlobalVar` objects, and always lookup first in this place?:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/3516cbe0049c7e11ee58afbc668acddb1f110ece/python/tvm/relay/_parser.py#L143\r\n\r\nSo that `@id` maps to the same object universally instead of one object per occurrence(similar to local variable)? I think it would be better to just show you the code, will work on it soon.

This allows for automatically getting both Forward and Reverse mode AD. Of course one would not \"explicitely\" store the whole Jacobian, but just construct the linear operator. E.g. for matmul:\r\n\r\n```\r\nz = matmul(x, y)\r\njacobian_dz_dx = implicit_kron(y, identity)\r\njacobian_dz_dy = implicit_kron(identity, transpose(x))\r\n```\r\nHere `implicit_kron` should not represent an actual operator that constructs the kronecker product, but rather defining an object that can compute efficiently the linear operator actions. \r\n\r\n> First-order AD can be easily optimized and does not require any further language features beyond gradients for operators. Higher-order AD in the manner of demyst would require us to add OCaml-style references to Relay, which we plan to submit soon as a PR.\r\n\r\n@MarisaKirisame could you clarify this point? It seems very counterintuitive that somehow first order derivatives are \"more special\" then any other order. Technically differentiation should be something applicable to any graph, regardless if it comes from differentiation or not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450528238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450529128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2352#issuecomment-450529128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2352","id":450529128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDUyOTEyOA==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-29T23:49:00Z","updated_at":"2018-12-29T23:49:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think `functions` and `global_var_map_` should be always kept in sync, whenever we add a function, it should be reflected in `global_var_map_` as well, is it a fair assumption? \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why add the wrapper here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/8dd928c7092f76a98fe79e564bbb018c9cca278a/src/relay/pass/type_infer.cc#L546","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450529128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/450530937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2352#issuecomment-450530937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2352","id":450530937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDUzMDkzNw==","user":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-30T00:35:06Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T00:35:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think I understand what's going on now.

The runtime `TVMValue`  is raw, however, frontend needs `Debug + Display` and some idiomatic conversions. Therefore, `common`'s `TVMValue` has to be wrapped *at least*. \r\n\r\nBecause bindgen doesn't work for runtime, so either we should \r\n* include the generated raw c api in `common` entirely (same as runtime) \r\nor \r\n* include what needed such as raw `TVMValue` and `TVMTypeCode` and then, wrap and impl required conversions for *both* runtime and frontend (because of Orphan rule so that we won't need more wrapper boilerplates in either crates).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/451698707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/451702791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2336#issuecomment-451702791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2336","id":451702791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTcwMjc5MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-05T23:59:01Z","updated_at":"2019-01-05T23:59:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Huyuwei
