CI failure debug approach\n\nFirst thing to do in order to debug such issues: \n- link all raw build logs\n- extact and systematize failure resaons from logs (usulaly it's last 'exited with 1' message

JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-862?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN%20AND%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%29%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20flaky-test)\n\nUsually,

expect\\have in compile time. \nThis happens a lot when transitive dependencies bring new versions of the library you already have.\n\nI would start looking at Guava dependency version that you have in `mvn dependency:tree` to determine the \"offender\".\n\nHope this helps @rawkintrevo
