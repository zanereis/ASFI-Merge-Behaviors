If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change

sorry about that. The result will show null when there is no data. Why we don't show 0 any more is that we can't know it's no data or the true sum value is 0. Therefore, it's bug actually in 0.12.5, but it's fixed in 0.13.0. It will be fixed in 0.12.6 too. You may have to modify your code before.\r\n\r\n聚合结果在时间序列没有数据时会返回 null，因为此时如果返回0的话就不知道是因为没有数据还是真正的sum值就是0。\r\n因此0.12.5返回 0 其实是个bug，0.13.0 修复了这一bug，后续 0.12.6也会修复这个bug。因此可能需要您对之前的代码判断做一些修改。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1119195823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1119227488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/5808#issuecomment-1119227488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/5808","id":1119227488,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5Ctg5g","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T03:23:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T03:23:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"SonarCloud

Can you please provide more information about these two files?\r\n\r\n@HTHou \r\nIn fact, I don't want to add the exe files, too.    :-)     The reason is:\r\n1) Current IoTDB shutdown mechanism depends on signal  processing mechanism, which can work well in linux.\r\n2) Though Win OS also have signal  processing mechanism, but WinOS defautly have no cmd or tool (similiar to Linux kill cmd)  to send different signal to iotdb process.\r\n\r\nSo, for letting Win IoTDB has same shutdown flow to linux IoTDB, I need to find 1 Win tool that has similiar function to linux kill cmd.\r\nThe small tool is only used to send sigal to IoTDB process in win OS, and has no other special funciton for us.\r\nBut \r\n1) It is not easy to dev such tool in Win OS becasue of Windows' characters. \r\n2) I found 1 open source tool windows-kill.exe thant is similiar to linux Kill. But it is not easy to compile in our dev env.\r\n\r\nSo, I directly include the windows-kill (2 exe files) to IoTDB project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1122047806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1122142575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/5842#issuecomment-1122142575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/5842","id":1122142575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5C4olv","user":{"login":"xingtanzjr","id":18027703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDI3NzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18027703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr","html_url":"https://github.com/xingtanzjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingtanzjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-10T09:20:11Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T09:20:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1122142575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
