Maybe other arguments proposed here can \"kill\" the FINEST argument. At least it works as a shortcut or if used \"standalone\" after IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions. My new tests with many iterations revealed only one missed hit per try, but now it is rare maybe once per a big number like 256. So it does not resolve the issue completely, but changes the frequency it appears. I encourage users to use also the shortcut version and keep config to default. On tests with 256 iterations (reducing the sleep timings), if argument activated ok (checking the log), the FINEST reduces the frequency of the bug appearance. I got a missed hit at a random iteration, one at 14th on first try and one at 26th on the second. At least I can work now without much trouble.

I am not running NetBeans anymore but it stands to reason you could add enough logs to track the flow on success vs failure and diff the two. If you don't see ac difference, it means you need to add more logs until you catch the difference.

The code generated for different versions of EJB may be different. But I assume that it shouldn't break the build. So, if the project supports EJB 3.2, it's OK to generate code for EJB 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2. Code generated for EJB 4.0 wouldn't compile because it uses jakarta package prefix, so it's not good to offer it for projects that only support EJB 3.2 and not 4.0.\r\n\r\nThe other way around should also apply - options for generating EJB 3.2 code shouldn't be available for EJB 4.0 projects because then the generated code wouldn't compile.\r\n\r\nIf we want to bring back the option to generate Singleton EJBs for EJB 4.0, then we need to fix the generator to support EJB 4.0 and `jakarta` prefix. This is what I think has been done for Stateless and Stateful, but not for Singleton.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest to do with `isEjbXXSupported` and similar methods, is that we allow one exception - if EJB 4.0 is the latest version of EJB, then Netbeans offers generating EJB 4.0 code also for any newer EJB version, e.g. EJB 5.0. If EJB 5.0 introduces a breaking change, then older versions of Netbeans would allow generating EJB 4.0 code with EJB 5.0, which could generate code that doesn't compile. But this would be treated as a bug and newer versions of Netbeans should fix that and change the `isEjb40Supported` method to not allow EJB 4.0 code generation for EJB 5.0+ projects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1672738340/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1672770092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6319#issuecomment-1672770092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6319","id":1672770092,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5jtHIs","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-10T08:15:20Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T08:15:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I assume this is not actually a vulnerability in the VSCode plugin then?!  cc/ @MartinBalin ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1672770092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1672776857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4542#issuecomment-1672776857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4542","id":1672776857,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5jtIyZ","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-10T08:19:34Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T08:19:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, same issue - missed this report.
