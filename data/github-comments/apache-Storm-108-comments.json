for your feedback. I'm just getting started with (building) `storm`.\n\n> Python doesn't have package manager so if you don't have python, you need to install manually.\n\nI don't understand completely. Do you mean that `python` doesn't have a built-in package manager which allows bootstrapping `python.` Is that really necessary to mention? And is it important where people get their `python` from (source installation, package managers)? -> I'd leave users with the information that they need `python` & co and add links for famous OSs if people start to ask too many questions on the mailing list.\n\n> continue explaining RVM and NVM with clarifying it's for convenience, not requirement.\n\nWith `python`, `ruby` and `nodejs` installed I'm getting the (extremely unclear) error `Clojure failed` - I can provide more details if you want (I found https://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin/issues/80 which speculates that `Clojure failed` indicates missing binaries) -, so that imo `rvm` and `nvm` are a requirement - if not other build instructions are necessary because `mvn clean install` doesn't work out-of-the-box, like one might think after reading `DEVELOPER.md`. What is your insight into this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/140553259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612594230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4850#issuecomment-2612594230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4850","id":2612594230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTQyMzA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T21:45:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:58:15Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

This change just requires a recompile and explicitly calling out dependencies.  If I change the package that changes some APIs that we expose because we expose a TException in a few places.  That is why I didn't shade disruptor or kryo because both of them have pluggable interfaces exposed through configs, so I didn't want to touch anything that was directly exposed to the end user.  If we want to make the change we can, but I would like to see a separate JIRA for that.  This is to fix the builds so shading is working properly.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612594261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612594263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4850#issuecomment-2612594263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4850","id":2612594263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTQyNjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T14:54:45Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:58:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/736#discussion_r39639834\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/736#discussion_r39639834</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-dist/binary/src/main/assembly/binary.xml &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -30,38 +30,6 @@<br/>\n <useProjectArtifact>false</useProjectArtifact><br/>\n <outputDirectory>lib</outputDirectory><br/>\n <unpack>false</unpack></p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li><excludes>\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    Yes, the issue was partly that we didn't shade the libraries properly, but also we had excludes in there that were not needed.

I think layering something else like Make on top of Maven would complicate things.  Maven should be capable of building a complex setup like this correctly without needing to wrap it in some other build tool or some script.
