The the unit test and integration test jobs have parallel sub-jobs by using the matrix feature of Github Flows.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is the large size of Pulsar artifacts. Currently the ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/pulsar files installed with \"mvn install\" are about 2.5 GB in size.\r\nBreak down of directory sizes in MB:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/lhotari/3da3b220edd5684e54a005f358f3d045\r\n\r\nThe large size of artifacts seems to be caused by shaded and bundled dependencies. \r\nThe bundled dependencies seems to be the pulsar-io modules built with [nifi-nar-maven-plugin](https://github.com/apache/nifi-maven). This results in the excessive IO during builds.\r\n\r\nThe solution seems to be to create yet another maven profile that is for building just the essentials for running unit tests. Unit tests should be able to run without building the shaded jars, the distribution or the nar modules with the embedded dependencies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's also a way to share the dependencies across the Pulsar IO nar modules. It seems like a waste to duplicate most of the same dependencies in each nar file.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe size of the core-modules maven profile is already much lower than the total size of the Pulsar artifacts. \r\n`mvn install -Pcore-modules -DskipTests` produces about 377MB in ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/pulsar:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/lhotari/b6f51edc935787b530055a20bc685394\r\nThis could be reduced by 269MB, from 377MB to 108MB by removing the \"distribution/server\" module out of core-modules profile.\r\n\r\nSince the artifact cache of Github actions is 5GB in total for a repository, it would help a lot in being able to use the artifact cache for sharing the artifacts between the 1. phase and the later unit test and integration test phases of the build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/724474645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/724496861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8495#issuecomment-724496861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8495","id":724496861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDQ5Njg2MQ==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-10T06:43:12Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T06:43:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jennifer88huang

@codelipenghui ! \r\n\r\nIf it's something small, I could have a try but just to make it clear - I haven't observed DLQ not working with NACKs. \r\n\r\nI was just surprised by deadLetterPolicy() auto-setting ackTImeoutMillis to 30s and breaking my time-consuming message processing. And also confused by changes in #3014 implying that ackTImeoutMillis was necessary (but I now see that NACKs were implemented after the DLQ feature so makes sense why it was the default at that time).\r\n\r\nIf ackTimeoutMillis is no longer required for DLQ to work, would it make sense to change this default? Or would people be worried about this being a backwards-incompatible change as it would disable ack timeout for people who (possibly accidentally) enabled it by enabling the DLQ?\r\n\r\nBesides my confusion, there's another possible one that changing this default would prevent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsumerBuilder\r\n    .ackTimeout(0, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)\r\n    .deadLetterPolicy(DeadLetterPolicy.builder().build())\r\n    .subscribe()\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in ack timeout set to 30s but\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsumerBuilder\r\n    .deadLetterPolicy(DeadLetterPolicy.builder().build())\r\n    .ackTimeout(0, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)\r\n    .subscribe()\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in ack timeout disabled.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/725399618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/725402811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8513#issuecomment-725402811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8513","id":725402811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTQwMjgxMQ==","user":{"login":"BewareMyPower","id":18204803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower","html_url":"https://github.com/BewareMyPower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-11T12:44:13Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T12:46:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's introduced in #7487 , the flaky test is caused by the verification of key shared distribution like https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/61e62133a8d63210915e737c2affd6935fc3c528/pulsar-broker/src/test/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/KeySharedSubscriptionTest.java#L968-L973.\r\n\r\nAnd the C++ implementation is https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/61e62133a8d63210915e737c2affd6935fc3c528/pulsar-client-cpp/tests/KeySharedConsumerTest.cc#L132-L138\r\n\r\nSince C++ unit tests are running in parallel, I thought it may be easier to fail.

running into the same issue with a custom build of Pulsar built from v2.6.2-candidate-2 tag (same as v2.6.2).\r\nIn my case, I have a separate namespace with auto topic creation disabled and the application creates topics explicitly. \r\nThe scenario where this fails creates 7500 topics in 3 minutes at the rate of 25 topics/second. 5 messages are produced in the each created topic and then later on read using a reader (with 25 simultaneous \"virtual users\").  Things start failing very soon in this scenario. \r\n\r\nThe workaround is to [disable bundle auto splitting](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/administration-load-balance/#split-namespace-bundles) and use a reasonable default number of namespace bundles.. \r\n```\r\nloadBalancerAutoBundleSplitEnabled=false\r\ndefaultNumberOfNamespaceBundles=32\r\n```\r\nWith this workaround, Pulsar is able to handle the simple load test in a 3 node cluster (3 zk, 3 bookie, 3 broker).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/725514726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/725527533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8526#issuecomment-725527533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8526","id":725527533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTUyNzUzMw==","user":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-11T16:37:42Z","updated_at":"2020-11-11T16:37:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jiazhai
