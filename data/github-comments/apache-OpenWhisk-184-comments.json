The Controller\r\n2. The Invoker\r\n3. A Database\r\n4. A Message Queue.\r\n(5). Optionally an additional Scheduler.\r\n\r\nMost of the features in OpenWhisk are implemented using Service Provider Interfaces (SPI), and so many components can be specialized towards a specific implementation depending on your particular operational environment.\r\n\r\nThe `default' (or simplest) deployment, consists of:\r\n1. NGINX (load balancer)\r\n2. Controllers. (Authentication, Load Balancing, Scheduling Services)\r\n3. CouchDB (Database service)\r\n4. Kafka (Message Queue)\r\n5. Invokers (Container Management Services)\r\n6. API Gateway (Utilities for Exposing Web Actions)\r\n\r\nIn response to your specific points,\r\n\r\nMongoDB can be used as an alternative to CouchDB by configuring it in the relevant properties files in the Controller and Invokers. [Template](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/ansible/templates/whisk.properties.j2)\r\nRedis is used by the API Gateway. [Documentation](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/apigateway.md)\r\nElastic Search can be used as an alternative action log store. [Action Log Store Documentation](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions-new.md#logging)\r\n\r\nand Etcd is used by the new Scheduler component, which is most useful if you are deploying OpenWhisk on top of a container orchestration engine like Kubernetes. A little bit of the scheduler documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/proposals/POEM-2-function-pulling-container-scheduler.md).\r\n\r\nI agree with your general remark that some of the documentation is a bit out of date and disorganized though...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1833016104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1833115915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5454#issuecomment-1833115915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5454","id":1833115915,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5tQyEL","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-30T05:07:04Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T05:07:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There are two versions of OpenWhisk at the moment.\r\n\r\nOne is based on the ShardingPoolBalancer and the other is the new scheduler(FPCPoolBalancer).\r\nWe plan to release the next version of OpenWhisk that uses the new scheduler by default.\r\n(For now, the ShardingPoolBalancer is enabled by default.)\r\n\r\nAs @kcexn described above, the new scheduler requires as the name stands for, one more component \"scheduler\".\r\nAnd this scheduler component requires ETCD.\r\n\r\nOther than ETCD, other components are orthogonal to core components.\r\nYou can select ArtifactStore which stores actions and ActivationStore which stores activations.\r\nFor ArtifactStore, you can choose one of CouchDB and MongoDB; for ActivationStore, you can choose one of CouchDB, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch.\r\nThese stores can be used no matter which version of OpenWhisk you use.\r\n\r\nRegarding the documentation, these days, we are short-handed, so solicit help.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1833115915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1833137896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5454#issuecomment-1833137896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5454","id":1833137896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5tQ3bo","user":{"login":"kcexn","id":29589880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTg5ODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29589880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn","html_url":"https://github.com/kcexn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kcexn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-30T05:36:15Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T05:36:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@style95 with regards to documentation. \n\nThe biggest problem to me seems like organisation. Most things seem to be there, but not easily found.\n\nI think maybe if there was a hierarchy or a better sense of organisation around how the documentation should work, maintaining it would be much easier.\n\nE.g.
