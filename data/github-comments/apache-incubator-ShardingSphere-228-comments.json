From my point, if users configure single tables in the configuration, these single tables are likely to be applied to these default strategies, e.g., `defaultKeyGenerateStrategy`. On the other hand, when ShardingSphere automatically loads single tables, which means they are really single tables (configured single tables approximately are viewed as one-shard sharding tables).

Hi @chengh1\r\n> I know you must be swamped. But when you have time off, could you have a look here?\r\n\r\n@tristaZero \r\nIt’s been a long time since the pr was submitted, but there is a problem when running the integration test module. When using calcite to execute the join query, if the query field has a date type field, an exception which is  \"java.lang.ClassCastException: java.sql.Date cannot be cast to java.lang.Number\" will be thrown. I think there are some code problems in the integration test module when excuting with calcite, but I haven't found the reason yet, so it was delayed for a while. \r\nBecause I modified the logic of selecting the routing engine, some sql need to be executed using calcite, so some sql of the original integration test module will have problems when executed with calcite. For example,  the following SQL which is \"select t.*,o.item_id as item_id,(case when t.status = 'init' then '已启用' when t.status = 'failed' then '已停用' end) as stateName from t_order t left join t_order_item as o on o.order_id =t.order_id where t.order_id=1000 limit 1 \" contains Chinese, it will throw an encoding exception when executed with calcite, I have used the method of adding a calcite configuration file to specify charset as utf8 to resolved it,But there is still a problem which I mentioned above, I haven't found a solution yet.\r\nProblem link :
