There are three main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is just as flexible as having multiple interfaces. Imagine a \"MultiRequestLogger\" that can route different types of logs to different underlying loggers (SQL to kafka, native to file; or different files, etc). Sort of like the \"composing\" emitter we have.\r\n2. It is more powerful, in that it can do one thing that the multiple interfaces cannot: it can write different types of logs to the same file.\r\n3. Last but not least: it is simpler for users that are just getting started. They set up request logging one time, and all request logs go to the same place (of course, there should be a `logType` field that allows users to understand what is being logged). We could even extend this in the future to add exception logging and other sorts of structured logging (as opposed to log4j, which we use for _unstructured_ logging).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/425539467/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/425539501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6302#issuecomment-425539501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6302","id":425539501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTUzOTUwMQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T19:19:17Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T19:19:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/425539501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/425548573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6400#issuecomment-425548573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6400","id":425548573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTU0ODU3Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T19:56:42Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T19:56:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov are you using the Select query today?
