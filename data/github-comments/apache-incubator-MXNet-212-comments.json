I'm pretty sure that it would be possible.  On the GPU, the perf always depends on the memory access pattern, with 128-byte contiguous accesses being preferred. But yes, axis change should be doable. That would require another rewrite compared to the current PR, and so would probably be best left for another PR if we are to quickly o ptimize time-major at least. As far as I remember though, there are some things that are only implemented completely for either time-major or batch-major in MxNet anyway, one example being batch-dot. This is especially true for sequence models (TNC vs. NTC), maybe the axis issue is less pronounced in terms of support for images (NCHW vs. NHWC). But yes, I agree, that's a good next step, to support axis selection, for as many operators as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/313736061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/313765041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3677#issuecomment-313765041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3677","id":313765041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzc2NTA0MQ==","user":{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-07T18:55:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-07T18:55:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@szilard I confirmed on a  p2.xlarge instance with CUDA 7.5 and cuDNN 5.1\r\n\r\nYou should be able to quit R without any errors.\r\n\r\nI am closing this now.

found that baidu's flac to wav script has bug when it has short duration, it generates repeated sound file as  many 6 times or more.

And it makes label wrong, and can affect model's performance(both speed and accuracy). So I changed flac to wav converter from avconv to sox, and I found it generates identical outputs but fixes bug.

\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible to have a CSViter reworked so has to have something like a list of CSV files as argument rather than the current fixed `data` and `label`? This would facilitate the use of mixed or multiple data sources. It is something fairly straightforward to perform through R array iter right now, but ability to use a CSV iter would be a nice feature for larger datasets. I'm also thinking that such flexible CSV iter might be used to feed varying length RNN (assuming data has been previously processed into specific CSVs based on their bucket). \r\n\r\nFinally, is it desirable to assume there's an argument named `label`? Just like for other inputs that could be named `user` and `product` rather than `data`, I feel like it would improve model flexibility to have input arguments binded based on whatever arguments are fed by the iter value() rather than on some naming assumptions. \r\n\r\nAnyway, just some personal thoughts; thanks a lot for your work on
