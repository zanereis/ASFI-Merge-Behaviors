The last I saw I thought the decision was to only update the 4.0 (potentially 2.3-next) code base and to potentially backport to previously released versions with a context parameter. I'd like to see a vote so we can ensure everyone is on board with the decision, pros/cons, and default of any such context parameter. I'm fine with backporting fixes, however, removing support for browsers etc IMO warrants a more detailed discussion.

I'm trying to set the namedViewRoot to a boolean string in the root partial-response element.  This part seems to work fine. \r\n\r\nThe javascript would then extract the boolean to determine whether to prefix the container id to the jakarta.faces.viewstate in the name attribute of name. \r\n\r\nThe later two commits are a bit of a mess.  I'm not sure how exact namedViewRoot from the ajax response.  I tried `partials.namedViewRoot` and `partials.attributes.getAttribute(\"namedViewRoot\")`.

This can be worked out for the ajax case by doing a remapping before the xhr post, but for the non Ajax case where the input values and names are pushed down as they are this will not work!\r\n\r\nWe probably have to offer a challenge here, before starting to fix anything. The test might be wrong here or at least shooting over the top!\r\n\r\nEiter way for me it is clear I can determine that we are in a named scenario, if a prefix for a naming container is present in the update for the ViewState element, the only requirement I have is that this naming container must be determinable one way or the other on the page (if I cannot determine it, I have to guess the entire page is the naming container, portlets have clear naming container boundaries marked via identifiers)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1360961968/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1361308093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1361308093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1361308093,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5RI-m9","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-21T13:23:05Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T13:25:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not sure what the problem atm is by showing me conflicts... the branches are in sync but github is giving me sync problems to my private fork\r\nLets wait until this is resolved.\r\nOtherwise I need to refork before the final merge of this pr!
