The RPC you mentioned are \"old-school\" implementations which are more likely a proof of concept that machines can communicate with each other via a layer (RPC) higher than socket. But as the scale grows, engineers gradually need better libs, better debugging, better monitoring, and better performance. The modern RPC is actually a development base or environment for all services, containing many SOTA open-source or in-house software, and closely integrated with monitoring and data systems, to help engineers build, analyze and iterate systems more quickly and reliably.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/412254175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/412254226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/440#issuecomment-412254226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/440","id":412254226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjI1NDIyNg==","user":{"login":"jamesge","id":6566535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjY1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6566535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-11T06:07:12Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T06:07:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"channel不支持的，那个是适配server端的。你可以用mongodb自己的client","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/412254226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/412254727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/255#issuecomment-412254727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/255","id":412254727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjI1NDcyNw==","user":{"login":"jamesge","id":6566535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjY1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6566535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-11T06:19:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T06:19:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"主干的iobuf已经支持[append用户数据](https://github.com/brpc/brpc/blob/c22b29d0aa901a7d8afa6e1ced0e41b5ad4dbe92/src/butil/iobuf.h#L236)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/412254727/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/comments/412268571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/398#issuecomment-412268571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/398","id":412268571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjI2ODU3MQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-11T11:13:32Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T11:13:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
