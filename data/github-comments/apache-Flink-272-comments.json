A lot in this PR goes in a very good direction. We would suggest some not too large changes. Please let us know if you agree, we may have also overlooked or misinterpreted some implications.\r\n\r\n**Desired Goals**\r\n\r\n  - Once this PR is merged, Flink should be in a releasable state, meaning that it should not matter if we manage to upgrade all serializers to the new model before the release. That is important for the time-based releasing and the uncertainty with respect to Scala code generation in serializers, etc. If we manage to upgrade half of Flink's serializers, it should be perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n  - There are also users have written customer serializers and with that, custom config snapshots. We cannot expect that they update them strictly in sync with our release. It would be good for users to have an easy way to adjust their customer serializers' config snapshots such that they still work.\r\n\r\n  - The current code follows the assumption that in order to be upgraded (1) serializers need to bump strictly one version and (2) on their backwards compatibility paths, read first the serializer (via Java serialization) and then the config snapshot data. Any serializer not following this strict contract will have errors during the reading of the config snapshot data. That seems a hard and fragile contract, especially considering that users also need to follow that path for upgrades.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Change**\r\n\r\n  - We do not completely remove the Java Serialization for serializers, but make it optional. Config Snapshots can decide whether they want the prior serializer to be serialized into the meta info or not. This is similar to the current backwards compatibility path, but does not put the serialized serializer into the same byte stream and does not making the assumption that the specific value of the version tells you that.\r\n\r\n  - We extend the `TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot` class as suggested below. This tells the config snapshot writer whether to write the previous serializer. It also removes the need for the \"Backward Compatible Wrapper\", because the TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot handles the bridging directly.\r\n\r\n  - We introduce (possibly later PR) the `SerializerConfigSnapshotBackwardsAdapter` and the new `SerializerConfigSnapshot`. All updated config snapshots should extend the `SerializerConfigSnapshot` and the not updated ones should extend the `SerializerConfigSnapshotBackwardsAdapter`. We can then make the methods in TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot abstract.\r\n\r\n  - Once we decide we have given enough of a grace period for users to update their serializers and config snapshots, we remove the optional serialization of the previous serializer, remove the old `TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot` class and only keep the new `SerializerConfigSnapshot` class.\r\n\r\n  - This should follow the same spirit as this PR, but introduce fewer subtle contracts and decouple versioning from the removal of the Java serialization.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class TypeSerializerConfigSnapshot<T> extends VersionedIOReadableWritable {\r\n\r\n    private TypeSerializer<T>priorSerializer;\r\n\r\n    public boolean needsPriorSerializerPersisted() { return true; }\r\n\r\n    public void setPriorSerializer(TypeSerializer<T> prior) { this.priorSerializer = prior; }\r\n\r\n    public TypeSerializer<T>getPriorSerializer() { return this.priorSerializer; }\r\n\r\n

If there is another committer that is, it might be obvious to merge this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/425413268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/425415727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6491#issuecomment-425415727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6491","id":425415727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTQxNTcyNw==","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T12:10:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T12:10:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@uce I understand your concerned and sorry to involve you here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/425415727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/425418399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6759#issuecomment-425418399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6759","id":425418399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTQxODM5OQ==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T12:22:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T12:22:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Clarkkkkk when you rebase the PR, please use `git pull --rebase`.
