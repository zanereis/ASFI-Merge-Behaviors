However, I then ran into a new problem... Because what you produce is ostensibly a 'c source' file (even if it's empty), all the external modules are also exported as c files. This results in having to do a proper compile when you try and merge all the modules together to produce a shared library. If one of your external modules happens to be a binary artifact that's 150MB (my case), this compile uses an incredible amount of RAM and takes a long time to complete. I didn't get this problem with your first solution as it used an LLVMModule (I think?) which results in the external modules becoming object files so all you need to do is link, not perform a full compilation.\r\n\r\nThis is because our new `ModulePackImportsToLLVM` simplifies compilation and generate object file directly, it is designed for large artifact like your case.\r\n\r\n> The reason that LLVMModule simplifies compilation is because it remembers the correct target triple. We can try to enhance the code by introducing an Empty LLVM module(with the correct target) when it is available(so that Q2 can be resolved) and fallback to the CSourceModule.\r\n  cc @FrozenGene who created the mechanism for the binary exporting\r\n\r\nI agree we could create empty llvm module if we have llvm target support, then we could fallback to CSourceModule.  We could refer logic here:\r\n```cpp\r\nruntime::Module build(const Map<Target, Array<LoweredFunc>>& inputs,\r\n                      const Target& target_host,\r\n                      const BuildConfig& config)\r\n  Target target_host_val = target_host;\r\n  if (!target_host.defined()) {\r\n    for (const auto& it : inputs) {\r\n      if (it.first->device_type == kDLCPU) {\r\n        target_host_val = it.first;\r\n        break;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (!target_host_val.defined()) {\r\n    target_host_val = DefaultTargetHost(target_host_val);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere, we have logic to detect and extract the correct target host. According to this, we could know whether we have LLVM (with correct target).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/585527191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/585575763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4866#issuecomment-585575763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4866","id":585575763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTU3NTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-13T06:38:43Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T06:38:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Given this PR involves a major technical decisions(introducing hashtable to the runtime), can you please open discuss RFC thread in the discuss forum first to discuss possible technical choices? In this way we can converge to the best design that fits our goals\n\nBy quickly looking at the PR, I can see a few places that can be improve(which we can discuss in depth in the RFC). In particular, we don't have to introduce additional C APIs to the FFI, and should consolidate everything to use the Object instead. While relay's VM runtime already supports Object, it would be interesting to ask whether we want to extend some level of support to the graph RT\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4882?email_source=notifications&email_token=ADFIA7BQADJRSYEMRWPGHXDRC3ABXA5CNFSM4KVGRWJ2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOELZSF5Y#issuecomment-586359543>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ADFIA7C7NOKKXWLQFYOGWI3RC3ABXANCNFSM4KVGRWJQ>.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/586703234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/586748780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4895#issuecomment-586748780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4895","id":586748780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Njc0ODc4MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-16T20:25:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-16T20:25:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"perhaps https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4896  is a cleaner approach","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/586748780/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/586749061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4891#issuecomment-586749061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4891","id":586749061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Njc0OTA2MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-16T20:27:56Z","updated_at":"2020-02-16T20:27:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, sorry for not being clear, the root problem is potential ties in the value generated by np.random(two values too close to each other).

I totally understand limited time.\r\n> \r\n> You are right, I do not include a case for Android to skip linking with pthread. My only excuse was can't really find a solid answer to this in CMake. \"if(ANDROID)\" would be nice if that's how it is done. I'll be very happy to implement any suggestion though!\r\n> \r\n> I made this \"first class\" option from the main CMake because a) Its a much better implementation on Windows than the python version, which took a bunch of hacks to make decent performance. b) Was very easy to link to the tvm libs given its a sub CMake project.\r\n\r\nI agree all about the advantages of CMake. For Android, I think the [CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.html) maybe could help us. But it requires the users to specify the build os, I prefer we do it automatically, i.e. we could use the compiler option `-dumpmachine` to get we are in the android or linux.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I run:\r\n` ~/ndk_tools/bin/clang -dumpmachine`, it will output: `aarch64-none-linux-android`\r\nIf I run arm linux compiler, it will output: `aarch64-linux-gnueabi`.\r\n\r\nSo I think we could this to distinguish android or linux. If we can not run this command successfully, we do the default things. \r\n\r\nPlease make sure this [Android ndk tools](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) and [linaro linux] (https://www.linaro.org/downloads/) could compile cpp/rpc successfully, because they are important platforms to use cpp_rpc. (Note. these two tools has windows os support too)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/586882243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/586890441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4497#issuecomment-586890441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4497","id":586890441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Njg5MDQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-17T09:12:21Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T09:12:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ping @zhiics @kazum @FrozenGene  please review the change you requested.
