@reta That makes, given that the `*Async` methods all allow have a variation that allows the user to pass in an executor.  And they should be able to get the executor service used in the client via the `executorService` property (see `AbstractClient.EXECUTOR_SERVICE_PROPERTY`) in the config (in CXF anyway - not sure about other JAX-RS implementations).  My initial reading of the spec led me to believe that the default executor for subsequent CompletionStages should be the same as the initial one, but as long as the user can continue to re-use that executor, I think we can close this PR.

I figured the safest thing was a new method to clear the headers, so as to not disrupt other code flows.  \r\n\r\nI did make a couple more changes though - the spec also says that the user can pass in a null headers map, which means that we need to just clear the headers - so I added a null check.  I also changed the `removeAllHeaders` method to clear the headers map rather than creating a new one.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/362296701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/362481200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/373#issuecomment-362481200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/373","id":362481200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjQ4MTIwMA==","user":{"login":"andymc12","id":21365299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzY1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21365299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12","html_url":"https://github.com/andymc12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-02T04:12:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T04:12:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added a new commit.

FYI, I found implementing all of these Configuration/Configurable very challenging, I recall typing and thinking I was not really sure if I was on the wrong or right path :-) as the original docs were quite compact, and the interpretation of some signatures can vary even today.\r\n\r\nMy own initial understanding was that it was primarily about supporting new filters/interceptors, given that in 2.0 (and in 2.1 for the most non-filter/non-interceptor interfaces) no priorities existed for MBR/MBW (and today for ex for ExceptionMapper or ParamConverterProvider) while many register methods accept the priorities or have the default priorities which have no any processing reqs for the last 2 interfaces and in 2.0 - for MBR/MBW as well.  Hence those supported types lists (for client/server) only included the new 2.0 filter/interceptors and only later I started adding the support for the wider set of standard types. \r\n\r\nBut  anyway, the patch looks fine, except that the supported contracts still need to be passed in, this is to protect Server-side Configuration from accepting ClientRequest/ResponseFilter and the client side Configuration - from ContainerRequest/ResponseFilter.   These supported types lists may need to be expanded for the client and server (to include all other standard types which make sense on the client and the server) such that a provider can not be registered under SomeNonJaxrsContract - which should be rejected\r\n\r\nThanks    ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/364092698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/364094956","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/379#issuecomment-364094956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/379","id":364094956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDA5NDk1Ng==","user":{"login":"sberyozkin","id":467639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/467639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin","html_url":"https://github.com/sberyozkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-08T12:18:31Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T12:18:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm...May be the registration of the unknown types should not be blocked as I suspect this is how many users are already registering CXF specific providers with register(...) without the base implementation having any knowledge of the scope of such providers. \r\nSo IMHO it should only be limited to blocking the well-known server interfaces in the client scope and vice versa.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/364094956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/364164854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/379#issuecomment-364164854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/379","id":364164854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDE2NDg1NA==","user":{"login":"andymc12","id":21365299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzY1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21365299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12","html_url":"https://github.com/andymc12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-08T16:21:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T16:21:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @sberyozkin - that makes sense.
