Adding `(log-message (str storm-libs \":\" tplg-jar-file))` before `(log-message \"topology cmd \" tplg-cmd-response)` helps debugging what classpath is applied with TopologySubmitter. Without my patch it just prints out `/opt/apache-storm-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/*:/tmp/storm-starter-topologies-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`, which is not same as `storm jar`.\n2. Seems like TopologySubmitter cannot see storm.conf during uploadTopology.

`System.currentTimeMillis()`).</p>\n\n<p>    My reasoning behind documenting the values (as opposed to the kafka API constants) is that the start offset time is likely to be specified via configuration (i.e. outside java code). Either that, or add spout constants that would get evaluated to `EarliestTime()`/`LatestTime()` if for some reason those values were ever changed in the Kafka API &#8211; that seems like a less \"leaky\" solution.</p>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612511614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612535511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4582#issuecomment-2612535511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4582","id":2612535511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MzU1MTE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-31T21:14:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:29:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Subtask

it's on JVM.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I think it is a natural behavior. If you use normal Bolt, your JVM process will have an issue unless you increase enough parallelism or worker count.<br/>\nSubprocess still have a chance to launch threads or processes to take care of flooding tuples. In this situation launching threads seems not resolve this issue cause it is a parser and python (normally) uses GIL.</p>\n\n<p>Could you have more Parser ShellBolt workers and see it
