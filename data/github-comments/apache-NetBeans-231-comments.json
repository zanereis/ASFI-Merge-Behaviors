The tree is often shallow and the whole row is selectable, so locking it to the left makes sense I believe. (suggestion taken from the linked issue and mailing list)\r\n\r\n> I would raise the question, whether it would be possible to persist the divider location into options as is done for search results.\r\n\r\nThe divider memory is a bit of an afterthought, I didn't implement it at first. The reason for this is because this is essentially management code for many different refactoring views. It would have to persist it on a per-view-type manner. I am also not sure if there is even a good default or initial value. I think it is very usecase dependent and might not make sense to persist. \r\n\r\nHowever, if the user runs a refactoring preview with slider position X, the second time it is run might look good with the same position from before since it is probably the same codebase. So maybe in-memory persistence is good enough / potentially better anyway?\r\n\r\nThis might look patchy but the way it is implemented:\r\n```java\r\n        if (splitPane.getDividerLocation() < MIN_DIVIDER_LOCATION) {\r\n            if (dividerPosMemory > MIN_DIVIDER_LOCATION) {\r\n                splitPane.setDividerLocation(dividerPosMemory);\r\n            } else {\r\n                splitPane.setDividerLocation(0.3);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nmeans that the whole logic won't be active if the concrete view is setting a width via regular layout logic - this would already move the divider at this point and the whole thing is skipped.\r\n\r\nBut maybe I am overthinking this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2562005451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2562017778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8088#issuecomment-2562017778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8088","id":2562017778,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6YtUny","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-25T22:59:09Z","updated_at":"2024-12-25T22:59:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> And this was nagging at me: There is also `BasicReplaceResultsPanel`.

However, I can't test this since win 11 does not let me upgrade to 24H2 in vbox.\r\n\r\nthere is also https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8058#issuecomment-2549327349","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2562086012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2562086953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8049#issuecomment-2562086953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8049","id":2562086953,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Ytlgp","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-26T02:27:50Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T02:27:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"its likely time to retire NBI since it isn't maintained anyway and only used for windows, the community installers work fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2562086953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2562106499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8088#issuecomment-2562106499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8088","id":2562106499,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6YtqSD","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-26T03:07:08Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T03:08:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing added the change to the first commit.

and Colleagues (those with NetBeans-23 problems),\n\nI did try the method suggested of saving a copy of \"registry.xml\", replacing the\nreferences to \"24\" to \"23\", and again attempting the uninstall of NetBeans-23.\nThis still failed, due, I believe, to perhaps also having to replace the build\nnumber.\n\nSo, having tried a scalpel, I decided to try a chain saw.\n\nI copied and saved the entire \".nbi\" folder, and renamed the NetBeans-23 folder\nin \"Program Files.\" I then reinstalled NetBeans-23, and this was successful.\nI then immediately uninstalled that new installation, and that was also\nsuccessful. The following steps were then to delete the renamed NetBeans-23\nfolder, and restore the \".nbi\" folder.\n\nA nearly as I can determine from checking all my projects and settings in the\nNetBeans-24 installation, nothing has changed, and it (so far) is working as\nexpected.\n\nMy assumption (and somebody at Apache please verify) that uninstalling the\nnewly installed NetBeans-23 would have also cleaned up all related settings\neverywhere, so now my system is now really clean of anything \"23\".\n\nNevertheless, the uninstaller needs to be repaired. It does claim that it can\nproceed without the needed entries in \"registry.xml\", and certainly goes\nthrough the motions of presenting the right dialogs all the way to \"Finish,\" But\nin the meantime, does nothing. (This is a violation of the contract with the user.)\n\nThe whole point of having an uninstaller is to clean an application out of the\nsystem, and it should be able to do that even if the application is broken (the\nalternative is to be left with a system with a collection of broken versions of\napplications). This means it must have the capability of going everywhere\nlooking for the references to the application that it \"knows\" should exist and be\nremoved and cleaning them up, even if some are missing data that are\nexpected.

Your best chance to improve this usecase is to try to get involved yourself and figure out why deploy-on-save runs so often.\r\n\r\nThe underlying compile-on-save mechanism sidelines the project build and lets NB directly compile to the output folder. This is the root cause for many other issues and essentially deprecated since no longer maintained (CoS itself is also fairly complex). Today, the project build tools like maven or gradle are responsible for all this, NB only interfaces with the tools, scans input and output etc.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that the second part of the fix is to run your application on java versions which don't use permgen anymore.

The intermediate structure we need to focus on is the `StructureItem`. The CSL API processes this to generate the navigator structure view and the breadcrumbs for example. The results from a usages search (\"Find All Subtype\") for that class gives a list, that seems to be manageable (round about 10 subclasses).

After some research, I found that @-ms-keyframes was part of a beta for IE 10 but was discarded in the final version and shortly before IE10 release MSDN marked @-ms-keyframes as deprecated. So yes, that's not part of CSS standards anymore. But in NetBeans 23 it wasn't marked as an error, that's why I commented on this. I deleted that tag in my code to avoid that error, so there are no major issues here... ;)\r\n\r\nAbout @-ms-viewport, I'm not talking about the device-width warning but the @-ms-viewport error itself:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"407\" alt=\"Captura de pantalla 2024-12-31 144801\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8313cd42-e875-41c3-8598-4e0345ab8486\" />\r\n\r\nIt is happening in both Bootstrap 3.3.7 and 3.4.1 (minified versions) that are included in external plugins included in my project. It seems that @-ms-viewport has been deprecated too (not used in Edge, only in IE 10), but I guess Bootstrap was just trying to keep compatibility with old browsers like IE 10. Anyhow, that error was not marked before in NetBeans 23 and now it is, at least in my NetBeans 24 after replacing org-netbeans-modules-css-lib.jar with the new version, that's why I'm also mentioning this. \r\n\r\nJust trying to help... :)\r\n\r\nBTW: Happy New Year to everybody!!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2566489810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2566548698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8102#issuecomment-2566548698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8102","id":2566548698,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Y-mza","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-31T15:47:10Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T15:47:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could be something with the weak references. some of the unused tooltips are actually displayed, usually just once, then they are gone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2566548698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2566661978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8102#issuecomment-2566661978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8102","id":2566661978,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Y_Cda","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-31T19:00:36Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T19:00:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please have a look at #8103.

Since the icons had the same name I assumed they are supposed to represent the same thing, and that the vertical bar is a newer simplified version. (There's a whole visual language invented by the original designer, where vertical bar means static, blue square means field etc.)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3653c8e7-753b-43b4-99cb-a1b7925db731)\r\n\r\nSo for this one I'd be inclined to keep the current mapping to the simple vertical bar for all of them. Alternatively I could exclude the two icons that have the more elaborate design.\r\n\r\n> From context java/java.source/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/source/resources/icons/initializer.svg should look different to java/java.source/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/source/resources/icons/constructorPublic.svg\r\n\r\nAh, I see the hollowed-out diamonds (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77501513-b0d4-4bc5-bff4-20e5bb43fbbc)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3bc382-51a2-425e-afd4-79574c6bd1bf)) might be intended to distinguish initializers from constructors. But grepping through the source code, it seems the hollowed-out versions of the two icons are never actually used anywhere. Did you observe them somewhere in the GUI?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d56e7a09-9c6d-41fd-9bec-423f9a1254ba)\r\n\r\n> The icons java/maven.repository/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/repository/localrepo.svg and java/maven.repository/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/repository/remoterepo.svg should have different visualization as they are used to discern local from remote repo.\r\n\r\nYou're right! Will fix that. In fact, I think \"repo\" (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/813a75fb-febc-489e-add3-68f4ab9c4b69)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62a71abe-8639-4a8c-9c65-016cb4861b22)) should be separate from \"database\" (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b567f33b-30a0-4d35-baf8-29a92a489f7c)). I'll make separate icons for those (different color, no platter bars).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2566991747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2567013674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8008#issuecomment-2567013674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8008","id":2567013674,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6ZAYUq","user":{"login":"homberghp","id":4232630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4232630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp","html_url":"https://github.com/homberghp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homberghp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-01T13:38:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T13:38:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#

If you installed Netbeans 24, you should have seen a warning message about registry.xml. The message is right: you have lost all the information about NB 23 in registry.xml. I made a backup of registry.xml before installing NB24, so i could fix my registry.xml by adding the information about my NB 23 products from my backup to the registry.xml in \\.nbi with the NB 24 information.\r\n\r\n1. After you have fixed your registry.xml, look for the default-uri entry for an icon of a NB 24 product, mine was:\r\n<default-uri>file:/C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/Temp/nbi9486179336385376691/icon.png</default-uri>\r\n\r\n2. Then, look for the default-uri entry for an icon of a NB 23 product, mine was:\r\n<default-uri>file:/C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/Temp/nbi14108944310562826630/icon.png</default-uri>\r\n\r\n3.

The existing actions need additional `ActionReferences` added in a new path (eg. probably [here](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectTab.java#L875)), and the button bar needs to load its actions from that new path, with the necessary context.

So please sorry very basic questions.\r\n\r\nYes, i meant extracting implementation of both \"collapse\" and \"navigate to selected\" as an \"actions\" which are properly annotated. To be honest at this point I do not quite understand what is ActionReference. The only doc I\"ve found is this one https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/main/netbeansdevelopperfaq/DevFaqHowOrganizeOrReuseExistingActionsWithAnnotations/ but unfortunately for me this page is not very detailed and does not really explain what is ActionReference and what values should be for \"path\" and \"position\".\r\n\r\nAs for icons - I've found two different examples here https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/main/netbeansdevelopperfaq/DevFaqAddIconToContextMenu/ and here https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/main/netbeansdevelopperfaq/DevFaqToggleActionAddToEditorToolbar/ \r\nOne of these examples is for toolbar icon and the other one is for context menu. But I am not putting icons into context menu or default toolbar. I am putting them into view directly\r\n```\r\n        ImageIcon collapseTreeIcon = ImageUtilities.loadImageIcon(\"org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/resources/collapseTree.svg\",false);\r\n        JButton collapseAllButton = new JButton();\r\n        collapseAllButton.setIcon(collapseTreeIcon);\r\n        ...\r\n        buttonPanel.add(collapseAllButton);\r\n```\r\nDo I need to define icon using annotation in this case? Is there any example you can point me to so that I could check how to define icon in action itself for such case which is neither toolbar nor context menu?\r\n\r\nAs for action execution I assume you've meant using this approach https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/main/netbeansdevelopperfaq/DevFaqInvokeActionProgrammatically/ right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2568108137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2568127530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8040#issuecomment-2568127530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8040","id":2568127530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6ZEoQq","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-02T17:33:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T17:33:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mbien I'm not sure if it would help address this issue, as I'm not sure whether it would change what's returned, but it does look like we might be able to get rid of all the reflection usage in that class now?  eg. https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.desktop/share/classes/javax/swing/filechooser/FileSystemView.java#L653","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2568127530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2568185376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7925#issuecomment-2568185376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7925","id":2568185376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6ZE2Yg","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-02T18:21:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T18:21:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The actions already exist and are registered.  With the `Project UI` module open in the IDE, look under `Important Files / XML Layer / <this layer in context>`.  You can see a reference to the collapse all action under the `ProjectTabActions` folder, which is the path for `ProjectsRootNode.ACTIONS_FOLDER`.  The path for the additional reference is up to you, but could be something like `ProjectTabButtonPanel` ??\r\n\r\nYou need to add an `iconBase` on the existing action registration at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectTab.java#L874 with a path to the icon in the resources folder - see similar at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectTabAction.java#L40  Use a png file as the base - an svg with the same name should be picked up from there.\r\n\r\nAdd an additional `ActionReference` to the action - eg. `@ActionReference(path=\"ProjectTabButtonPanel\", position = 100)`  Use similar registration on the other action, with a higher position so it loads in the right order.\r\n\r\nTo load the actions to use in your panel, use `Utiltiies.actionsForPath(\"ProjectTabButtonPanel\", Lookups.singleton(ProjectTab.ID_LOGICAL))`.  The context is the same as used at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/projectui/src/org/netbeans/modules/project/ui/ProjectsRootNode.java#L116  Note use of `ProjectTab.ID_PHYSICAL` for the Files tab.\r\n\r\nThe `Action[]` returned from that path may contain `null` for defining separators.\r\n\r\nTo create the buttons for your panel then do something at simplest like - \r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (Action a : actions) {\r\n  if (a != null) {\r\n    JButton button = new JButton();\r\n    Actions.connect(button, a);\r\n    // add button to bar\r\n  } else {\r\n    // add a separator or ignore\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps you get going in the right direction.  Apologies for any mistakes - writing some from memory! :smile:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2568185376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2568206288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8107#issuecomment-2568206288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8107","id":2568206288,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6ZE7fQ","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-02T18:39:59Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T18:39:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks!
