Please use gitter https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\r\n\r\nThere seem to be two questions here.. one is a question about cleanups for MySQL. Another is a question about the zipkin-js project. In both cases, you should talk on gitter. I'll give breadcrumbs but please follow-up on Gitter, not here, as it spams watchers.\r\n\r\non mysql: it is mentioned in our README that mysql is not for production usage. Its schema can result in indexing issues as you just described actually.  The overall storage is mentioned [here](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-storage/mysql-v1), but I'm not going to feed a cleanup job as again, this is not a supported production environment.\r\n\r\non undesirable data: In general, it is best to drop undesirable data before it gets to Zipkin. For example, Brave has \"finishedspanhandler\". zipkin-js does not have this, but also no one has requested it. Please ask for features on a relevant repo as this repo is for the server.\r\n\r\nThe closest feature to what's being asked is CollectedSpanHandler. This can drop data for any reason. However, no one has even upvoted the issue. Please express your interest here if you want zipkin to drop data for you https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2807\r\n\r\nRegardless, please use gitter first next time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/535380173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/535416660","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2736#issuecomment-535416660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2736","id":535416660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTQxNjY2MA==","user":{"login":"tacigar","id":19551419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTUxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19551419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar","html_url":"https://github.com/tacigar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacigar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-26T09:16:34Z","updated_at":"2019-09-26T09:16:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![reroot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19551419/65675614-733c8c00-e089-11e9-8598-0dc5bd5b21f9.gif)\r\n\r\nReroot

However, the way ES behaves adds to the concern. I talked with @basvanbeek about making a commandline option to display what the index template should be. Right now, only ES doesn't have a way to create the schema at setup time (without starting and stopping a zipkin server). This is due to the amount of compatability issues in ES and also that certain parameters are site specific. OTOH, we could probably make a static one that people can hand tune.

It indeed only checks whether the index is available. Other endpoints like `spanStore` all ensure index templates. But I'm not sure if adding that to health check would change anything - right now, parallel calls to `spanStore` have a race between ensuring indexes, but otherwise parallel calls to `check` would have a similar race IIUC.\r\n\r\nThis documentation implies that index creation does take some time to propagate to shards\r\n\r\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html#create-index-wait-for-active-shards\r\n\r\nMy relatively wild guess is that nodes that have had the template propagated to them will respond to the `get-template` request successfully even when other nodes have not created it yet. And now that we're actually round-robining, this means `get-template` can succeed on a node but the span is sent to a following node where it hasn't succeeded yet. One shard will index spans with the template, the other will not (until the next day though when a new index is created, heh). This behavior seems quite dangerous, but I guess to solve it, it would be nice to have an option when indexing to wait for any pending template operations in the cluster which I don't see at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-index_.html \r\n\r\nLooked through elastic docs to see if they provide a simple way to know status of index templates better (a scatter-gather as we've been implementing recently? ;) ), but can't find any. Simplest way to solve might be to just make sure our `get-template` call succeeds on all endpoints in an

By default there aren't many logs, but enabling access logs of server and/or client could have lots and are possibly useful for certain sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly i can't tell. Gut feeling says 'simple' should be 'faster' but yeah not always true. It's literally just 5 classes of which 4 dealing with config. https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j/tree/master/slf4j-simple/src/main/java/org/slf4j/simple . The logging method itself is nothing exotic https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j/blob/233803688a809fa8ea599306a058351d4c4246a4/slf4j-simple/src/main/java/org/slf4j/simple/SimpleLogger.java#L362 .

I guess it's fairly simple to override the logging settings at a site, one useful override I can imagine is switching to JSON layout to integrate with JSON-based logging collectors. Is this something we don't support? (just confirming, want to avoid accidentally losing something we do support)\r\n\r\nslf4j-simple would not support this indeed.\r\n\r\n> * log4j plugins.

No clue on this, but I imagine the number of servers that use slf4j-simple in the wild in production is close to zero, wonder if we'll run into something unexpected\r\n\r\nthat might be a bit

About the duration 1 issue. trying to solve the programming cleanliness indeed does help. Duration 1 as a solution raised strong antibodies, but I don't think that was your original intent. I wanted to make sure that didn't happen as then we would have to immediately undo it. I'm sorry as I was literally presenting at the time, it was hard for me to give complete context.\r\n\r\nI'm most concerned about adding a 1 duration as that will make it hard to see errors or incomplete spans. Also, I'm worried about alignments and things, or people wondering why it took 1us. We have an existing issue somewhere to alert people about broken or incomplete traces, and don't want to make that harder to do. That's why I had strong pushback about coercing absent duration to 1.\r\n\r\n* When I mentioned that duration 1 is the only valid one I meant to emphasize we can use this to our advantage. That knowing this zero is the same as absent. If we have numerical calculations, we can use zero, in other words.\r\n* when I said \"span cleaner\" I literally meant src/zipkin/span-cleaner.js. For example, here we add an empty list for annotations for reasons such as this.\r\n\r\nSo, to put it all together :) I didn't say explicitly, wasn't online really or anything and it was hard for me to see the contexts of the different angles.. but here's the advice.\r\n\r\nIt is normal to have span cleaning, knowing duration is 0 is same as absent, then change span-cleaner to backfill zero duration. I think this will solve the programming problem. Adding (getting total duration of a row, which I think this comment was about) is ok.\r\n\r\nMain thing if we do this is make sure code that does percentage skips span with zero duration: we don't yet know their duration. Be careful to check, that's all. I don't even remember if we do *any* percentage anymore in the UI, so this point might be a relic of the old one.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/538602812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/538700208","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2736#issuecomment-538700208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2736","id":538700208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODcwMDIwOA==","user":{"login":"jeqo","id":6180701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODA3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6180701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo","html_url":"https://github.com/jeqo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-06T00:21:41Z","updated_at":"2019-10-06T00:21:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"nit:

I suspect there is a way to phrase the why.. for example this stops having to weed through things discovered implicitly via the classpath. for example the factories are primarily discovered via the classpath which is why I used the term scanning though I admit I forgot that was a historical term for something more deep. at any rate some suggestion of a non scary way and also honest would be appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/541624025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/541697375","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2840#issuecomment-541697375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2840","id":541697375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTY5NzM3NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-14T14:03:53Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T14:03:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"added tests to 100% coverage and moved rationale around with a note that someone can refactor later as they wish.
