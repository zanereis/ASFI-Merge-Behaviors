Hi @totalo ,\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for your continued improvement. This PR looks fine with me, and we can consider the following two points for the next PR,\r\n> \r\n> 1. Remove the stale `StandardMetaDataContexts ` constructor\r\n> 2. Add a tableName field in `TableMetaData` wo avoid `Map<Map<String, TableMetaData>, Map<String, TableMetaData>> build()`\r\n> \r\n> Also, @Beyondeclipse, do you think this PR has room to improve in #10911? Could you give more explanation?\r\n> \r\n> @terrymanu , could you have a look at `ShardingSphereRulesBuilder.java` of this PR, since I saw it involves your `todo` comment?\r\n\r\n@tristaZero @totalo \r\nI think bellows can be discussed：\r\n1. The loading schema method \"SchemaBuilder#build\" may use datasourceName/datasourceObject as filter key word to avoid duplicate loading is better,  while it uses tableNames now.\r\n2. There 3 ways to load the schemas, and may be reduced or improved: \r\n   1) DialectTableMetaDataLoader based, multi-thread for specified DatabaseType.\r\n   2) SchemaMetaDataLoader.loadAllTableNames,  which use Connection.getMetaData to load, single-thread.\r\n   3) TableMetaDataBuilder.load, which use Connection.getMetaData to load too. \r\n   And I am confused about these :\r\n   a. What is the difference between 2) and 3) loading methods? Can one replace the other？\r\n   b. Why 3) use multi-thread to load one tableName in all the datasources? It seems not to be effective.

ShardingTableMetaDataBuilder\r\n\r\nhi , @Beyondeclipse  @tristaZero \r\nFor 1, I understand that the rules used in the `Schemabuilder#build` method are from the upper layer `Map<String, Collection< RuleConfigs >> SchemarUleConfigs,` His key is `schemName`.\r\n\r\nFor 2.a, I think looking at each loader separately, one gets `SchemaMetadata` about some attributes of the schema such as the table, and the other gets `TableMetadata`. You can see that TableMetadata is more about some attribute values of each column in the table. And the bottom implementation of the TableTableBuilder is also `ColumnMetadateLoader`. In this scenario,I think. Do not use the` SchemaMetaDataLoader loadAllTableNames`, also can meet, but there is a risk that has been loaded table repeat live load.\r\nfor 2.b, I agree with you, but the explanation I can think of is that we need to query each `DataNode`, so multithreading may be faster.\r\nThe above is my understanding, not sure whether it is correct or not, but also hope to correct.
