Thanks for pushing this forward. Indeed I think we are pretty close. \r\n\r\nOne basic point that we need to agree on before I do full review of the new part is the duration & frequency of running the new tests. I see that the new tests are tagged as `Slow`. Currently we run `Slow` tests on every commit that lands in master and without the changes under this PR they take ~30minutes.\r\n\r\nHow much time do the new test take at the moment and how often do we want to run them? We should take into account that things are usually much faster locally than in CI.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier (https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3145#issuecomment-1580300860) we don't need to address everything as part of this PR. However, I would like to have some of the tests enabled and running as part of the unit tests.

I have also updated the JIRA case to detail some of the decisions this PR includes.\r\n\r\nThere are 9 combinations in `SqlFunctions`, from pairings of `Long`, `BigDecimal` and `Double`. I also added checks for `Infinity` and adjusted the way I calculated overflow for `BigDecimal` and `Double` types. The testing is also more thorough now, which each combination being tested for both normal and overflow behavior.\r\n\r\nIf either of you have time to take another look, please feel free to leave more comments.
