The initial plan (out of many) when I was writing this code was to store the size of each experiment and update it whenever a new file is added to the directory(input and output files) and when a new experiment is being created, gateways call the createExperiment() and updateExperiment() on airavata where I was planning on adding some validations. The validation would involve retrieving the storage used by the user by iterating through all the experiments and getting the experimentDataDirSize and adding them. The total sum would be compared with the StorageQuota specified in the StoragePreference.\r\n\r\nBut now I feel that this might be redundant. The better approach that I feel is for the gateway to calculate the user directory size(Django-Portal has an API for calculating the size of a given directory. Other gateways might need to add an API to retrieve the size of a given directory) and while invoking the createExperiment() or updateExperiment(), send this data. Airavata then compares it with the UserStorageQuota specified in the StoragePreference and throws an exception if the quota is exceeded.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on that, so for now, I'll be closing this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/comments/664908421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/comments/669521641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airavata/pull/258#issuecomment-669521641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/258","id":669521641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTUyMTY0MQ==","user":{"login":"smarru","id":2545482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDU0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2545482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru","html_url":"https://github.com/smarru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-05T21:28:38Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T21:28:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks Marcus for tackling this overdue task, the changes look good to me.

I guess the gateway too can easily achieve these functionalities.\r\n\r\nI did want the validation to happen internally, but the problem I faced was, during the experiment creation phase in Airavata, the experiment model does not have any data related to the StoragePreference in which the experiment is being created. Changing the createExperiment() method to accept another parameter would mean changes across all the gateways. And in my previous discussions with the team, I came to know that in the future, similar to choosing compute preferences for an experiment during the experiment creation phase, we're gonna develop a new functionality where the user gets to choose the StoragePreference in which he/she is going to create the experiment. With that thought process, I created a new API that can be invoked by any gateway, if they choose to use this feature. \r\nBut I just verified that, by calling '_set_storage_id_and_data_dir(experiment)' before creating an experiment, I can set the storageId and experiment data directory removing the need for passing the storageId explicitly.\r\n\r\nBasically, the public API can be changed to an internal API now. Will make those changes soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I did consider this. The problems with this approach are: \r\n   1. We will check the size limit only after the experiment creation is done.\r\n   2. When we know the size limit is exceeded, helix needs to communicate back to APIServer for deleting the created \r\n   experiment entries and if needed, deleting the experiment directory.\r\nConsidering these and after discussing with Dimuthu, I thought this might be the better approach when we use 'StorageResourceAdaptor', but this does seem to complicate things.\r\n\r\nEven if I remove the new public API and integrate it with createExperiment(), this approach would still be consuming APIServer's resources(though we're using pooled resources instead of creating a new SSH connection every time).

By transient network failure I mean some sort of transient network failure between Airavata and the SSH host that prevents the SSH connection from establishing or completing successfully.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/comments/683982167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/comments/705819419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airavata/pull/263#issuecomment-705819419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/263","id":705819419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTgxOTQxOQ==","user":{"login":"DImuthuUpe","id":1346332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDYzMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1346332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe","html_url":"https://github.com/DImuthuUpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DImuthuUpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-08T20:57:54Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T20:57:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is great progress.

That is close to the process I used with the https://github.com/osc/ood_core gem. You could actually do that and copy some of the files over. If you do that, some things you will notice:\r\n\r\n1. the Gemfile won't have any extra dependencies, the gemspec will have them all defined as either dev or runtime dependencies; thrift would become a runtime dependency\r\n2. there is a lib/airavata.rb file that just has the `module Airavata` and a bunch of require statements at the top for all the code under the airavata directory. I think that you can get by with doing `require \"airavata/airavata\"` for requiring the lib/airavata/airavata.rb` file that is generated from your build process\r\n3. you can leave version string in the gemspec or have a version file like the convention used by the scaffolding. I think the benefit of the latter is that when using the gem I can do `Airavata::VERSION` to get the version of the library I'm using programmatically, so that is nice.\r\n4. That means that the gem version needs to [follow semantic versioning ](https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning) and the version string of this gem should change every time you publish a new version. \r\n5. Not sure about providing a link back to the source code for a particular gem. I now realize that with ood_core i'm not actually doing that, though with ood_core the git tags are the almost the same as the version string (`OodCore::VERSION` is `0.14.0` and the github tag is `v0.14.0`. Rails doesn't use homepage but a separate source_code_uri though you could just use homepage - really up to you. But you can see how that works when a gem is a subdirectory of a repo: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v6.0.3.4/activesupport/activesupport.gemspec#L30. \r\nI don't know how you do that with the python sdk but would be curious to know your strategy for linking to the corresponding code in the repo. Would you create a special git tag for the entire airavata repo to reference when the new gem version is created? Or when pushing a new version of the gem, would the version match the version of Airavata itself?\r\n5. You could have the Homepage be the source code directory at the master branch \r\n\r\nMain guides are https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/ and https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/. You have to get accounts on rubygems.org and then if you are the first to push the gem you are the owner and then you can add owners of the gem alongside yourself.\r\n\r\nAfter you are done setting things you, you can test your gem by cd-ing to the directory and running the command `bundle console`. That uses Bundler to \"Start an interactive Ruby console session in the context of the current bundle\".\r\n\r\nA second way to test is to use it in another app. You can have that app's Gemfile specify the `gem \"airavata\", path: \"/path/to/your/gem/dir\"` to load that gem from the file system.\r\n\r\nLet me know how I can help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/comments/714734200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/comments/716707894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airavata/pull/265#issuecomment-716707894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airavata/issues/265","id":716707894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjcwNzg5NA==","user":{"login":"dinukadesilva","id":10680296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjgwMjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10680296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva","html_url":"https://github.com/dinukadesilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinukadesilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-26T17:31:32Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T17:31:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ericfranz
