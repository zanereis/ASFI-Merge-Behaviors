StormSQL should worry less on the SQL expression semantics compared to translating to the Storm physical plan correctly. </p>\n\n<p>I think that it also makes sense to contribute the visitors and the code generators of expressions back to Calcite. The code generators adopts a more passive pattern (e.g., it does not actively pulling data through <tt>Enumerable</tt> compared to the Calcite interpreter) so that it is easier to integrate with Storm.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I think Haohui Mai or maybe someone else from the Storm community should join the Calcite dev list and actively participate.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks for the reminder. I'll subscribe the mailing list.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612598958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/161450293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/897#issuecomment-161450293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/897","id":161450293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTQ1MDI5Mw==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-02T22:12:34Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T22:12:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 Never mind.
