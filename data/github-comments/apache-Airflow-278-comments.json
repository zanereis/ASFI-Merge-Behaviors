I'll do a quick deep dive later today on this. From what you described, my understanding is that basically our problem came from [how we sort the queued tasks when triggering](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/executors/base_executor.py#L159-L162). So when we trigger tasks we always let those upstream tasks to take over the open slots and leave the downstream tasks in the queue_tasks. I think the one-line fix you had is needed logically but I'm not 100% sure if that is solving the root cause for us. In fact the behavior strikes me as expected, since we don'g really set priority on those tasks.\r\n\r\nAll above is my hypothesis, I'll validate when I got a charger for my laptop--docker burns out battery too fast...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/561905372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/561953664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6731#issuecomment-561953664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6731","id":561953664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTk1MzY2NA==","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T03:38:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T03:38:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi

My motivation behind this PR is to keep consistent structure of files within GCP module. Usually system tests exists for operators where the `standard` unit tests are in the `test_<feature_name>_test.py` and system tests are in '`est_<feature_name>_system.py`. As understood this structure, it allows to explicitly seperate different way of testing. When they are divided as I proposed, it is easier to notice that tests from `*_system.py'`probably will be skipped during normal test suite execution and some additional steps are required to run them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/562046669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/562070399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6729#issuecomment-562070399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6729","id":562070399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjA3MDM5OQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T10:32:34Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T10:32:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Hi @TobKed I'm not convinced why we need to have a new file?

Now when we have pytests in place we are going to propose/discuss and implement some ways of re-organising and re-grouping our tests (which pytests is great at).
