In general, the is somewhat simple use case as you can use a uuid generator in a strin gor similar and attempt to push it.   The part where Phoenix isn't great is guaranteeing uniqueness for this rowid on the server, there are hacky solutions I'm aware of to achieve this but due to use of UPSERT and lack of data coming back I think there is some difficulty differentiating a put from a update.  Does this solve/describe the type of use cases you are interested in?  If so I'm thinking a PK constraint as opposed to an actual data type might solve this better.  Thoughts?  Also maybe @tkhurana might chime in as I think he has good knowledge around some of the details of similar use cases. \r\n\r\nNote, for a fixed length type having 0x00 or 0xFF as part of the rowkey should be fine for indexing etc as far as i'm aware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1178358986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1181518834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1458#issuecomment-1181518834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1458","id":1181518834,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5GbIvy","user":{"login":"alejandro-anadon","id":91879124,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXn21A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91879124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon","html_url":"https://github.com/alejandro-anadon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alejandro-anadon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T09:11:47Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T09:11:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi,\r\n\r\nif I may, I will start with the last sentence:\"for a fixed length type having 0x00 or 0xFF as part of the rowkey should be fine for indexing\".\r\n\r\nThis is 100% correct. But the problem is when you want to make an index with a fixed length type that is not part of the rowkey.\r\n\r\nSince it is not part of the rowkey, it can be null.\r\n\r\nAnd there is the need to create a variable length type, PUUIDIndexable (and that can not have neither 0x00 or 0xFF) although when it comes to the truth, it will always have the same length; but it has to be declared as a variable length.\r\n\r\nthis translate is performed in the class \"org.apache.phoenix.util.org.apache.phoenix.util\" in the method \"getIndexColumnDataType\":\r\n\r\n...\r\n    // Since we cannot have nullable fixed length in a row key\r\n    // we need to translate to variable length. The verification that we have a valid index\r\n    // row key was already done, so here we just need to convert from one built-in type to\r\n    // another.\r\n    public static PDataType getIndexColumnDataType(boolean isNullable, PDataType dataType) {\r\n....\r\n\r\nFor example, the INTEGER type is translated to DECIMAL when you want to make an index and it is not PK. look at the following example with the field\r\n\"NOT_IN_PK\".

be the only (but very important) case in which the UUID_INDEXABLE type would be used and it would be at internal level. What would have to be done is not to show (or not to recommend its use) to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing back to the beginning of the comment, in which you say that when you have seen UUIDs used, what is done is to use \"a uuid generator in a string or similar and attempt to push it\".\r\nit is true that it can be done that way.\r\n\r\nBut that can be done with all data types. You can always convert, for example, an integer to String with 'Integer.toString(i)' and do a push.\r\nAnd when retrieved do an 'Integer.parseInt(rs.getString(1))'.\r\n\r\nWhy not do that with integers, doubles, etc.? because:\r\n1) firstly prevents errors of type 'ps.setString(1,Integer.parseInt(\"not a number\"))' making it much safer and with fewer errors than with a 'ps.setInt(1,i)'.\r\n2) it is much more convenient for the programmer not to have to deal with conversions from one type to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question is: Does UUID have enough entity to have its own type? Since this type is being more and more widely used and many databases are implementing it (for example, https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html), in my opinion it does. \r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the use case you are asking about, I have given as an example the use as PK. But there are more interesting use cases.\r\n\r\nSome examples are (text extracted from https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-uuid/ ):\r\n\r\n\t\"[...]Using UUID for a primary key  brings the following advantages:\r\n\r\n    UUID values are unique across tables, databases, and even servers that allow you to merge rows from different databases \r\n\t\tor distribute databases across servers.\r\n    UUID values do not expose the information about your data so they are safer to use in a URL. For example, if a customer \r\n\t\twith id 10 accesses his account via http://www.example.com/customers/10/ URL, it is easy to guess that there is a \r\n\t\tcustomer 11, 12, etc., and this could be a target for an attack.\r\n    UUID values can be generated anywhere that avoid a round trip to the database server. It also simplifies logic in the application. \r\n\t\tFor example, to insert data into a parent table and child tables, you have to insert into the parent table first, \r\n\t\tget generated id and then insert data into the child tables. By using UUID, you can generate the primary key value\r\n\t\tof the parent table up front and insert rows into both parent and child tables at the same time within a transaction.\"\r\n\t\t\r\nOf course it has some cons, but I think the benefits outweigh the cons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part to solve is the possibility of a UUID collision at the moment of its generation and that it coincides with one that is in the database.\r\nin Phoenix.\r\n\r\nIt would be perfect if Phoenix would include something that guarantees that uniqueness when doing the upsert. As you say, to differentiate a \"put\" from an \"update\".\r\nBut that is far from my knowledge. What I can say is that this dilemma occurs with any table that is created in phoenix:\r\n\r\n...\r\n CREATE TABLE DUMMY_WITH_CHAR (ID CHAR(16) NOT NULL, NOT_IN_PK CHAR(16), CONSTRAINT NAME_PK PRIMARY KEY(ID));\r\n...\r\n\r\nIs there any mechanism (except a select prior to the upsert) that when doing an upsert guarantees me that the id does not exist previously? to the best of my knowledge no.\r\n(I guess that's why there is \"upsert\" (insert or update) and not \"insert\" or \"update\").\r\n\r\nReturning to the subject of collisions, while they are mathematically possible, \r\nas well as a possible SHA256 collision used by banks, the chances of collision in UUIDs are close to zero.\r\n\r\nConsidering the scope of use of Phoenix, the consequences of a collision are assumable. I mean:\r\nif I had to create a military, medical or banking system, where the repercussions of a UUID collision would be severe, I would not use Phoenix.\r\nBut if I use Phoenix for systems with huge masses of data (which is its ultimate goal), a remote UUID collision, I would consider it acceptable.\r\nAnd if in the end I decide to use it and a collision is critical, I would do a select prior to upsert.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1181518834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1182496660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1458#issuecomment-1182496660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1458","id":1182496660,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5Ge3eU","user":{"login":"dbwong","id":41923099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTIzMDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41923099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong","html_url":"https://github.com/dbwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbwong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T21:00:57Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T21:00:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for some of the responses.  I think we are talking about the same thing but let me elaborate to be clear.  The UUID type is fixed length.  In order to handle NULL SQL values in 2ndary indexing  the type has to be rewriten to variable length type in order to write NULL.  This necessitated the introduction of the concept of UUID indexable internal type.  It is fine for the fixed width type to contain 0x00 in the ascending or 0xFF in the descending but not allowed in variable length type.  You had an initial approach via disallowing the use of 0x00 (0xFF in desc) initially by modification of the UUID algorithm that you mentioned and thus the idea of not allowing those in the initial type but decided with the Byte[] (UUID) -> Varchar (UUID indexable) approach.  Is this the correct summary?  \r\n\r\nI'm okay with the risk of collision as long as it is documented.

Your summary is correct.\r\n\r\nJust to point out that I also added a UUID ARRAY type, but not a UUID_INDEXABLE ARRAY because I did not see a use case.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a few points:\r\n\r\n1) For the UUIDIndexable I tried to develop an algorithm (more complex than a simple .toString()) to make the UUID more compact.\r\nAnd I succeeded. It stayed at 16 bytes if there was no 0x00 or 0xFF or at 19 bytes if there was any 0x00 or 0xFF. It worked.\r\nBut I had to reject it because it lost the (byte) order within the hbase when it is part of the primary key\r\nmaking the \"select\" with an \"order by\" not work.\r\n\r\nWith the .tosTring() I get that there is neither 0x00 nor 0xFF and also the order is maintained (but it is less compact and perhaps slower).\r\nIf you see fit I can go deeper in the explanation of this algorithm and attach it but I think that having rejected it is not appropriate to do it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Regarding the descending vs ascending problem, I could solve it (or so I think).\r\nIn my first commit I didn't (mistakenly) take into consideration that the keys or indexes could have a DESC; then everything\r\nworked until I started to use the DESC. And I didn't understand why.\r\n\r\nAfter some research (the only \"documentation\" I have of internals os Phoenix is the source code; and I had to do a lot of try and failure)\r\nI realized that in the Hbase, when using DESC, the bytes are inverted.\r\nThat's when I corrected the algorithm so that it would work also when using\r\nwhen using DESC. then I commited the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) There is something I may be doing wrong:.\r\n\r\nin the method  org.apache.phoenix.expression.function.StringToUUIDFunction.evaluate(Tuple tuple, ImmutableBytesWritable ptr)\r\nI am doing this check:\r\n\"\r\n\t\t String value;\r\n        if (ptr.get()[ptr.getOffset() + 8] == '-') {\r\n            value =new String(ptr.get(), ptr.getOffset(), UUID_TEXTUAL_LENGTH,Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"));\r\n        } else {\r\n            byte[] temp =SortOrder.invert(ptr.get(), ptr.getOffset(), new byte[36], 0, UUID_TEXTUAL_LENGTH);\r\n            value = new String(temp, Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"));\r\n        }\r\n\"\r\n\r\nWhy this   \" == '-' \" check??\r\nbecause when writing the tests, in the test org.apache.phoenix.expression.function.UUIDFunctionTest.testUUIDFuntions() I have two checks:\r\nA) to watch over the ASC\r\n        UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();\r\n        String uuidStr = testUUIDToStringFunction(uuid, null, SortOrder.ASC);\r\n        UUID returnUUid = testStringToUUIDfunction(uuidStr, null, SortOrder.ASC);\r\n        assertTrue(uuid.equals(returnUUid));\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nB) to watch over the DESC:\r\n         uuid =UUID.randomUUID();\r\n         uuidStr = testUUIDToStringFunction(uuid, null, SortOrder.DESC);\r\n         returnUUid = testStringToUUIDfunction(uuidStr, null, SortOrder.DESC);\r\n         assertTrue(returnUUid.equals(UUID.fromString(uuidStr)));\r\n\r\nWhen it is ASC, there is no problem, but in DESC, if I don't make that check (in StringToUUIDFunction), and I use directly what is in 'ptr'\r\nit gives error because the bytes are inverted and I have to invert them again.\r\n\r\nIf I don't make the StringToUUIDFunction check of \" == '-' \" and use directly what is in the ptr, all the other\r\n tests (disabling the DESC test in testUUIDFuntions) work correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that what is happening  is that I have badly designed the DESC test in UUIDFunctionTest\r\nand  I am \"adapting\" the function StringToUUIDFunction only for that test and that in real life\r\nit would never happen that: that StringToUUIDFunction never arrives the 'ptr' with the inverted bytes.\r\n\r\nI think that in order for that to happen, there should be someting like:\r\nselect STR_TO_UUID('uuid-string-with-bytes-inverted');\r\nAnd that makes no sense.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think? Should I remove the StringToUUIDFunction validation of \" == '-' \" and remove the DESC test?\r\nCan it be that the DESC test in UUIDFunctionTest is badly designed?\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Is this logic correct ?

two open issues:\r\n\r\n1. The new litarals don't work with BINARY ARRAYS. I suspect that this is not a new problem, so I'm not terribly concerned about that. This may be related to the fact the parser generates an ARRAY of VARBINARY nodes, which is not a supported\r\n\r\n2. The way we convert binaries to strings is inconsitent:\r\nOn one hand, we have the Formatters that are used for VARBINARY (and now BINARY) results, on the other we have the toStringLiteral() method in the P*BBinary classes, which are used for Statement.toString(), and for BINARY_ARRAY (which doesn't have an explicit Formatter set)\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, the formatter generated  _'AABB'_, which the toStringLiteral() methods returned _'[170, 187]'_\r\n\r\nWith my patch, the formatter is the same, only it's now also set for BINARY, while previously it was only set for VARBINARY.\r\nI've changed the toStringLiteral() formatter to return a valid binary string literal, _X'AABB'_ , so now stmt.toString() generates valid SQL. \r\n\r\nAs BINARY_ARRAY doesn't have a formatter, it uses the toStringLiteral() format, this is not changed by the patch.\r\n\r\nThe complicate things, it seems that Oracle and Mysql simply returns something like new String(byte[]) for getString(), so the Phoenix behaviour is unique.\r\n\r\nI don't think that this is show-stopper either, the patch doesn't make any of those problems any worse.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1228096196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1228182951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1482#issuecomment-1228182951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1482","id":1228182951,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5JNJWn","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-26T08:02:08Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:02:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"-1\r\nThe
