We can be much smarter about this whole thing, IMO.\n\nWhat do you think of\n- Backoff 2x as before\n- Limit the backoff only to cases where the connection timed out. Losing connectivity should mean total, fast failure in many cases, and we could detect the difference between these cases. In the case of server error or no connectivity, that error should bubble immediately and the application can decide what to do (either sleep, back off, or hook into the connectivity notification APIs that are cropping up in modern browsers)\n- Add a random jitter to the back-off. When timeouts are happening because the server is overwhelmed it could help to prevent clients from stampeding. Such a jitter is a classic feature of backoffs like this.\n\nFinally, I haven't looked at this code in a while, but we should be sure that the whole thing is cancellable by the application in case the backoff gets large.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/18081144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/18099247","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/60#issuecomment-18099247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/60","id":18099247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDk5MjQ3","user":{"login":"andrewspode","id":3798527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3798527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewspode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-18T11:25:25Z","updated_at":"2013-05-18T11:25:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Agreed.

As is, though, I'm ambivalent about what is the better default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/18782084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/18830711","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/60#issuecomment-18830711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/60","id":18830711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODMwNzEx","user":{"login":"andrewspode","id":3798527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3798527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewspode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewspode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-03T09:36:17Z","updated_at":"2013-06-03T09:36:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've been working on the code as I develop my project at the moment.

@deathbearbrown \n\nI've been trying this out on, I really like what you have done here but we need to extend this a little further. Currently the loader only gets displayed after the Route Object has finished its establish(). Which means that there is still a lengthy period when the screen is just blank. I think we need to add `disableLoader` and `loaderClassname` to the RouteObject and then just after Line 256, in that `if` statement, add `$('#dashboard').addClass(routeObject.loaderClassname)`.\nI did a quick hack of that and it makes it quite a bit better as it then has a loader on the screen straight away. Obviously that loader has to be removed before we start displaying the view loaders. Would also like to know what \n@chewbranca thinks of this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/19095438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/19118794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/63#issuecomment-19118794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/63","id":19118794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTE4Nzk0","user":{"login":"deathbearbrown","id":607541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/607541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/deathbearbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-07T16:48:17Z","updated_at":"2013-06-07T16:48:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey, I added an update to include the extra loader.

Why not give the admin a choice?\n\n@isaacs I agree in an npm-style app you'd prefer whitelisting to ensure you're not leaking. The original code was a blacklist approach, so that's why I added it as an option.\n\n@benoitc I don't think we are adding a lot of complexity by supporting both. The blacklist means that as a server admin, you can be sure that the important couchdb fields are protected against information leaks, even if users decide, or are allowed, to add their own properties to their _user docs as part of an app that applies only to a specific db.\n\nIf the white/blacklist is not directly specified, we use a default config and therefore as devs we are able to keep this current within a specific release, and in a way that we can control when packaging.\n\nOverall I am +1 on whitelisting, and pulling in a default config that's wired into the code for safety. I'm +0 on supporting both options, so let's wrap this up & get it in whichever way we go.\n\n I'll do some doc notes to go with it, @indutny could you add a test perhaps?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/19803348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/19804766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/67#issuecomment-19804766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/67","id":19804766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODA0NzY2","user":{"login":"benoitc","id":14498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc","html_url":"https://github.com/benoitc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benoitc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-21T08:51:43Z","updated_at":"2013-06-21T08:51:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dch as an admin you can't be sure that blacklisting will always work when you upgrade couchdb except if we make the promise to not add sensitive fields on update.
