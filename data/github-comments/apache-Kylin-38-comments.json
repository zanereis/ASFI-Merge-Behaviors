如何启动一个集群\r\n\r\n进入docker 目录：\r\n```shell script\r\ncd apachekylin/kylin/docker\r\n```\r\n\r\n执行如下命令可以 构建docker镜像，并启动docker-compose\r\n```shell script\r\nsh setup_cluster.sh --cluster_mode write-read --hadoop_version 2.8.5 --hive_version 1.2.2 --enable_hbase yes --hbase_version 1.1.2  --enable_ldap no  \r\n```\r\n\r\n1. --cluster_mode 参数值可选项为[write,write-read]默认参数是 write，也就是会启动一个写集群，不做读写分离 \\\r\n    在write 模式下会启动一个 hadoop集群包含hive，hbase，等。在write-read模式下会启动两个hadoop集群，一个作为计算集群，一个作为查询集群，并且hbase装在查询集群中\r\n2. --hadoop_version 可以指定hadoop的版本，默认是 2.8.5 \\\r\n    hadoop 集群包含 1个 namenode节点和3个datanode节点，以及1个resourcemanager和2个nodemanager，以及一个jobhistoryserver。\r\n3. --hive_version 可以指定hive版本，默认是 1.2.2 \\\r\n    hive 包含一个 hivemetastore 和一个 hiveserver2 节点\r\n4. --hbase_version 可以指定hbase版本，默认是 1.1.2\r\n5. --enable_hbase 是否启动habase服务，可选参数为[yes,no], 默认参数是yes \\\r\n    hbase 包含一个 hmaster 和两个 regionserver\r\n6. --enable_ldap 是否启动ldap服务，可选参数为[yes,no], 默认参数是no\r\n7. --enable_kafka 是否启动kafka broker，可选参数为[yes,no], 默认参数是no\r\n8. --enable_kerberos 是否启动 kerberos 服务，可选参数为[yes,no], 默认参数是no。(目前尚为开发完成)\r\n\r\n另外会启动一个kylin集群，包含一个all节点一个job节点和一个query节点。三个节点的kylin目录与 docker-compose/others/kylin/ 一一对应\r\n其中。一般将打包好的kylin jar包解压到 对应的路径下，并修改相应的配置文件，即可实现部署和修改kylin配置的目的。\r\n\r\n如果是第一次执行以上命令，那么会首先去构建和拉取相应的docker镜像，所以执行时间会很长，一般会在半个小时左右才能完成。\r\n\r\n脚本执行完成后可以执行如下命令查询集群状态：\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ndocker ps -a\r\n```\r\n\r\n等待所有的container都达到health状态即可执行kylin的测试工作。\r\n\r\n\r\n关闭集群：\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsh stop_cluster.sh --cluster_mode write-read --hadoop_version 2.8.5 --hive_version 1.2.2 --enable_hbase yes --hbase_version 1.1.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 注意事项：\r\n\r\n1.\r\n如果想要单独启动或者关闭 docker-compose 而不是使用setup/stop脚本 \r\n那么在启动之前请先构建想需要的image，并设置 image相关的环境变量\r\n\r\n```shell script\r\n\r\nexport HBASE_VERSION=1.1.2\r\nexport HADOOP_VERSION=2.8.4\r\nexport HIVE_VERSION=1.2.2\r\n\r\nexport HADOOP_NAMENODE_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hadoop-base:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\nexport HADOOP_DATANODE_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hadoop-datanode:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\nexport HADOOP_NAMENODE_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hadoop-namenode:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\nexport HADOOP_RESOURCEMANAGER_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hadoop-resourcemanager:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\nexport HADOOP_NODEMANAGER_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hadoop-nodemanager:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\nexport HADOOP_HISTORYSERVER_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hadoop-historyserver:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\nexport HIVE_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hive:hive_${HIVE_VERSION}_hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}\r\n\r\nexport HBASE_MASTER_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hbase-base:hbase_${HBASE_VERSION}\r\nexport HBASE_MASTER_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hbase-master:hbase_${HBASE_VERSION}\r\nexport HBASE_REGIONSERVER_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-hbase-regionserver:hbase_${HBASE_VERSION}\r\n\r\nexport KAFKA_IMAGE=bitnami/kafka:2.0.0\r\nexport LDAP_IMAGE=osixia/openldap:1.3.0\r\nexport CLIENT_IMAGETAG=apachekylin/kylin-client:hadoop_${HADOOP_VERSION}_hive_${HIVE_VERSION}_hbase_${HBASE_VERSION}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n因为 docker-compose 文件中的 image 都是使用环境变量的方式，所以如果想要设置不同版本 image \r\n可以通过设置环境变量的方式来启动不同版本的 container。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/699629940/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/699649948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1429#issuecomment-699649948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1429","id":699649948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5OTY0OTk0OA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-27T15:32:37Z","updated_at":"2020-09-27T15:32:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
