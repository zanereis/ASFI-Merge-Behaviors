My only remaining concern is our forward-compatibility guarantee that older readers will continue to be able to read tables written by future versions within the format version in metadata.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this breaks that guarantee for tables that are appended to using manifests. I think that means we should test that older readers can read tables written with this that don't have appended manifests (I think Avro will throw a runtime error if it encounters a null snapshot ID, but will allow attempting to read). We should also probably add a feature flag to turn on this breaking behavior -- that way you can opt into using manifest files without a snapshot ID, knowing that it will break older readers.

I 'm trying to understand this, please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `ParquetFilter@predicate`  uses binary column predicate for decimal while decimal can be stored as int or long type in parquet. So we need to translate the reference to int or long as following: \r\n```java\r\n        case DECIMAL:\r\n          Type.PrimitiveType type = ref.type().asPrimitiveType();\r\n          if (type instanceof Types.DecimalType) {\r\n            int precision = ((Types.DecimalType)type).precision();\r\n            if (precision <= DECIMAL_INT32_MAX_DIGITS) {\r\n              return pred(op, FilterApi.intColumn(path), getParquetPrimitive(lit));\r\n            }\r\n            else if (precision <= DECIMAL_INT64_MAX_DIGITS) {\r\n              return pred(op, FilterApi.longColumn(path), getParquetPrimitive(lit));\r\n            } else {\r\n              return pred(op, FilterApi.binaryColumn(path), getParquetPrimitive(lit));\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n          return pred(op, FilterApi.binaryColumn(path), getParquetPrimitive(lit));\r\n```\r\nSince DecimalLiteral uses a default comparator (null first + natural order), so it cannot compare the BigDecimal that stored as binary. So we need to define a customized comparator such as `BinaryDecimalComparator` and use it in `DecimalLiteral#comparator()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/574006063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/574049574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/734#issuecomment-574049574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/734","id":574049574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDA0OTU3NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T07:53:40Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T07:53:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alexey-fin, do you mean [this bug](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-18743)?\r\n\r\n@alexey-fin, could you point to code in HMS that triggers a recursive scan on alter table?

Then people can roll back if 1.11.0 is problematic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/574448001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/574454792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/735#issuecomment-574454792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/735","id":574454792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDQ1NDc5Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T01:35:34Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T01:35:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @rdsr!

You can convert the Avro Schema object to a string and then parse it with the shaded Avro api in Iceberg, but then u risk these internal apis changing underneath you with future versions of Iceberg.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/575258363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/575329875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/684#issuecomment-575329875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/684","id":575329875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTMyOTg3NQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-16T20:22:07Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T20:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chenjunjiedada, I think I was wrong about this issue. I was referring to the note here, where we are converting Iceberg filters to Parquet filters: https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/ParquetFilters.java#L207\r\n\r\nBut that code path is only used when reading Parquet files with a Parquet `ReadSupport`. We don't do that for Spark, we use [the Iceberg reader](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/Parquet.java#L231-L233) now to avoid the overhead of `ReadSupport` and to implement our own row group filters (that support, for example, Decimal and IN).\r\n\r\nThe new read path already has support for decimal because it [converts Parquet min/max stats](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/ParquetMetricsRowGroupFilter.java#L104) to the objects that Iceberg uses. That [conversion supports decimal](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/ParquetConversions.java#L71).\r\n\r\nSo the new read path that we actually use already supports decimal predicates. We could go back and fix the old read path, but I don't think that we want to spend the effort since the problem is knowing what physical type to pass to Parquet (int, long, or binary).\r\n\r\nI think we should mark this issue completed.

That's the one that @maqroll correctly pointed to. But we now use the new read path and the row group filters are [`ParquetMetricsRowGroupFilter`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/ParquetMetricsRowGroupFilter.java) and [`ParquetDictionaryRowGroupFilter`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/parquet/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/parquet/ParquetDictionaryRowGroupFilter.java). We needed to add support to those classes for the `startsWith` predicate added by #327, which was done by @aokolnychyi in #398.\r\n\r\nI think the only remaining task for this (and for IN/NOT_IN) is to update the conversion from Spark filters to use the new Iceberg expressions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/575734167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/575735179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/682#issuecomment-575735179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/682","id":575735179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTczNTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-17T18:10:37Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T18:10:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to close this one since I think it covers a case that we don't really need to worry about.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/575735179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/575964753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/721#issuecomment-575964753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/721","id":575964753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTk2NDc1Mw==","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-19T03:59:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T03:59:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks all for the feedback, sorry for late response.
