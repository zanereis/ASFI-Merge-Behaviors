Your idea can work if we have a paragraph defining HTML element.

(what happen i import the same note again?)\n\n> > > Allow me to disagree with this idea, if there are 10 paragraphs in the note with 10 different interpreters, it will create a lot of pollution. There is no reason that we push the Angular variable to many interpreters that are not used by the target paragraph(s).\n> > > \n> > > Another argument against binding the variable to all interpreters used by the note is because Angular variables are persisted in note.json file so we'll create a lot of data that will be exported/re-imported and not used ....\n> > \n> > Right, that's what i wanted to say actually :-)\n> \n> So there is no problem, we both agree that z.angularBind() should bind value to only one paragraph right ?\n\nAnd only one interpreter.\n\n> So to conclude, we indeed agree on many things. I propose the following next steps:\n> \n> Rework this PR to remove runParagraph so we decouple z.angularBind() and z.runParagrap()\n> Create another PR to keep the original paragraph id every time we import a note, based on the patch I showed\n\nSounds reasonable.

It also means the interpreter will properly display html created by R packages in the manner the user expects. \n\nWhile I'm somewhat open on this issue as well, I'm pretty sure that the current design is the one that R users will find the most natural. \n\n> On Mar 10, 2016, at 3:59 PM, Jeff Steinmetz notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> This doesn't work as I would expect:\n> \n> %r\n> print(\"%html <h1>HTML Works</h1>\")\n> and %table, %md, etc\n> Shouldn't this work similar to other interpreters, and support the zeppelin display system?\n> \n> this returns rendered html in pyspark\n> \n> %pyspark\n> \n> print(\"%html <h1>HTML Works</h1>\")\n> as does\n> \n> %spark\n> \n> print(\"%html <h1>HTML Works</h1>\")\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/195053667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/195054465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-195054465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":195054465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTA1NDQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"elbamos","id":10103420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTAzNDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10103420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos","html_url":"https://github.com/elbamos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elbamos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-10T21:20:16Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T21:20:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The R coding style standard is that variables defined by a package are prefixed with a '.'

This is why the magic isn't working as you expect-R is adding formatting. If you write the string with cat() instead of print, it should work, and I'll fix if it doesn't.\n\nHowever, in R, html is generally created using the 'html' class. If an object of class 'html' is returned by this interpreter, it is passed to Zeppelin with the %html magic for native display. \n\nThis is necessary to handle some kinds of interactive visualization. It also means the interpreter will properly display html created by R packages in the manner the user expects. \n\nWhile I'm somewhat open on this issue as well, I'm pretty sure that the current design is the one that R users will find the most natural. \n\n> On Mar 10, 2016, at 3:59 PM, Jeff Steinmetz notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> This doesn't work as I would expect:\n> \n> %r\n> print(\"%html <h1>HTML Works</h1>\")\n> and %table, %md, etc\n> Shouldn't this work similar to other interpreters, and support the zeppelin display system?\n> \n> this returns rendered html in pyspark\n> \n> %pyspark\n> \n> print(\"%html <h1>HTML Works</h1>\")\n> as does\n> \n> %spark\n> \n> print(\"%html <h1>HTML Works</h1>\")\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/195084517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
