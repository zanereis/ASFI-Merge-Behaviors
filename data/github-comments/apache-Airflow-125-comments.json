The test grabs the content from the command line and uses regex to extract the required information.\r\n```python\r\n    def test_cli_connections_list(self):\r\n        with mock.patch('sys.stdout',\r\n                        new_callable=six.StringIO) as mock_stdout:\r\n            cli.connections(self.parser.parse_args(['connections', '--list']))\r\n            stdout = mock_stdout.getvalue()\r\n        conns = [[x.strip(\"'\") for x in re.findall(\"'\\w+'\", line)[:2]]\r\n                 for ii, line in enumerate(stdout.split('\\n'))\r\n                 if ii % 2 == 1]\r\n        conns = [conn for conn in conns if len(conn) > 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the command line strips longer names and presents it as `...`, so instead of `google_cloud_platform` it may show `google...platform...` and instead of `druid_ingest_default` it would end of showing `druid_..._default` (Screenshot 2). Hence the regex won't be able to match it when the space in cli is low and it displays `...` instead of correct names.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot 1:** \r\nTravis CI report ([link](https://travis-ci.org/kaxil/incubator-airflow/jobs/345754777#L5102)) showing that because of the dots, the connection list obtained using regex only contain `[u'bigquery_default']` instead of `[u'bigquery_default', u'google_cloud_platform']` and similar with `druid`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/36635866-694f20dc-19e2-11e8-9646-5bee210cec4d.png)\r\n\r\n**Screenshot 2:** \r\nThe screengrab obtained from command line when the connections are listed. You can check using `airflow connections -l`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/36636001-a4ef3bbc-19e3-11e8-9eff-68d4ec894c64.png)\r\n\r\nHence, I have removed the below line from the test as the main purpose of this test was to assert that some of the connections present in the output are as expected which is already done where the connection name and connection types have short string length.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nself.assertIn(['bigquery_default', 'google_cloud_platform'], conns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Travis CI has now passed..
