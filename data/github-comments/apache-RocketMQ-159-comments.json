）导致的。\r\n3、这里的offset上报和定时任务上报还没关系，是消费者在JVM退出时，下面截图这两步没有严格严程序逻辑走。\r\n4、5.0应该是一样的可以复现，而且还比较容易复现，像我上面有截图的例子。\r\nawaitTerminateMillis默认配置为0，默认配置应该不能给0。自己本地200后可以控制下面两个步骤按顺序执行，就不存在成倍重复的问题了。\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/assets/30384521/8c49c2f0-2ee3-4b61-81d3-74b92a296bef)\r\n\r\n这个问题我们生产环境已出了这样的故障。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1686327172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1687551306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/7198#issuecomment-1687551306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7198","id":1687551306,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85klf1K","user":{"login":"john1337","id":11956341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTU2MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11956341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337","html_url":"https://github.com/john1337","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john1337/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T06:37:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T06:37:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"已解决，https://blog.csdn.net/john1337/article/details/132412838","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1687551306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1687684538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/7220#issuecomment-1687684538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7220","id":1687684538,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85kmAW6","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-22T08:06:22Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T08:06:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

我遇到过，不过我是5.0版本。 我理解是第一条消息发送时由于topic没有创建，所以第一条消息去触发了topic的创建（其实是consume queue的初始化）然后由于topic还没有创建（在消息被broker接收到时）所以消息发送失败了（write consume queue fail），所以在这里应该加一个重试，我原本打算debug一下这块的细节，不过还没来得及做。 不过丢失了第一条消息确实是一个已知的问题。\r\n\r\n感谢，我测试了 5.0.0 和 5.1.3 都是有这个问题。而且如果是 mq 集群时，这个问题更让人头疼，单机时至少发第二次能够发出去，但是集群时如果正好创建了 topic 的 broker 宕机，那么后续再发消息其他的 broker 不会再自动创建
