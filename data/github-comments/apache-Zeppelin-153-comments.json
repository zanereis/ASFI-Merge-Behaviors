This is not a problem that can be fixed with this PR. It's time to that we should take care of overall selenium test. \r\n\r\nhere is one thought in my head to quickly resolve issue, how about spliting the 3rd job in Travis?

addition. Thank you.\r\nBtw, `renew_lifetime` although can be set in `krb5.conf`, it's maximum value is limited on Active Directory side if AD is used for Kerberos, look for example [Kerberos Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc757692(v=ws.10).aspx#w2k3tr_sepol_accou_set_hpjo) .\r\nMight be worth adding to the documentation?\r\n\r\n> A user whoever configures Zeppelin with this configuration i.e. have a keytab/principal configured and enable \"user impersonation\", is aware that this keytab file is being shared with various users (which is not the default interpreter setting that we ship with Zeppelin), and if (s)he doesn't want this behaviour they can always fall back to the default option (which is not configuring any).\r\n\r\nWould be great if Zeppelin would launch user's own Zeppelin interpreter processes under their own uid through setuid() call. So then keytabs could be locked down to be accessible to that one user. For example, after I LDAP-authenticated as \"tagar\" user, Zeppelin will drop down uid to tagar user and its keytab will have unix access bits set to `0600`. Makes sense? This probably should be part of another jira though.

So, to explain what's happening you'd need one table for shared/scoped/isolated for the 'per user' mode and another table again for shared/scoped/isolated for the 'per note' mode.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to have a column or table explaining how data can be shared, or not, between notebooks in the 3 different modes. As a Zeppelin user I find all these different combinations really confusing. Maybe an architectural diagram of how the different parts of Zeppelin talk to each other would help here. Or maybe the product itself should be simplified to remove a lot of these combinations, especially if they're not used much?!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/311593760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/311593966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2407#issuecomment-311593966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2407","id":311593966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTU5Mzk2Ng==","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T08:33:53Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T08:33:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Tagar sure, would you like to create a JIRA for the same?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/311593966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/311612626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2446#issuecomment-311612626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2446","id":311612626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTYxMjYyNg==","user":{"login":"necosta","id":26248959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjQ4OTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26248959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta","html_url":"https://github.com/necosta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/necosta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T09:52:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T09:52:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@1ambda , yes, started adding unit-tests.
