Why would you need to change all operator code (airflow.operator.*) to change its logger? It will inherit it from TaskInstance (I think), if not you could use \"propagate = True\" in the logging config and set \"airflow.operators\". Or add an extra method called something like \"setTaskInstance\" to TaskHandler, as they operators will inherit the parent logger. Obviously we need to try this out. I wouldn't necessarily call it critical as these kind of changes could be acceptable.\r\n\r\n2. I think you would need to grab the template from the configuration and not do it in TaskHandler 'fixed'. Arguments from the config are password as keyword arguments to the constructor of the Handler. https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema\r\n\r\n3. I don't think that really matters. You can just iterate over logging.handlers and see if one exposes the ReadMixin (or read method) and you are fine: they are logging all the same information. You could also make this a configuration item in airflow.cfg, i.e. Handler to use to read the logs.\r\n\r\nI would use the flush method for uploading (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L770), but that's arguable.\r\n\r\nI think you don't you need to close the handlers by hand, I presume these are closed on interpreter shutdown.

Operators (at least majority) uses **root logger** like `logging.info` instead of logging into a specific logger. How can it be changed to use 'airflow.task' logger for all operators?\r\n2. Would you be able to provide a concrete example? Given a task_instnace, how can we provide this task instance context when we use `dictConfig(CONFIG)` to instantiate handler and get the logger.\r\n3. Why does it not matter? If webserver only grabs a random one and call the read method, it won't return the correct log unless user only configures one handler with the `read` method. But I guess we could make user specify in `airflow.cfg` the name of the handler. \r\n\r\nMax and I discussed using the configuration style today. This configuration is ultimately static and doesn't provide enough context when instantiating the handler (unless the second point is addressed). Ideally, we can use a log handler generator that returns a callable handler. It can then be instantiated during run time with task instance and other contexts as arguments. Then config dictionary would not be used in this design but might be used in each handler's implementation. I will sketch this new design out soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/315194144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/315196374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2441#issuecomment-315196374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2441","id":315196374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTE5NjM3NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T20:43:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T20:43:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2441](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/38c86bbbcbc85ec470f31a33f2a480ea45510a45?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.03%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441/graphs/tree.svg?src=pr&width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #2441      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   69.31%   69.28%   -0.04%     \n==========================================\n  Files         146      146              \n  Lines       11244    11244              \n==========================================\n- Hits         7794     7790       -4     \n- Misses       3450     3454       +4\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/bin/cli.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9iaW4vY2xpLnB5) | `51.86% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `75.05% <0%> (-0.41%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2441?src=pr&el=footer).

The python core libs provide some inspiration: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L907\r\n\r\nWhat I would do is something like (high level pseudo code):\r\n```\r\n\r\ndef __init__(xxx, template=None):\r\n   self.template = template\r\n   self.file_handle = None\r\n \r\ndef _open(dag_id, execution_date, task_id):\r\n  file_name = self.template.format(dag_id, execution_date, task_id)\r\n  self.file_handle = open(file_name)\r\n\r\ndef emit():\r\n  if not self.file_handle:\r\n    open(...)\r\n\r\n  write(self.file_handle, xxx)\r\n\r\ndef close():\r\n  if self.file_handle:\r\n    self.file_handle.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou probably want to add a check if you are a still logging for the same dag_id,execution_date, task_id, but I think you get the point.\r\n\r\n3. It isn't random. Just just goes through the handlers and tries to find one that exposes the \"read\" method. Indeed if that doesn't exist it won't do anything, but we help the user by providing sensible defaults. Buy using airflow.cfg seems more practical (or maybe add it to the LoggingConfig dict which puts all logging config in one place).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/315201344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/315203146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2407#issuecomment-315203146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2407","id":315203146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTIwMzE0Ng==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T21:09:44Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T21:09:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yk5 will try to get this reviewed today.

I tested locally and it's working. Just want to get some comments before moving on.\r\n\r\nHere are several TODOs mentioned in the solution:\r\n1. Use `airflow.task` logger to collect all task related logs. Currently, it overwrites root logger but I am wondering if we can redirect other loggers like `airflow.task_runner.bash_task_runner.BashTaskRunner` to this logger.\r\n2. Airflow has many places trying to setup logging, including `airflow.cfg`, `setting.py configure_logging`, `cli.py setup_logging`.

I do not know why you think this makes logging messier @aoen? A (merged) design doc on the wiki would indeed highly appreciated. I'll overthink it over the weekend a bit more.\r\n\r\n@AllisonWang on your remarks a couple of ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Logging works hierarchal and it returns a reference to same handler if it already exists. So if we can make `airflow.task_runner` a child of `airflow.task`, ie. `airflow.task.task_runner` you are good to go. (Just an idea)\r\n2. Yes, but the full refactor doesn't necessarily need to be part of your PR. Your PR lays down the blueprint to which we can move over (imho). Obviously, a full refactor is preferred but still might need to be split it in several PRs to reduce the complexity.\r\n3. Yes. I do prefer a `airflow.utils.log.TaskFileHandler` instead of a `AirflowTaskHandler`, the latter is ambiguous and also double named `airflow.logging.AirflowTaskHandler`? I don't think we really need the `airflow.logging` package as we probably won't add to many thing there.

Although I am seeing mixups in hooks & operator at some places in current code.\r\n\r\n> It would be nice to just be able to switch hooks (ftp->sftp) and have the same interface/functionality. In my case I need other features needed by the ftp hook for SFTP.\r\n\r\nSure, that would be good flexibility to have, but Paramiko is all about secure connections using ssh trasport, and dont support ftp or ftp over SSL/TLS. Although since it provides most of standard ftp functions in its sftp implementation ( ex: getCWD() ), we can create wrapper functions in SFTPOperator, if the compatibility and easy switching between ftp and sftp is needed. That would be a separate change though and out of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/315866979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/315876869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2422#issuecomment-315876869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2422","id":315876869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTg3Njg2OQ==","user":{"login":"allisonwang","id":5182499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5182499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T20:42:26Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T20:42:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin Make sense to me. Both jobs and task runner uses LoggingMixin which returns logger with format `module_name.class_name`. We can set `propagate = True` to make logs go through parent log handlers. Setting up context for task_runner is easy but for jobs, we don't have a TI object to pass in the handlers. Actually, do we even want to display the logs from `models.py` or `jobs.py` to UI? Airflow users are more concerned about everything happening inside `task_runner` while other logs are mainly for debugging airflow itself. Can we maybe have a separate handler for those system logs?

If we are able to run within max_dag_runs limits we should be able to run the whole backfill in one go, just a little bit slower: if a dag run finished a new slot becomes available, backfills wait till all runs finish so *most likely* they will get a slot except when the scheduler runs a new dag run. So what is the expected behavior? Do we wait till a slot becomes available (timeout needed?)? Do we expect the user to issue another backfill (might be confusing to the user).\r\n\r\nIn addition, as this is a huge PR, please stay in scope and don't fix details outside its scope (no changes to dagrun_exists, logging fixes etc).

So what is the expected behavior? Do we wait till a slot becomes available (timeout needed?)? Do we expect the user to issue another backfill (might be confusing to the user).\r\n\r\nAll these are interesting questions, but I think they're out of scope of this PR - since these changes only try to enforce the `max_active_runs` limit correctly within a `BackfillJob`.\r\n\r\nIMO any wait/retry logic should be made external to the `BackfillJob`, e.g. in the CLI running BackfillJobs for the same date interval or providing the user with `--tries` param or something alike. Including wait/retry logic within `BackfillJob` would only make it more complex and harder to maintain, test and debug.\r\n\r\nBackfill is already a manual adhoc process run in the CLI, so as long as proper logging is provided to the user, they should be already aware of the `max_active_runs` limit, so providing some parameter which helps them decide how long to wait could be a good solution.\r\n\r\nAs of now, with this PR, the user would see that not all dag runs were able to run since the limit has been reached, and she's advised to re-run the backfill job.\r\n\r\n> In addition, as this is a huge PR, please stay in scope and don't fix details outside its scope (no changes to dagrun_exists, logging fixes etc). This makes it harder it rollback if required, besides you could introduce bugs that are unrelated.\r\n>\r\n> I prefer a PR that splits the refactor and the new functionality - again easier to review also considering the above remarks (and agreeing with @aoen) and easier to rollback if required.\r\n\r\nAgreed, I've changed the branch to include two commits now:\r\n- the first with no logic changes and just the refactor of the code within `BackfillJob._execute` to functions within the same class. Refactor is within scope as it only modifies parts of the previous `_execute` method and only touches `{airflow,tests}/jobs.py`\r\n- the second with the change in logic to restrict dag runs in backfill job to the `max_active_runs` limit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/316168325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/316209448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2457#issuecomment-316209448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2457","id":316209448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjIwOTQ0OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T21:53:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T21:53:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2457](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/751e936ac2d18aec0315d2ed4f307c6b04ea431e?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457/graphs/tree.svg?token=WdLKlKHOAU&src=pr&height=150&width=650)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #2457      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage    69.4%   69.42%   +0.02%     \n==========================================\n  Files         146      146              \n  Lines       11289    11297       +8     \n==========================================\n+ Hits         7835     7843       +8     \n  Misses       3454     3454\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `87.27% <100%> (+0.03%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `76.37% <100%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2457?src=pr&el=footer).

I imagine when the #2414 is ready this becomes less useful for people who use k8s executor as they will be able to run docker containers directly.
