#644).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/542433241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/542443889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/588#issuecomment-542443889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/588","id":542443889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjQ0Mzg4OQ==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T23:18:34Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T23:18:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"==>
