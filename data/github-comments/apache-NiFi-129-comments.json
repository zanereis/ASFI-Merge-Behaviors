Matt, the code all seems to make sense but when I tested it out with a simple `GFF` -> `QueryRecord` -> `LogAttribute` flow, I get an error enabling the `ScriptedReader` (using the same script you provide for testing) which doesn't block enabling the `QR` processor, which I thought was the whole point of the PR? Hopefully I'm just doing something wrong? I've attached the flow definition as it exists. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n<flowController encoding-version=\"1.4\">\r\n

A couple of comments from my review.\r\n> \r\n> It looks like the path property allows the nifi admin to set which paths the should use the larger limits. And these limits are set per context path. Is this too broad? Should the configurable paths be more specific since there are some endpoints that expect potential large payloads? It's probably ok if not initially as I can appreciate the motivation here. The nifi admin can just ensure that the large value is enough to cover those potential larges payloads.\r\n> \r\n> What are your thoughts on configuring the `DoSFilter` in `JettyServer` as well? My only concern would be maintainability of the codebase going forward and whether folks would know to find that configuration in the future in the `webdefault.xml`.\r\n\r\nthanks for the thoughtful feedback @mcgilman \r\n\r\ni had the two filters in different spots because that was the first way i could get them to function properly.  based on your feedback, i've put them both in the jetty server class and removed the xml parts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/602071371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/602097123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4104#issuecomment-602097123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4104","id":602097123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjA5NzEyMw==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-21T20:08:15Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T20:08:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 could you take a look at the precision part and give me your opinion?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/602097123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/602161276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4104#issuecomment-602161276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4104","id":602161276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjE2MTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"Xeinn","id":21983868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTgzODY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21983868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn","html_url":"https://github.com/Xeinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xeinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-22T07:48:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-22T07:48:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@MikeThomsen \r\nHi Mike,\r\n\r\nHad a quick look at the unit tests and can see what you mean.  Recall having a bit of debate with myself over how to handle this when initially implementing - there may be some scope for improvement.\r\n\r\nBasically we have two different areas of \"precision & scale\"\r\n\r\nA schema can define a type with precision and scale but then values manipulated from the records will also have a precision and scale.  The DataType represented by DecimalDataType stores the schema defined precision and scale - but the values themselves, internally represented by the BigDecimal type take on the precision and scale of the value held.\r\n\r\nSo a string of \"100.00\" assigned to a BigDecimal would have precision of 5 and scale of 2\r\n\r\nI guess the question is do we want to enforce the schema defined precision and scale throughout the handling of values and where necessary truncate/round values so they adhere to the schema defined precision and scale?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/602161276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/602181635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4104#issuecomment-602181635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4104","id":602181635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjE4MTYzNQ==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-22T11:04:25Z","updated_at":"2020-03-22T11:04:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll try to find some time today to play around with the APIs to see what validation is even possible.

A ton of effort has gone into the tests on all platforms. A large number of tests were not written to work on windows but none of those that I've found are related to timing issues but instead are due to actual 'test wont work on windows' issues. The issue that occurred in this case appears to be a corrupt zip file.
