In addition, some text files in the Git repo had CRLF line endings, and were thus checked out as-is under Cygwin. When (hypothetically) committing those text files, their CRLF line endings would have been converted to LF in the index when using the Window implementation, and that version in the index would then be different from the original version in the repo. I *think* this is was caused NetBeans to display the files as modified. In any case, cleaning up the line endings in the remote repo and cloning it locally using the Windows Git implementation seems to have resolved the problem for me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1514541711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1514832514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5843#issuecomment-1514832514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5843","id":1514832514,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5aSoKC","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-19T14:24:51Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T14:24:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There

Frgaal is a solution looking for a problem IMO.  It doesn't address any actual issues we face. Any use of a non-standard compiler (frgaal or nb-javac) is going to run into a massive brick wall here, for a whole load of issues people have already brought up.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, that's far from the best or most fruitful way this project could still continue to innovate.  You're currently working on what I consider (and have used as an example in talks for years) a potentially very interesting project in the tooling space.  Lessons from that would be far more interesting to learn IMO.  I'd love to see us be more innovative and clear about what differentiates NetBeans from other options into the future.  If all that amounts to is frgaal, that really would be a sad state of affairs!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1515905426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1515926966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5853#issuecomment-1515926966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5853","id":1515926966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5aWzW2","user":{"login":"tmysik","id":331924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik","html_url":"https://github.com/tmysik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T08:24:37Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T08:25:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Overall looks good to me.

It was created by jaxb2-maven-plugin without encoding property. The file could not be opened in NetBeans at all (there was an encoding warning dialog). It was also stored in my SVN Repository. When I opened the projekt, NetBeans hangs in a neverending loop \"Scanning Background Projects\". I identified the problem project by quickly clicking on the details of the background process. After deleting the file or closing the project, the problem was gone. \r\n\r\nIssue Impact: I spent several hours to solve the problem. May be other problems I had this week were also related to this issue (Java files did not compile on save by nb-javac). The problem also may cause overheating of your computer because it requires significant CPU resources and you may not notice it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1516201855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1516203218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4967#issuecomment-1516203218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4967","id":1516203218,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5aX2zS","user":{"login":"UhligIT","id":7893319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4OTMzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7893319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT","html_url":"https://github.com/UhligIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UhligIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T11:58:34Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T11:58:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Related Issue here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4762","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1516203218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1516249283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5842#issuecomment-1516249283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5842","id":1516249283,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5aYCDD","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T12:33:59Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T12:33:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":" Note to self: merge fixing commits into their original feature commits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1516249283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1516359712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5859#issuecomment-1516359712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5859","id":1516359712,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5aYdAg","user":{"login":"thurka","id":22048069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDQ4MDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22048069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka","html_url":"https://github.com/thurka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thurka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-20T13:46:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T13:46:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This cannot be done.

It is a conscious decision on behalf of OpenJDK not to go down the \"backporting\" compiler route and also to use JDK-1 features in the javac. That can be questioned and criticized and I'd like to see a different decision, but it is not the case.\r\n\r\nThe onset of \"frgaal\" now is, that a fork of javac can accomplish what \"plain\" javac failed to do: A backporting javac, that can run on old versions of java. This is all noble, but how high is the bus-factor of this? For \"plain\" javac I don't see it going anytime soon. Even if Oracle would drop OpenJDK today, there are multiple companies backing the development, which already demonstrated, that they take over where Oracle drops the ball (Oracle tried to monetize their OpenJDK build and utterly failed as multiple vendors stood up to provide builds).\r\n\r\nWhat is more, I'm pissed how this was brought in. The base PR, that brought the possibility for this, was advertised as an option to test nbjavac (turns out, that might have not been the whole truth). In that PR I pointed out, that there are problems, that make this not suitable for inclusion as a general solution (one such example is violating the contract for properties). I also pointed out, that the JDK has a mechanism to patch its javac with some handwaving, that was rejected.\r\n\r\nFrom my POV the build system of NetBeans is complex enough without having to consider a wild mix of java compilers.\r\n\r\n> In a world we have dependencies at our hands, would it be still an issue ?\r\n\r\nHow many people here are qualified to work on the java compiler and how many of this (I suspect) small group are willing to do it.

No other ClassLoader should be affected.\r\n\r\nAs for the `eager` and `autoload` tweaks, there's a slight chance that it changes behaviour, especially the first start - varying on different systems. But it seems easy to test:\r\n- there should not be any complaint that a module cannot be enabled in the startup log (except possibly javafx)\r\n- if JDK runtime supports javafx, exactly one module (for the runtime platform) should load\r\n- it's best to test **without** ergonomic cluster with all standalone modules enabled\r\n\r\nThe fix itself can be easily tested on a network where PAC is
