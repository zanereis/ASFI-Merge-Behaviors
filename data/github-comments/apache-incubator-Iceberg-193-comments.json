If you look at the error message, it says that one of the file set groups failed to be rewritten. This _usually_ happens when there's a concurrent write or other operation on the table that prevents the data rewrite from proceeding (if it would break ACID compliance).\r\n\r\nHowever, I do see the final error message shows that Table `hive.wrk.my_table` not found.\r\n\r\nWhen you use `spark.sql(\"show tables in hive\")` or `spark.sql(\"show tables in hive.wrk\")`, are you able to see the table?\r\n\r\nGiven that you didn't set the `uri` property as found in the first example here, https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-configuration/#catalogs, I think you need to be sure that the table is registered as `hive.wrk.my_table`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I don't see in the code where you configured the spark session. In order to use `SparkActions.get()`, you need to have an active properly initialized Spark session. Otherwise, it defaults to the [current active spark session](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/ce5128f09cc697455e76af08ce6ce3c9c5b08b70/spark/v3.3/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/actions/SparkActions.java#L46-L48).\r\n\r\nSo I'd suggest:\r\n1. Ensure that the program, as written, can see the table when you use `spark.sql(\"SHOW TABLES IN ....\")`.\r\n2. Consider passing the URI directly to the catalog properties when configuring it.\r\n3. Make sure that `wrk` is really the namespace, and that the table isn't _named_ `wrk.my_table`.\r\n\r\nIf you provide the way you configured the program and submitted it, as well as check the output of `spark.sql(\"SHOW TABLES IN ....\")` and then run `DESCRIBE EXTENDED TABLE ...` on that table, that should help.\r\n\r\nI think it's likely that you just need to properly initialize the Spark session (in order to use the SparkActions provider), aka `SparkSession.builder().....getOrCreate()` properly for the `spark` object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1215361026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1215362318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5515#issuecomment-1215362318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5515","id":1215362318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IcPUO","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-15T16:52:53Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T16:52:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"But

But that might not be the common case. Does it have to be rebuilt entirely every time?\r\n\r\nI think it has a lot of value for interop with specific BI tools that are used for presentations etc that the end user really doesn’t have a choice on.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, I’ve seen this needed especially for specific one off things like financial report demonstrations where the BI tool is for some reason set in stone.\r\n\r\nI’m not familiar enough with the format and concerns with schema evolution — again, usually my usage of it has been one off or rebuild / reload on every “refresh” — but I do think this would be good for Iceberg overall.\r\n\r\nBut ensuring schema and properly applied deletes on every creation should be done with a lot of care.\r\n\r\nAt least for BI tools that wouldn’t support a custom format at all (as this is much less efficient than reading the Iceberg table directly). I can share concern with not discouraging other tools from skipping on supporting Iceberg natively. But maybe this will provide those tools more of an incentive in the long run.\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents on the matter. 100% happy to learn more about the format’s specifics to help support it if need be. 🙂 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1216075644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1216122254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5410#issuecomment-1216122254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5410","id":1216122254,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IfI2O","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-16T04:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T04:12:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Does such change require documentation in the iceberg project?

Then we could short-circuit and re-use existing files if there are no schema evolution, delete files, and default values defined, and do a full rewrite if there are. Thinking it could be a nice counterpart to 'import'.  Then users who are primarily interested in the base features of Iceberg but not necessarily some advanced ones like schema-evolution, default value, or merge-on-read, a cheaper interop with non-Iceberg environments, but its still correct even if there are those features.  @rdblue wondering if that makes more sense?  cc @aokolnychyi @RussellSpitzer ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1218383697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1218412926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5543#issuecomment-1218412926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5543","id":1218412926,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85In4F-","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-17T19:34:51Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T19:34:51Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yea im not too famililar with the code, but it sounds resaonable to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1218412926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1218476324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5565#issuecomment-1218476324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5565","id":1218476324,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85IoHkk","user":{"login":"t0ma-sz","id":23321688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzIxNjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23321688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz","html_url":"https://github.com/t0ma-sz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0ma-sz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-17T20:48:40Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T20:48:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > ```\r\n> > val tableExists = sparkSession.catalog.tableExists(s\"$dbName.$tableName\")\r\n> > ```\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I think this is happening because you haven't specified the catalog name in identifier of write to and neither made my_catalog as default ....\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> can you please try once with 3 part identifier here i.e sparkSession.catalog.tableExists(s\"$catalog.$dbName.$tableName\")\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ref : A ticket stating similar issue : [#2202 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2202#issuecomment-786301938)\r\n\r\nThanks for your input.
