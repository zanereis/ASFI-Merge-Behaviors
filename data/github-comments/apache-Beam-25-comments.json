I have reproduced the error you are seeing. \n\nThe problem is you are importing and calling apache_beam.\\* packages before the completion of the setuptools.setup() call. That call is responsible for installing requirements (including dill). Anything prior to that call should be self contained should not depend on anything but whatever is available in a default Python installation.\n\nI understand this creates a chicken and egg problem. I am not familiar with maven - python integrations. Do you know how other people approach this problem?\n\nOne option I can think of is to open and parse the xml file for the version string inside the setup.py without using lxml (e.g. a single string search for version). It may not be robust but it will address this
