To be specific, if you had a call on a GroovyObject using invokeMethod that does not exist, then the meta class logic for the fallback to invokeMethod was sometimes triggered leading to an endless loop. I think we reliably solved that back then, but I don't remember where this logic was (maybe in the callsite stuff and/or the bytecode interface) exactly.

one more comment on the change.. as done it will check only if setting the property via the meta class. Is c1.metaClass = c2.metaClass  really supposed to go through the whole MOP if c1 is a Groovy class? Do we not directly set it (https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/java/org/codehaus/groovy/classgen/Verifier.java#L467) directly? And at the very least... if the call is done from Java it will also not work. Maybe this is one of those cases where the DGM added methods shadow the methods defined on the class? I guess so... feels really kind of broken.

not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/522004277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/522013107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/994#issuecomment-522013107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/994","id":522013107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjAxMzEwNw==","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T13:42:27Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T13:42:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To
