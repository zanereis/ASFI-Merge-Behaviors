For example, when user enters 'SHOW DATABASES' and after limitation wrapping 'SELECT * FROM (SHOW DATABASES) LIMIT 10' will be posted.

Was expecting one of: <IDENTIFIER> ... `. \r\n\r\nCould you please fix the issue and test limit functionality with all non-select kinds of queries supported by Drill ? Also I'd like to kindly ask you for change tooltip for question mark from onclick alert to on hover one, for example see [Tooltips](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_tooltip.asp). Thank you in advance.

I also agree with Igor. Parsing query on the client side is error prone (I already can think of two cases that was missed: values queries and multiline comments) and looks like overhead when on server side we have all means to add query limit without line by line parsing. You don't need to change existing REST API, just add new call for Web UI that would pass limit along with the query. You can also take a look at JDBC calls where limit 0 is added for the queries to find out data

I agree with you we should not be trying to do things perfectly, that's why I mainly only focus on functional correctness in my reviews and avoid superficial comments about variable names and shortening lines of code. As you've experienced first hand with HashAgg, getting memory calculations right is extremely tricky, and they're even trickier to debug when users hit bugs. Let's make sure the logic is rock solid and unit tested while everything is still fresh in our minds. Doing this now will save us a lot more time in the coming months. Plus I think we are getting pretty close, I don't think there is that much code left to write.\r\n\r\nIf there is a time crunch and this needs to go into our private branch soon, I have no issues with putting this into the private branch, and continuing the review process in open source. Since the changes are mainly in the memory calculators, the chances of any significant merge conflict are almost zero.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/454667185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/454851669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1530#issuecomment-454851669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1530","id":454851669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDg1MTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T16:47:14Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T16:47:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vdiravka @ilooner Would you mind taking a look at this?

I have addressed the review comments. Regarding the multi column predicate testing for semi-join this test case is already added in the previous checkin. It produces the semi-join plan. I have not checked for the correctness of the result in the test case because this is having an issue when assertions are enabled in the runtime code. I will talk to @Ben-Zvi  and open an issue. However, I have checked for the correctness manually and it does produce correct rows. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/457802682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/457881776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1530#issuecomment-457881776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1530","id":457881776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Nzg4MTc3Ng==","user":{"login":"karthik-man","id":430469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQ2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/430469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man","html_url":"https://github.com/karthik-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karthik-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-27T01:50:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T01:50:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@priteshm Charles and I are already having a discussion about this on the dev mailing list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/457881776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
