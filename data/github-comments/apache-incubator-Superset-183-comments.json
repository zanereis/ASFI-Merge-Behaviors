This WIP together with the fix from #6453 should now make life easier on Redshift. This PR has been in use in production for a few months and has been tested to work very reliably with Snowflake. BigQuery and Redshift have also been tested to work, although not as extensively. I also don't see any reason why Oracle and DB2 shouldn't now work (along with any other quirky dialect/engine), but haven't tested against them. If you have the time to give this a go I would be very thankful. If all is good I can make a last thorough check of the code before submitting this as a SIP, as I'm sure this will need to be thoroughly reviewed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/443174884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/443257379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6469#issuecomment-443257379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6469","id":443257379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzI1NzM3OQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-30T16:23:48Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T16:23:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6469?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6469](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6469?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/5f7817a6a3a532f4f9b9a72aabc1d9755715137d?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6469/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6469?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #6469   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   73.31%   73.31%           \n=======================================\n  Files          67       67           \n  Lines        9591     9591           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7032     7032           \n  Misses       2559     2559\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6469?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6469?src=pr&el=footer).

PR #6386 fixes the latter two to handle invalid format strings and show `ERROR` instead (with unit tests). \r\n\r\nHowever\r\n- The direct calls to `d3.format` are still vulnerable.\r\n- There was a case at Airbnb with `Infinity` value that crash Table vis, which was not handled by #6386 because the issue is with the **value**, not the **format** string.\r\n\r\nTo resolve these, in this PR, all the three calls above are replaced with `getNumberFormatter(format)` or `formatNumber(format, value)` from `@superset-ui/number-format`. These two functions can handle both invalid **formats** and **values** and have been written with unit tests. \r\n- `formatNumber('.abc', 200)` => `200 (Invalid format: .abc)`\r\n- `formatNumber('.2f', Infinity)` => `∞`\r\n\r\nSee unit tests\r\n- [NumberFormatter tests](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-number-format/test/NumberFormatter.test.js)\r\n- [createD3NumberFormatter tests](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-number-format/test/factories/createD3NumberFormatter.test.js)\r\n\r\nI also add backward compatibility shim in `setupFormatter.js` to point `+,` format, which is listed as one of default values in dropdown, but is now considered an invalid format by latest D3 to point to `+,d`, which is the correct equivalent format.

Auto-refresh should run periodically as along as we have queries not finished in backend. For query in rendering state, it should be finished in backend and also fetched into browser already. Not sure we should still check status of these queries in the backend?\r\n\r\n- see this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/fc3b68e23433522b3a6d7327cc95199bf01dcf96/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/constants.js#L12\r\n\r\nThis is all available status for the lifecycle of a query. If you add a state, can you also update this set?

Updates:\r\n1. Good catch. I have removed `rendering` state from QueryAutoRefresh, so after query results arrive in browser, it will not query backend again. This is really a good point.\r\n\r\n2. https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/fc3b68e23433522b3a6d7327cc95199bf01dcf96/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/constants.js#L12 is used in [QuerySearch](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/fc3b68e23433522b3a6d7327cc95199bf01dcf96/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/components/QuerySearch.jsx#L230). Not only `rendering` state is not in `STATUS_OPTION`, but also `stopped` and `fetching`. We will only need to add new state to `STATUS_OPTION` if we want to search for it in `QuerySearch`. I don't think we need to search for a query in `rendering` state as it is super fast that no query will remain in that state for a long time. Not adding `rendering` to `STATUS_OPTION` should be the same reason as why `fetching` is not in it either.\r\n\r\n3. I digged into the sqllab code and the lifecycle I believe was designed as below:\r\n\r\n- For `sync` queries: `running  -> success / failed / stopped`\r\n- For `async` queries: `pending -> running -> fetching -> success` or `pending -> running -> fetching -> failed`\r\n\r\nAfter I added the rendering state, it should look like:\r\n\r\n- For `sync` queries: `running  -> rendering -> success / failed / stopped`\r\n- For `async` queries: `pending -> running -> fetching -> rendering -> success` or `pending -> running -> fetching -> failed`\r\n\r\nThe `success` here I think means that query result is successfully rendered on UI, but not the real-time state for query running in backend. Backend query state is in `query.results` which may already says `success`, while browser side is showing `fetching` or `rendering`.\r\n\r\nI am open to redesign the lifecycle of a query, but this should be in a new PR as this PR is to fix the bug without aiming to redesign a new lifecycle.

That works when the metric label is part of `payload.data`. We may want to do an all-around sweap of each visualization and make sure things are hooked up properly, that no other viz make the same mistake as `BigNumber`.\r\n\r\nFor example, NVD3 line chart metrics are in sync because we bake them in the `payload.data` as \"Series Labels\". The fix for `BigNumber` could have been to add metrics information to the `payload.data` by reshaping it somehow, but the metric info is there in `payload.formData` so I used it in my fix.\r\n\r\nAnyhow to me it's not a timing issue as much as pointing to references that in-time may be be out of sync. The fix I push makes sure that in-time, the references should always be consistent.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/444164263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/444166802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5800#issuecomment-444166802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5800","id":444166802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDE2NjgwMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-04T16:37:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T16:37:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"914

It is great, however, it makes the visualization code hard to maintain and make the js bundle size larger. Due to this reason, the Superset community has proposed https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/5692, a js plugin system, to separate the visualization code from the superset core infra.  You can also check one example we are working on https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/50. It will be great if you can follow the same structure and help us to embrace the visualization plug-in system and any suggestion are welcome! \r\n\r\ncc @SpyderRivera ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/444969390/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/444993079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5667#issuecomment-444993079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5667","id":444993079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDk5MzA3OQ==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T19:12:37Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T19:12:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @rojan507 this is not quite ready to embed in an external app. It is likely that this ability will be added chart by chart because we have to migrate backend code for every vis type to the client to allow for JS-only plugins.

When we sort out what we need to do to consider these valid releases by ASF standards, we can start trying out this process.\r\n\r\nProposed process:\r\n\r\n1. Always cut on Monday (rc0 and release). If it is a public holiday, postpone to the next business day.\r\nTake a week for testing and bug fixing\r\n2. Cherry pick bug fixes for rc1.\r\n       a. Decide if the release is stable enough to deploy. A release would be stable if it has no known major regressions or new bugs blocking critical functionality.\r\n       b. If not:\r\n       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) If there’s something blocking the release that’s easy to revert, we’ll revert it\r\n       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) Go back to step 2 for rc2\r\n3. At week 2 if it is not releasable, identify the main blocking issues\r\n4. At week 3 revert the blockers if not resolved and start a [Vote] email\r\n5. Tag the release as release 1.1\r\n6. Continue to fix bugs on this release until the next release goes out.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/817955/49607288-6019cd80-f94a-11e8-989b-2882bb167073.png)\r\n\r\nWe’ll cut 1.1.0 two weeks after 1.0.0 is cut, and go through the same process. There should not be more than two branches open at a time so 1.2.0 will not be cut until the following Monday after 1.0.0 goes out. If maintaining two branches is too complicated, we may just have one.\r\n\r\nA branch shouldn’t take more than 4 weeks to be released because blockers should be reverted at week 3.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this process\r\n\r\n- Those involved in feature development have enough time to find, and triage issues. Ideally all contributors would be deploying these changes to a test environment and looking for issues.\r\n- There’s enough time so that whoever introduced the regression can address it. They should be communicating with whoever cut the branch when they expect the bug to be fixed. By default the person cutting the branch will not be responsible for fixing all bugs for a deployment, and contributors should maintain ownership of the successful deployment of their features. If a bug does not get fixed in 4 weeks, the feature will be reverted.\r\n- There’s a regular structure and clear process so that we all can efficiently and regularly make deployments.\r\n\r\nThrough this process committers should:\r\n- Use a “risk:xxx” tag to mark PRs that need thorough testing. Things that may require “risk” tag: db_migration, large feature, or changing large or brittle sections of code.\r\n- Tag PRs with the release they should go to\r\n- Tag issues as a bug and which release(s) the bug is in\r\n\r\nCC: @john-bodley @kristw ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/445004118/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/445013405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6493#issuecomment-445013405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6493","id":445013405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTAxMzQwNQ==","user":{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-06T20:11:28Z","updated_at":"2018-12-06T20:11:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I saw that you previously excluded all the large thumbnails. \r\n\r\n```\r\nrecursive-exclude superset/static/images/viz_thumbnails_large *\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese large thumbnails were recently moved to vis-specific folders under `src/visualizations` so the exclusion rule above does not get rid of the thumbnail images.
