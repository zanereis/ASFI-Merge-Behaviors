Also, I suppose, that we should leave to user the final conclusion to instrument methods of\r\n> his or her service or not.

My + is for Andrey Gura’s suggestion ( http://apache-ignite-developers.2346864.n4.nabble.com/Reference-of-local-service-tp46071p46307.html ) :\r\n“we should provide a way for configuring service metrics (in\r\nsense of enabled/disabled) during service deploy. It's easy for cases\r\nwhere deploy() methods have ServiceConfiguration as parameter.”\r\n\r\nThe reasons:\r\n-\tIt is quite obvious. Good place without any other condition.\r\n-\tCacheConfiguration has same property.
