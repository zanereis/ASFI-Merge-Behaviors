For a general op like `unique`, we should follow numpy API, rather than being too specific to TF. PyTorch unique should be supported by the same API. Framework specific details should go into the frontend.\r\n\r\nNumpy and PyTorch supports `dim` argument to do unique on multidimensional input, but I don't think it's a good idea. So restricting to 1D, at least for the first implementation, sounds good to me.\r\n\r\nWe can implement `unique` via sorting and cumsum (without hash table). If implemented this way, the same code works on both CPU and GPU. That's I'm planning to do, but if you feel brave, you can try that in this PR :slightly_smiling_face:  But it is likely not going to be faster than the hash table based implementation, since it requires multiple passes over input. This could be useful if the hash based impl cannot be used for some

I am working on a new TF parser from scratch, to be introduced as ~/python/tvm/relay/frontend/tensorflow2.py. I will share this work soon. The new parser will support control flow v2 op(While/If), instead of control flow v1 op (Enter/Exist/Merge). A lot of the existing parser code which deal with control flow v1 are not needed in the new TF parser. The new parser will support TensorList* ops instead of TensorArray* ops. TensorArray* ops are no longer needed in TF2.x models. The new parser will also handle stateful LSTM models (and similar stateful TF models). My goal this year include leveraging the TF XLA infrastructure to simplify the parser.  TF2.x has introduced many significant changes and deprecated some old ways of doing things.

Thanks for the explanation and it is very helpful!\r\nIt looks like the main thing we need to do is to implement a `topi.adjacent_difference` op similar to `thrust::adjacent_difference`. And in the frontend, we do something like:\r\n```python\r\nsorted_data = relay.sort(data)\r\nargsort_indices = relay.argsort(data)\r\nadj_diff = relay.adjacent_difference(sorted_data, first_value=0, \"not_equal\")\r\nex_scan = relay.cumsum(adj_diff, exclusive=True)\r\ninverse_indices = relay.scatter(data, argsort_indices, ex_scan)\r\nunique = relay.scatter(data, ex_scan, sorted_data)\r\nunique_sliced = relay.strided_slice(unique, [0], relay.take(ex_scan,[-1]), slice_mode=\"size\")\r\nreturn unique_sliced, inverse_indices\r\n```\r\nI saw PyTorch uses `thrust::unique` to get the `unique` array. I think we can use `relay.scatter` to do the same thing.\r\n\r\nTo support counting, it looks like we need to implement a `topi.unique_by_key` op similar to `thrust::unique_by_key`. I think maybe we can do it in a different PR and focus on `adjacent_difference` in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/780387355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/780440200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7441#issuecomment-780440200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7441","id":780440200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MDQ0MDIwMA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-17T09:56:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T09:58:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For your first implementation, combination-based approach is ok.
