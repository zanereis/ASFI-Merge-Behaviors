My request for failures to be addressed prior to merging is not a “while your are at it” sort of request. Any other PR that results in a failure would be rejected, so should this one. I am all for reducing toxic culture but this card needs to be played appropriately. Used in a context like this I feel it undermines our efforts.\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly that this PR did not warrant the need to pass CI, or otherwise addressing a reviewers changes, you should have follow up with that reviewer to get the approval. Setting a precedent of ignoring concerns of committer is more toxic. It sends the message that if your disapproval of a commit is not shared by the author it can just be ignore without further discussion so why bother speaking up. Especially so in a situation where the reviewer is attempting to uphold our principles of development.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while the content of the PR was approved I don’t feel the merge itself was. Others raised questions about the significantly increase time and stability issues. I see no reason to race to commit such an change without fully addressing those concerns. \r\n\r\nIf you feel like a conversation around the use of toxic language and how to police it needs to happen I would gladly have that discussion on the dev list. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/493634719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/493637590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3606#issuecomment-493637590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3606","id":493637590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzYzNzU5MA==","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-18T01:22:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-18T01:22:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I’m mostly indifferent, though I lean to the side of not trying to hack around concourse odd layouts.

My test pipeline was all green before merging, and at this moment the main pipeline is also all green.  \r\n\r\nThe time the Windows tests take has been clearly communicated from the outset, and has not changed (other than now they start and finish 2 hours sooner than before).  Like you, I look forward to seeing us iterate on understanding and improving those times, now that they are more visible.\r\n\r\nI apologize for rushing to get this merged before confirming with you that your concerns had been handled.  I misjudged that they had been satisfactorily ameliorated. I am willing to revert until everything is settled to your satisfaction (or you can feel free to revert).\r\n\r\nI admit I am confused on what you are measuring when you talk about a \"feedback cycle\".  The defect fixed by this PR was that we were silently treating a third of our test failures as green for the purpose of publishing the latest stable SHA.  False negatives destroy confidence in the entire pipeline, so fixing as soon as possible (once we established that the tests were indeed testing a supported feature of Geode) seems not unreasonable, and getting it in before the weekend gives a chance to monitor (and revert if anything is not as expected).  As far as developer feedback, this PR made no changes to the PR pipeline, and still offers developers all the same feedback that was available in the main pipeline before (with fewer clicks and 2 hours faster).  If a developer makes a change that breaks only on Windows, in fact now they will get that feedback approximately 2 weeks faster than before (yes, it really did take that long to notice some breakages earlier this month).  I acknowledge that work related to the hidden job Benchmarks will now have a longer feedback cycle.  If it is in active development it might make sense to spin up a feature pipeline that omits most long-running test jobs...and we should probably try to avoid hidden jobs in the main pipeline anyway...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/493638427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/493694559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3606#issuecomment-493694559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3606","id":493694559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzY5NDU1OQ==","user":{"login":"mcmellawatt","id":1082688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI2ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1082688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt","html_url":"https://github.com/mcmellawatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmellawatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-18T17:44:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-18T17:44:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm also fairly indifferent to the tall pipeline view, especially since it won't be an issue once we remove JDK11 jobs.

That's what I documented on the Geode wiki in the past and have been using for years.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/499685898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/499686229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3650#issuecomment-499686229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3650","id":499686229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5OTY4NjIyOQ==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-06T22:08:38Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T22:08:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bschuchardt The diff for DistributedSystemIntegrationTest is 4th commit down in the commits tab.

When the InternalDistributedSystem creates the StatisticsManager singleton it passes the disabled flag in. If they are disabled then every Statistics instance created by that manager is a dummy. Given that, I was wondering why FunctionStats has its own dummy. It could have just created one like normal and it would have been a dummy. I think the reason was so it could have a single dummy instance instead of one for every named function. If you look at InternalDistributedSystem.getFunctionStats(String) it would have to look up the dummy each time in a concurrentMap.

I've also heard that we're not investing much effort on `Pulse` anymore and the idea is to replace it completely in the near future, so I honestly saw no point in cleaning the entire class, just cleaned up the method I had to fix.\r\nBut yeah, I agree with you in that we should clean and improve the source code we touch 👍 .\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/500628139/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/500631463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3677#issuecomment-500631463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3677","id":500631463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDYzMTQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T23:36:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T23:36:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I was wondering about the same thing as @jujoramos , maybe the numOfJMXConnections should be a thread local?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/500631463/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/500644305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3622#issuecomment-500644305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3622","id":500644305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDY0NDMwNQ==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T00:49:35Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T00:49:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR has been updated to revert the first approach and go with option #4 instead.

That would require changing PRHARedundancyProvider to not read any values from prStats. So, I assume this would be a temporary improvement to get past any issues caused by redundancy provider not working properly when one of the int stats read by PRHARedundancyProvider wraps to zero?\r\n\r\nThis PR does fix GEODE-6834. The problem being fixed is that some of the stats on PartionedRegionStats were 32-bit ints which could wrap around when doing local operation and cause the value of the statistic when it is displayed to be hard to understand. So this PR addressed that by changing those stats to be 64-bit longs.\r\nWhile working on it we found that the redundancy provider was reading stats from PartitionedRegionStats. Features are not supposed to do this but should instead maintain their own counter. Since stats can be disabled (and when read disabled always return 0) having product feature depend on stats is a bad idea. We filed a new ticket: GEODE-6849 but this PR does not fix GEODE-6849.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/500906599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/500983476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3688#issuecomment-500983476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3688","id":500983476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDk4MzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"jujoramos","id":8254001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8254001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos","html_url":"https://github.com/jujoramos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T19:15:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T19:15:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @agingade,\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing this PR!.

great for develop.\r\n\r\nJust looking at the diff, I can't quite picture what the changes will look like for a release pipeline.  I like that you removed the conditionals that suppressed UpdatePassingRef from appearing in release pipelines, thank you!  We should never have conditionalized those at all, and I am glad to see the simplifications!  Are there any further conditionals that could be removed as well?\r\n\r\nAlso, can you please comment whether you tested these changes in a release-branch context or only in a develop context?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/501382677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/501384803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3700#issuecomment-501384803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3700","id":501384803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTM4NDgwMw==","user":{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-12T17:51:10Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T17:51:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This work was done on the wrong code base.
