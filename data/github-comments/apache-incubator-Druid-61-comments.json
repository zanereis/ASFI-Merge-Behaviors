However, to produce v8 segments for an UT, `IndexMerger` is needed to change to make v8 by introducing another boolean flag which prevents `IndexMerger` from converting v8 to v9.

I think including an UT is still good to do though.\nhttps://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/io/druid/segment/IndexMerger.java#L1009\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/178294658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/178299097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2347#issuecomment-178299097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2347","id":178299097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODI5OTA5Nw==","user":{"login":"r4ruchir","id":14929150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTI5MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14929150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir","html_url":"https://github.com/r4ruchir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4ruchir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T01:36:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T01:36:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Fangjin,\nI am working with our legal team to get CLA and hoping I will get in 1-2 days.\nThanks,\nRuchir\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/178299097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/178299997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2216#issuecomment-178299997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2216","id":178299997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODI5OTk5Nw==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T01:40:04Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T01:40:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pjain1 @rasahner @himanshug @navis @gianm \n\nThis is no longer WIP and is ready to be merged.
