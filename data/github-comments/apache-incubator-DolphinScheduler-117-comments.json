The reason for this issue is that when the `master` or `worker` reconnects to `zookeeper`, `zkClient` will produce a `RECONNECTED` event, the register will respond to this event.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/68301db6b914ff4002bfbc531c6810864d8e47c2/dolphinscheduler-server/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/server/master/registry/MasterRegistry.java#L83-L98\r\nThe register will execute `zookeeperRegistryCenter.getRegisterOperator().persistEphemeral(localNodePath, \"\");` to create an ephemeral node, this is reasonable.\r\nBut the `persistEphemeral` method will do two things to create an ephemeral node.\r\n1. delete the ephemeral node(if exist)\r\n2. create a new ephemeral node\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/68301db6b914ff4002bfbc531c6810864d8e47c2/dolphinscheduler-service/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/service/zk/ZookeeperOperator.java#L192-L201\r\nIn this case,  if the `master` or `worker` reconnected to zookeeper, the ephemeral node may exist, because the session may not have expired.\r\nSo the `persistEphemeral` method will delete the existing ephemeral node and create a new one. The problem is that when delete the node, it will produce a `NODE_REMOVED` event, and the `ZKMasterClient` will response this event, move the master to dead server. And the `HeartBeatTask` will close the master.\r\n---\r\nI think a good way to solve this issue is when we create an ephemeral node after reconnect, if the node exist, we shouldn't remove it. In this case the node.\r\nWe just need to modify this method to change the line 196 just return.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/68301db6b914ff4002bfbc531c6810864d8e47c2/dolphinscheduler-service/src/main/java/org/apache/dolphinscheduler/service/zk/ZookeeperOperator.java#L192-L201","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/842175284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/842184161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5487#issuecomment-842184161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5487","id":842184161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MjE4NDE2MQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T09:46:53Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T09:46:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi:\n*
