Will different zk endpoints be an issue for data sync across different components? For instance, entries created on cli needs to be read by Tmaster.\r\n\r\n2.

and I had a chat about this and here is what we are thinking of.\r\nCurrently heron supports two types of tunneling mechanism(socks, ssh port forwarding), but this isn't explicitly specified anywhere in the config and the bindings are somewhat hardcoded. We will clarify this by doing the following\r\n1. Just like what exists, heron.statemgr.is.tunnel.needed will be the decider switch to see if we need any kind of tunneling at all.\r\n2. We introduce a new variable called heron.statemgr.tunnel.type that defines the kinds of tunneling options. We will support SOCKS, SSH_PORT_FORWARD, LOCAL_PORT_FORWARD as accepted values\r\n3. We introduce a new variable called heron.statemgr.tunnel.port which is needed for the local port forwarding case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/310741904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/310742418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1770#issuecomment-310742418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1770","id":310742418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDc0MjQxOA==","user":{"login":"huijunw","id":23125934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTI1OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23125934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw","html_url":"https://github.com/huijunw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-23T18:38:37Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T18:40:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This feature will not merge.
