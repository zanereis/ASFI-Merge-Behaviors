There are few design aspects of it I wanted to discuss with you here\n\nFrom the diff tab:\n\n> +116 −36  Options \n\nThis approach, namely, extracting `RevisionId` looks interesting, but in this particular case it brings 80 new LOC, adds extra class, uses generics, parameterized types, `instance of` and a wildcard (which is impressive list of language features)\n\nIf I try to understand, what are the benefits of  `Something<?>` compared to `Something`, given that `Something` is not some kind of collection, but I'm having hard time doing it. I think there are none, and Java Language Specification, section [4.8 Raw Types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.8) support my guess.\n\n> Raw types are closely related to wildcards. Both are based on existential types. Raw types can be thought of as wildcards whose type rules are deliberately unsound, to accommodate interaction with legacy code. Historically, raw types preceded wildcards;\n\n---\n\nI think we are on the way of coming up with a better design here together, so let's try to follow Occam's razor design principle and think in term of API.\n\nFirst of all, here is current problem, how I see: we are talking about design of the \"Notebook Repository subsystem or API\" that abstracts (hides all implementation details of) the process of getting an information about notebooks and it's lineage from the persistent storage. \n\nThis subsystem provides a _public and uniform API_ for all it's clients to get the a notebooks, together with their history (modifications\\snapshots). \n\n`NotebookRepo` is part of it, it defines the semantics of the storage (list, get, etc), \n\n`Revision` is another part of it that  represents a point in time, selected and annotated by the user. We want `NotebookRepo` semantics to be aware of of such entities.\n\nIn terms of API design, first question to ask is always the same - \"who are the clients\"? \n\nIn our case there are:\n- `NotebookServer.java`\n- `Notebook.java`\n\nIf we agree on this general terms, I'll be happy to go on, and discuss possible ways to solve this problem. Please, et me know what you think!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/237463903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/237478270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1279#issuecomment-237478270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1279","id":237478270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzQ3ODI3MA==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T07:46:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T07:46:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sarutak Thanks for taking care of this.
