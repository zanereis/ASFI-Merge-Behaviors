am very interested in this problem, and I have a few different approaches I want to try out. However, I wonder if requiring intermediate results to be collected is too labor intensive or unnecessary. In the AutoTVM setting, we use domain specific features as they are powerful and allow for transfer learning. However, transfer learning is not as important in this setting, and it could be that blackbox features (e.g., just the scale configuration) may be enough to build a usable machine learning model (just as knob features are usable in AutoTVM). I think if that turns out to already work then we can save a significant amount of effort. It seems slightly expensive to compute both the original graph and annotated graph every time we want to do try a different calibration configuration, so I think it would be great if we could get away with doing even less work :).\r\n\r\nI'll send updates on this approach as I get results. You may have already guessed that performance is important as I am first tuning the workloads required for quantization so trying many calibration configurations is not too slow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/466304109/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/466353250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2656#issuecomment-466353250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2656","id":466353250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjM1MzI1MA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T10:38:03Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T10:38:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
