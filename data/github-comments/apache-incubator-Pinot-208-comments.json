But it does seem to be to clock skew. You effectively see small, single digit millisecond differences where the load time on the server is 2-4ms earlier than the job submission time.\r\n\r\nThere's really no non-hacky way to solve this without storing some state that ties the segment name to the reload job id it reloaded for. I'm not sure how feasible that is. I think for now I'll probably just change the check internally to give it like a 5 second buffer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1758216417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1758224103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11781#issuecomment-1758224103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11781","id":1758224103,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5ozF7n","user":{"login":"deemoliu","id":15416419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE2NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15416419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu","html_url":"https://github.com/deemoliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T18:12:38Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T18:12:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"do you mean the cloned dataset and the new dataset will be sharing the same copy of segments in the deepstore?\r\nthere might be a race condition if one of the table is deleting the segment while another dataset does't aware of the deletion.

@dario-liberman Thanks for providing the context! The docs you referenced are actually window functions, and here are some discussions around it #7213. It is not really possible to achieve it with single-stage engine (we can potentially bring everything back to broker, but it is not a scale solution when the table is large). We already have it implemented in the multi-stage engine, and we should explore if this feature can fit into that. cc @walterddr \n> \n> @alexch2000 I don't think a new transform function can solve the moving time window problem because this calculation cannot fit into single-stage engine model.\n\nI work together with @alexch2000 - I actually suggested this approach so we can have moving windows in single stage. The trick is to take advantage of multivalued group by in Pinot. By assigning each row to multiple windows, one achieves the hopping window behaviour. This function is most useful when one groups by it, similar to how one groups by the regular date time convert to achieve a tumble window.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1761997985/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1761999763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11775#issuecomment-1761999763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11775","id":1761999763,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5pBfuT","user":{"login":"dario-liberman","id":130933669,"node_id":"U_kgDOB83jpQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130933669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dario-liberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-13T18:29:52Z","updated_at":"2023-10-13T18:29:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
