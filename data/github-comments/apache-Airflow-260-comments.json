This is a poor choice because it requires running a java process on the worker (can't really be rescheduled). Therefore I could pivot to modifying the `DataflowTemplateOperator`  however this would require significant refactoring of that hook which assumes you always want to block while waiting. I can address this in a subsequent PR but it would be distracting here. The dataproc hook/operators will be a little cleaner to refactor to show a usage of `BaseAsyncOperator` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/537697927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/537699582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6246#issuecomment-537699582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6246","id":537699582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzY5OTU4Mg==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-02T21:58:41Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T21:58:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a change in the code.

Your `InitContainer` only implements a small portion of the full `kubernetes.client.models.V1Container`and requires additional code to convert to the appropriate object. This should lower the complexity and increase the functionality of this PR significantly. The old Airflow Kubernetes objects are only there for backwards compatibility API reasons.\r\n\r\n@davlum Thanks for your review on this PR. I would like some clarification on your comment. \r\n1. When you say old Airflow Kubernetes objects, do you mean the custom objects such as: `Secret`, `VolumeMount`, `Volume`,..?\r\n2.

But since API is experimental - better to do it now, then never.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/538399007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/538405316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6243#issuecomment-538405316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6243","id":538405316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODQwNTMxNg==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-04T13:50:26Z","updated_at":"2019-10-04T13:51:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@feluelle Can you look at this agian?

Testing and monitoring it for further refinement. I will update the code for this PR and AIP document with the overall structure and some statistics based on our testing for the past several weeks. \r\n\r\n@BasPH @feng-tao, Thanks for your feedbacks. It's my bad not update this PR on time. \r\nThe smart sensor operator itself is only used to create a control dag for taking over all sensors in the airflow cluster when the cluster is enable to \"use_smart_sensor\" by configuration. The smart sensor task is running as a service keep refreshing all active sensor tasks from DB and poking them. Users doesn't need to change their original sensor tasks when writing DAGs. \r\n\r\nWhen use smart sensor, the sensor tasks state changing is different with regular sensor. The scheduler will persist sensor's poke context to DB and set the state to \"Smart_pending\" so that the task will not be queued and taking a separate process in any worker. Smart sensor task instance which is a long running process on the work will refresh DB to get all sensors that are in \"Smart\" state (smart_running or smart_pending) and poke them. If the poke return True it will set the corresponding task_instance state to \"success\" so that the scheduler will be able to kick off the downstream task_instance in the next parsing loop. There is only a cluster configuration change for using smart sensor. No need to write DAGs in a different way. I will update the PR and the description with latest change and also update the AIP to include all details for smart sensor design.
