Here is instruction\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n1. Add rule visitors in `MySQLVisitor.java` based on g4 files[1].\r\n2. Check whether rule name in g4 files is appropriate or not.\r\n3. Add parsed integrated test for your **new main rule visitor**.\r\n\r\n### Task details\r\n1. Add rule visitors\r\n* Since `MySQLVisitor.java` extends `MySQLStatementBaseVisitor<ASTNode>.java`, you should overwrite `visitRuleName(ctx)` from `MySQLStatementBaseVisitor<ASTNode>` referring to rules in g4 files.\r\n* When adding `visitRuleName(ctx)`, you should put it below the corresponding note generally named `xxx.g4` and keep its order same with where it is in `xxx.g4` file.\r\n* What we need after parsing is those classes implement `SQLStatemnt` interface, so you should parse all necessary rules (add necessary rule visitors) making up `the main rules` in `MySQLStatement.g4`, and then fill necessary `segments` to `xxxSQLStatemnt`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Check rule name\r\n* If we do not care one rule (do not add visitor for it), its name should end up with `_` in g4 file. For instance, we do not add visitor for `IDENTIFIER_` in `baseRule.g4`.\r\n* Otherwise this rule name should not contain `_` in the end.\r\n* If existing rule name does not accord with the above rules, please fix it.\r\n\r\n3. Add parsed integrated test\r\nWhen you successfully add `one main rule visitor`, adding parsed integrated test for it is necessary.\r\n* Copy sql case you need from `./incubator-shardingsphere/sharding-sql-test/src/main/resources/sql/sharding/` to `./incubator-shardingsphere/sharding-sql-test/src/main/resources/sql/visitor/` (Please note to keep the same directory). \r\n* Copy the corresponding sql parsed result from `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sharding/` to ` ./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/visitor/` (Please note to keep the same directory).\r\n* Run `org.apache.shardingsphere.sql.parser.integrate.engine.visitor.VisitorParameterizedParsingTest`.\r\n* If there is no sql case you need in `./incubator-shardingsphere/sharding-sql-test/src/main/resources/sql/sharding/`, please record it to this issue[2]. P.S, my suggestion is to easily test its parsed result previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n1. Current functions in `org.apache.shardingsphere.sql.parser.MySQLVisitor` could provide examples for you.\r\n2. You could learn more about the parsed integrated test from test entrance `org.apache.shardingsphere.sql.parser.integrate.engine.visitor.VisitorParameterizedParsingTest`. \r\n\r\n### Notice\r\n1. This guideline applies to `OracleVisitor`, `PostrgreSQLVisitor`, `SQLServerVisitor` and `SQL92Visitor` as well.\r\n\r\n[1] DALStatement.g4, DCLStatement.g4, DDLStatement.g4, DMLStatement.g4, TCLStatement.g4 and StoreProcedure.g4\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/issues/3967","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/574108748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/574157270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3922#issuecomment-574157270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3922","id":574157270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDE1NzI3MA==","user":{"login":"SteNicholas","id":10048174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDQ4MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10048174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas","html_url":"https://github.com/SteNicholas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T12:45:41Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T12:45:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> agree with @SteNicholas metadata should be a infrastructure service for ShardingSphere, we should provide a uniform interface for initialization, read, refreshing instead of distinguish with whether sharding or not. it seems that it will be a big refactor for sharding-jdbc & sharding-proxy.\r\n> assume that task list is as below\r\n> \r\n> * [ ]  investigate the usage of current metadata, clarify the function list of metadata (SQLParse, Route,Rewrite etc)\r\n> * [ ]  design a MetaData Model & MetaData Sevice, at first only consider about storing in memory\r\n> * [ ]  then consider about migrating to zookeeper or other registration\r\n> \r\n> @terrymanu is it ok for that\r\n\r\n@cherrylzhao Could u please send dev email group for discussion of this problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/574157270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/574212590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/3959#issuecomment-574212590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3959","id":574212590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDIxMjU5MA==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T14:56:40Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T14:56:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, I am still want ask the same question.
