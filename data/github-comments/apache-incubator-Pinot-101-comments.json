The only difference I see is, I'm using AVRO where the gitHubEvents example uses JSON.\r\n> \r\n> Maybe you wanna have a look at this as well, but I guess this ticket can be closed. Thanks to all for supporting me here, I'll continue my test with Pinot.\r\n\r\nWe are able to use it directly in that example, because the `complexTypeConfig` has been set. Before `complexTypeConfig` feature was developed, we would use the transform configs like in my example above. Those transform configs have been well tested now, and used by many people, hence I felt it was the best way for you to move forward. The `complexTypeConfig` is a very new feature, so there might be some minor issues in documentation/support that we need to iron out. Will let @yupeng9 comment on whether your use-case could have been achieved using the complex config, and what's the right config to set for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/898635978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/898640282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7262#issuecomment-898640282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7262","id":898640282,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41kCma","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-13T18:19:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T18:19:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Oh one more point,\r\n> \r\n> what I also was not able to accomplish is using the default value for my date time field.

TIMESTAMP is a relatively new addition. \r\nWe have a restriction in Pinot for time column range as rightly pointed out by the message `must be between: 1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z/2071-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`. So the default value for TIMESTAMP should not be `0`. \r\n@Jackie-Jiang can you check regarding the `TIMESTAMP` default value?

Are you looking for a no downtime move?\r\nI think we should have a no-downtime solution for this.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of deep store access patterns:\r\n1. From the controller, typically the segments are stored on the controller, either local or mounted remote disk(NAS/ EBS/...)\r\n2. Direct from remote store, e.g. s3/hdfs/webhdfs/gcs/adls/etc\r\n\r\nSo there are four scenarios:\r\nA. Type I -> Type I:\r\nIf we want to switch to a big disk instance, then just bring down one controller instance, rsync all the disk from old to new controller instance then update segment metadata download URL with new instance host.\r\n\r\nB. Type I -> Type II:\r\nIf we want to achieve no downtime migration, pinot controller needs to handle the migration from deep store first, so all new segments are using new deep store download uris. meanwhile clients can also download segments from the controller with old download URIs.\r\n\r\nThe gap here is that we should allow users to configure multiple deep stores and read/write from them.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7302 is a prerequisite.\r\n\r\nC. Type II -> Type I:\r\nPlease think twice and don't do it.\r\n\r\nD. Type II -> Type II:\r\nThis is simple, We can achieve this right now by:\r\n- Loop all segments for all the tables\r\n- Download segment and copy to the new deep store (keep relevant path)\r\n- Update the download URI in the segment metadata.\r\n\r\nI think overall we need to:\r\n- Implement a gap feature https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7302\r\n- Implement a premitive of API to download segment  from current download URI and upload to new location then update download URL","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/898986667/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/898988206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7268#issuecomment-898988206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7268","id":898988206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41lXiu","user":{"login":"pjpringle","id":22993010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTkzMDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22993010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle","html_url":"https://github.com/pjpringle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjpringle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-15T03:06:17Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T03:06:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We did find a work around; when adding a metric in superset you can enter custom sql such as \"sum(val) option(skipUpsert=true)\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/898988206/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/898993065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7303#issuecomment-898993065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7303","id":898993065,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41lYup","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-15T04:18:21Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T04:18:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We were not able to do that unfortunately..

a good idea to add a config to disable groovy scripts in SQL statements. However, we should survey the use cases and the usage model on deciding the default value (ON vs OFF). I vote for keeping the current behavior and only disabling it when explicitly specified. My reasoning is that the more common case is not prone to this issue:\r\n\r\n- Most Pinot deployments do not expose a free form SQL endpoint to their external users. Almost in all cases, the SQL is generated within the org that is running Pinot.\r\n- Typically, there's a data model between external user and the data store. Most such attacks would be stopped right by the data model by not allowing any way for user to create such a SQL query.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/899851895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/899857667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7308#issuecomment-899857667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7308","id":899857667,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41or0D","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-16T22:24:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T01:34:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7308?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7308](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7308?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f51be0f) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/50884b756f0b5e9a12e4196e5e6f06098f511ff4?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (50884b7) will **decrease** coverage by `6.69%`.\n> The diff coverage is `59.11%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head f51be0f differs from pull request most recent head b870521.

In cases like these, one could set a warning in query results and try to quantify how accurate the results might be (i.e result is based on responses of 9 out of 11 segments, etc). \r\n\r\n> I don't see how this kind of problem is different from exceptions though.

The problem with throwing exception is that it is commonly used for error conditions, tends to be thrown arbitrarily at times so one can't usually distinguish between warning and errors, and requires special handling similar to errors conditions, so users would end up treating warnings as exceptions. Even in case of approximate functions such as  DISTINCTCOUNTHLL it may be a good idea to set a warning saying that results are approximate and not definite.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/900038286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/900089293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7313#issuecomment-900089293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7313","id":900089293,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41pkXN","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-17T08:12:43Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T08:12:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are right, this should be Good status, @shahsank3t ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/900089293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/900094256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7311#issuecomment-900094256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7311","id":900094256,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41plkw","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-17T08:19:52Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T07:15:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7311?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7311](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7311?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (4ec7b09) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/107255a9e681c8c563be211e4c2b6c9787534723?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (107255a) will **decrease** coverage by `40.57%`.\n> The diff coverage is `36.25%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 4ec7b09 differs from pull request most recent head 38eeb24.
