\nTrusting DB as the source of truth is the root of cause of this issue actually .....\nAs I mentioned in https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/1085\nIf the concurrency is implemented by checking how many running task instances in database, which means it's possible all tasks can start running at the same time because when they query the database, they all get a count of 0.\n\nAnd I'm wondering how the executor's state can get out of sync? By multiple schedulers?.\n\nMaybe a better solution is using curator/zookeeper's semaphore to solve this problem(each of the task get a resource from the semaphore).\n\nIn summary, simply counting the number of running tasks can lead to concurrency issues when multiple task_instance is checking the database at the same time.

That could probably be done now with PythonOperator/HiveCliHook.run_cli and EmailOperator.\n@r39132 is right that in returning a full query result will often be impractical/impossible from a performance perspective.  The xcom system is designed for return values, not datasets\n@bolkedebruin brings up the interesting idea of returning result handles much like Luigi does it.  It would probably make the Airflow batch system more flexible to orient jobs around arbitrary resource handles instead of only execution dates like it is now.  Some issues with this proposal:\n- The creation of a resource handle would have to be implemented one-by-one for each operator.  For HiveOperator it might be tricky to identify the precise output if the supplied HQL consists of multiple queries.  Same for Pig scripts with multiple outputs.  For a PythonOperator we'd need a new convention for DAG authors to specify the output handles.\n- This output handle approach wouldn't do much for @hyperborea 's original use case. A simple \"select count(*)\" Hive query would probably return a handle to a temporary directory on HDFS\n\nIt seems to me we need two approaches:\n1. Create a new operator which executes a single-value Hive query and returns the value via xcom.  The operator raises an exception if the query returned multiple values.\n2. Existing operators should, where practical, be modified to return some sort of handle or handles to their output.  In the case of HiveOperator this might mean parsing the log for messages about updated tables or partitions.  Because some operators may update multiple destinations the returned handle may be a nested array.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/196730981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/196738405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1146#issuecomment-196738405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1146","id":196738405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjczODQwNQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T09:25:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T09:25:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dgies Not entirely: if a handler as a generic interface being it iterable or not it does not really matter if it is a \"select count(*)\" or a handle to a set of files.

It seems that this functionality could be implemented by skipping DAG Runs that are not the latest. Unfortunately, the current handling of \"Skipped\" is such that it is not compatible with `depends_on_past=True`. So, if we skipped a bunch of DAG Runs and if the DAG specified `depends_on_past=True`, the latest would never be queued. It seems that we first need the system to support `depends_on_past=True` for `skipped` tasks. \n\nThis is a major roadmap item and is tracked in
