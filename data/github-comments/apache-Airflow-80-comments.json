The output of the jobs will be parsed and the application_id is extracted from it. This only works when logging is set at `INFO` or lower, otherwise the concise and the application_id will not be emitted.\r\n- Adding the deploy-mode argument (also to the connection string) as this has become the default since Spark 2.0.\r\n\r\nI've added additional tests and refactored the code a bit. Let me know if it this is sufficient.\r\n\r\nFor a next pr I would like to add an abstract class for both the spark-{submit, sql} class, and also refactor the spark-sql operator to work with the Airflow connections.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/282284860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/282336862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2103#issuecomment-282336862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2103","id":282336862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjMzNjg2Mg==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T16:32:16Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T16:32:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jakromm, thanks for your PR!
