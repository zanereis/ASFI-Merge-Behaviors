data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-247\"><del>CURATOR-247</del></a> Extend Curator's connection state to support SESSION_LOST</p>\n\n<p>    This is a significant change. Please review carefully and let's have a lot of discussion. Because the new behavior is so much better (and more consistent with expectations) <strong>I've enabled it by default</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>    Major differences from the older behavior are:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Session/connection timeouts are no longer managed by the low-level client. They are managed by the CuratorFramework instance. There should be no noticeable differences.</li>\n\t<li>Prior to 3.0.0, each iteration of the retry policy would allow the connection timeout to elapse if the connection hadn't yet succeeded. This meant that the true connection timeout was the configured value times the maximum retries in the retry policy. This longstanding issue has been address. Now, the connection timeout can elapse only once for a single API call.</li>\n\t<li>MOST IMPORTANTLY! Prior to 3.0.0, ConnectionState.LOST did not imply a lost session (much to the confusion of users). Now, Curator will set the LOST state only when it believes that the ZooKeeper session has expired. ZooKeeper connections have a session. When the session expires, clients must take appropriate action. In Curator, this is complicated by the fact that Curator internally manages the ZooKeeper connection. Now, Curator will set the LOST state when any of the following occurs: a) ZooKeeper returns a Watcher.Event.KeeperState.Expired or KeeperException.Code.SESSIONEXPIRED; b) Curator closes the internally managed ZooKeeper instance; c) The configured session timeout elapses during a network partition.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    Something important to consider. Given the significance of this change it makes to have it be part of 3.0.0 but if we merge it into 3.0.0 now it will be harder to maintain master and 3.0.0 as separate branches. Some git expertise is needed here on how to manage this.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-247\" title=\"Extend Curator&#39;s connection state to support SESSION_LOST\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-247\"><del>CURATOR-247</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/97.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/97.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #97</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 344634ac6e34e61bc0cc7b41923a1df4089c7948<br/>\nAuthor: randgalt <randgalt@apache.org><br/>\nDate:   2015-08-21T17:10:24Z</p>\n\n<p>    First pass at new (optional) definition of state LOST</p>\n\n<p>commit 2343daf29388566b0efa0b0a2ad21574fb534a27<br/>\nAuthor: randgalt <randgalt@apache.org><br/>\nDate:   2015-08-21T20:11:59Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge branch '<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-3\" title=\"LeaderLatch race condition causing extra nodes to be added in Zookeeper Edit\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-3\"><del>CURATOR-3</del></a>.0' into <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-247\" title=\"Extend Curator&#39;s connection state to support SESSION_LOST\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-247\"><del>CURATOR-247</del></a></p>\n\n<p>commit 62f3c33cdb556eccf6fe1cc87ee74b3458431777<br/>\nAuthor: randgalt <randgalt@apache.org><br/>\nDate:   2015-08-21T22:35:44Z</p>\n\n<p>    Continued work on new LOST behavior.

The unit test may not work every time due to race conditions. After your post above I made a few more tests to confirm the issue. Surprisingly, there was one case where the test failed (i.e. the issue did not occur and the program behaved correctly). I suspect the actual outcome depends on the ordering of client 0/1's actions. This discovery may make it more difficult to create a proper unit test for this issue.</p>\n\n\n<p>17:37:01: 1 trying to enter<br/>\n17:37:01: 0 trying to enter<br/>\n17:37:02: 1

Looking at https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/master/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L241\nas a result of your change of not putting them in the services map wouldn't that mean they cannot be unregistered at all?\nAlso the current implementation of unregistration means that services cannot be unregistered using a different servicediscovery instance than they were registered with, which would be very useful with permanent service types.\n\nNote: As a user, I think not being able to update permanent servicetypes could easily be worked around by unregistering and reregistering them with the new
