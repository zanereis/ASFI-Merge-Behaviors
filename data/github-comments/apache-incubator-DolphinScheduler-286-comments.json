Currently, because of those `powermock`, I could not give an exact estimate of the specific workload. If we decide to do so, first of all, we need to remove all the code related to powermock #11405 . Then, we need to get back to this PR to add dependency on jUnit5 and manually migrate the complex part which IDE could not do automatically e.g. change `expected = Exception.class` to `Assertions.assertThrows`. After these two done, we could try to use `Intellij` to migrate the rest and see how many of the rest will break and decide what to do next.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1214702962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1214717698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11360#issuecomment-1214717698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11360","id":1214717698,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5IZx8C","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-15T07:46:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T07:46:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This
