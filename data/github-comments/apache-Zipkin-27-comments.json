so we had some caching issues come up again recently (#718). One thing we've not done is tested things like caching headers from zipkin-web. (ex they are tested on zipkin-query as finatra is a testable framework). Note I'm not trying to discuss cache specifically here, just calling out that zipkin-web is hard to test.\n\nI'm wondering if UI refactoring could get us to a place where we could mount static assets on top of zipkin-query itself? Ex. zipkin-web is simply zipkin-query + static assets. That would allow us to not have to do any routing, which should help performance, and also allow us to inherit any tested configuration, such as cache headers on the api.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/184969420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/184972817","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/718#issuecomment-184972817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/718","id":184972817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDk3MjgxNw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T01:57:16Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T01:57:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To summarize status quo, the query server sends back a cache header when there are more than 3 services present:\n\n``` scala\nassert(response.headerMap.get(\"Cache-Control\") == Some(\"max-age=300, must-revalidate\"))\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-query/src/test/scala/com/twitter/zipkin/query/ZipkinQueryServerFeatureTest.scala#L167\n\nThe actual age is assigned via the flag \"zipkin.queryService.servicesMaxAge\", which is incidentally not currently mapped as an environment variable.\n\nThe zipkin-web server _should_ forward this header all the way to javascript (or any other caller).

I doubt that the supporting UIs require modification to the services they serve. Ex I doubt someone changed S3 bucket api to cache in support of AWS console, although S3 bucket list is quite a fast api anyway! I tend to see refresh buttons on UIs.. but I'm sure there are other ways, too (ex buddy servers etc)\n\nIs there a way we can solve this lag problem without affecting the query server directly? I'd prefer us to not have the maintenance of special-casing certain endpoints due to rendering delays, if at all possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/185521817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/185523885","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/986#issuecomment-185523885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/986","id":185523885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTUyMzg4NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T03:13:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T03:13:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the help, eirik!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/185523885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/185525999","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/987#issuecomment-185525999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/987","id":185525999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTUyNTk5OQ==","user":{"login":"jcarres-mdsol","id":1803073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol","html_url":"https://github.com/jcarres-mdsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcarres-mdsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T03:27:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T03:27:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see. \nBecause ServiceA will already create a spanID before calling ServiceB. \nThen ServiceB just uses that spanID on SR/SS , creates a new spanID on CS/CR to next service and that one has a parentID which is sent to zipkin but it is **not** sent to the next service.

do you have suggestion on what the health endpoint should be checking?  I often see those implemented as `return OK`, which only tells the server is running, not that it's healthy. If we decide, for example, to include some db query in the health check, then it may require extending span storage api.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/187017654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/187051769","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/992#issuecomment-187051769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/992","id":187051769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NzA1MTc2OQ==","user":{"login":"abesto","id":59982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto","html_url":"https://github.com/abesto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abesto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T07:28:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T07:28:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sure, sounds fun.
