A query want to select some of the time series and these time series aren't present in most of the tsfiles.\r\n## Analyze\r\n1. For one tsfile\r\n     Suppose this tsfile contains 10000 timeseries, and each series has only one chunk in the file.\r\n     In this case, if we try to read a time series that not belong to the 10000 series, \r\n     (1) Without Bloom Filter, we have to read tsfile's FileMetadata and related TsDeviceMetadata, which costs 124ms;\r\n     (2) Using Bloom Filter, we just need to read  tsfile's FileMetadata (BF included), which costs 4ms.\r\n\r\n2. For iotdb\r\n\r\n    This analyze maybe very complex for iotdb has lru cache to cache chunk metadata. So when a query comes, for a specific tsfile there will be three possibilities. Let's say the time of loading metadata is t1, the time of using bloom filter is t2, the time of querying cache is t3, and cache and bloom filter will always hit.\r\n\r\n    Suppose all queried paths belong to the same device.\r\n\r\n## Three possibilities \r\n####   This tsfile contains all of the time series.\r\n\r\nTime with bloom filter = t3 + t2 + t1 + (n - 1) * t3\r\n\r\nTime without bloom filter = t3 + t1 + (n - 1) * t3\r\n\r\nOnce the data is loaded from disk (time cost: t1), the data will be cached. That's why time cost is (n - 1) * t3 for the query on 2nd ~ nth path.\r\n\r\noverhead : t2\r\n####   This tsfile contains k (>0) of the time series.\r\nSuppose the first queried path exists in the file.\r\nTime with bloom filter  = t3 + t2 + t1 +  (n - k) * (t3 + t2)  + (k - 1) * t3\r\n\r\nTime without bloom filter = t3 + t1 + (n - k) * (t3 + t1) + (k - 1 ) * t3\r\n\r\nsaving time : (n - k) * (t1 - t2)  - t2\r\n\r\n####    This tsfile contains none of the time series.\r\nTime with bloom filter  = n * (t3 + t2)\r\nTime without bloom filter = n * (t3 + t1)\r\nsaving time : n * (t1 - t2)\r\n\r\nAs we have tried t1 may >= 124ms, while t2 ~= 4ms, the improvement should be good.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/547905966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/548229137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/498#issuecomment-548229137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/498","id":548229137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODIyOTEzNw==","user":{"login":"jt2594838","id":23610645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEwNjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23610645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838","html_url":"https://github.com/jt2594838","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T06:04:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T06:04:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are failing tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/548229137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/548231043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/500#issuecomment-548231043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/500","id":548231043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODIzMTA0Mw==","user":{"login":"jt2594838","id":23610645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEwNjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23610645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838","html_url":"https://github.com/jt2594838","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T06:14:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T06:14:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please resolve the conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/548231043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/548711446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/506#issuecomment-548711446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/506","id":548711446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODcxMTQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"LeiRui","id":33376433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzc2NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33376433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiRui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiRui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-01T08:44:14Z","updated_at":"2019-11-01T08:44:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good feature, but I wonder how to write such a query.

What about just disabling the `getDatabaseProductVersion()` method by throw an exception? Since the now returned result `VERSION` is meaningless anyway and this method is not used anywhere.\r\n3.

`statement.execute(sql)` instead of `databaseMetaData.getColumns`.\r\n> By the way, please help rename `showTimeseriesTest1` to `showTimeseriesTest` for clarity.\r\n\r\nDone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/549015342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/549020590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/507#issuecomment-549020590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/507","id":549020590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTAyMDU5MA==","user":{"login":"liukun4515","id":7450163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTAxNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7450163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515","html_url":"https://github.com/liukun4515","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liukun4515/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-02T07:56:21Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T07:56:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"why
