I think the preference is to simply get the working code into HEAD and then if there are remaining issues fix them on the path to the 0.6 release.  But I certainly wouldn't object either way.\n\nRegarding the R directory - yes.  There's a light R package created here to handle the R side of scala-R communication.  I felt that it was better to put that in a local `R/` directory than to try to install it in the user's or system's R library.  That's the design choice made in Spark itself, so I tried to match that. \n\nRegarding SPARK_HOME, yes and yes.  To talk to spark, R has to have a version of the SparkR R package that matches the running version of Spark.  That lives under the `R/` subdirectory of the spark binary home, in the spark distribution.  So at startup, we need to know where the current spark binary is, so we can load the correct SparkR package.  (We could _try_ to run without confirming the version, but in practice this generated support issues without a corresponding benefit.)  \n\nWhy always SPARK_HOME and not to try to look for an R under a spark subdirectory of Zeppelin?  Because it turned out that doing that generated a torrent of support issues that arose when the user had an inconsistent Spark configuration or was running with a version of Spark other than the one they compiled against.  Part of the reason for this is that which spark installation gets used, actually is not completely defined by Zeppelin, and its changed more times than I think folks realize, including unintentionally.  (For example, compare the way the pyspark interpreter and SparkInterpreter try to locate Spark.)  Requiring that SPARK_HOME be set produces the only un-ambiguous configuration.  My understanding, from correspondence with Moon in August/September, is that spark-under-zeppelin is effectively deprecated, partly for this reason, and will soon be removed, so that Zeppelin always and only launches spark from SPARK_HOME.  So to simplify admin and the user experience, the interpreter requires SPARK_HOME, checks for it, and noisily declines to connect to spark if it isn't set. \n\nSo, to sum up -- there are a couple relevant `R/` directories.  One is part of the spark distribution and contains the SparkR package for connecting R to the correct version of Spark.  There is an analogous one created for the R interpreter, under ZEPPELIN_HOME, for the rzeppelin package, which handles the R side of the Zeppelin-R interface.  During startup, we force loading these packages from those directories so we load the correct versions.  \n\n@bzz Thank you for the reminder!  I'll take care of it in the next day or so.

work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/189673562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/189678092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/753#issuecomment-189678092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/753","id":189678092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTY3ODA5Mg==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-27T16:23:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-27T16:23:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

\n\nYes, **Cassandra** is supported on Windows.\n\nThe error is about parsing multi line comments. The first test failure looks interesting. Basically it says that the following test fails:\n\n``` scala\n  \"Parser\" should \"parse multi-line comment\" in {\n    val query:String =\n      \"\"\"/*This is a comment\n        |line1\n        |line2\n        |line3\n        |*/\n      \"\"\".stripMargin\n\n    val parsed = parser.parseAll(parser.multiLineComment, query)\n    parsed should matchPattern {\n      case parser.Success(Comment(\"This is a comment\\nline1\\nline2\\nline3\\n\"), _) =>\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nbecause it does not match the regexp pattern: `(?s)/\\*(.*)\\*/` e.g:\n- (?s) = **[DOT ALL mode](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#DOTALL)**\n- \\\\* = start with `\\*`\n- (.*) = any character\n- */ = end with `*/`\n\nI'm wondering if it is not related to the difference between Linux/Unix and Windows for the **[line terminator](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/426397/do-line-endings-differ-between-windows-and-linux)**\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/189872676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/189873259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/734#issuecomment-189873259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/734","id":189873259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTg3MzI1OQ==","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-28T13:37:01Z","updated_at":"2016-02-28T13:37:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let

The First one is easy of use. User need to repeat paragraph id to series of z.angularBind() again and again. e.g.\n\n``` javascript\nz.angularBind('name1', value1, { paragraph : '20160126-153136_1060166247'})\nz.angularBind('name2', value2, { paragraph : '20160126-153136_1060166247'})\nz.angularBind('name3', value3, { paragraph : '20160126-153136_1060166247'})\n...\n```\n\nSecond one is notebook portability, the code now depends on paragraph id and it's not portable anymore.

Indeed, what's the point to bind an Angular variable if you don't **refresh** immediately the target paragraph for quick update ? I can't see any use-case where the user bind an Angular variable and do not click on the \"Run\" button on the target paragraph(s) or on the whole notebook itself.\n\nIf we remove the `runParagraph` option, to achieve the same feature, we'll need:\n\n``` html\n\n<input type=\"text\" ng-click=\"z.angularBind(....); z.runParagraph(...)\" >\n```\n\n or worst, the user should manually click on the target paragraph like in the screenshot, it's far from being user-friendly.\n\n> I think it can be improved by considering two perspective. The First one is easy of use. User need to repeat paragraph id to series of z.angularBind() again and again. e.g.\n\nI do agree with your on this point to some extent. Yes, it forces the user to do a manual copy and paste but once it's done, you don't need to update it again (we'll see this point below).\n\nBut this issue also applies to `ZeppelinContext.runParagraph(String paragraphId)` if we had chosen to use the ZeppelinContext to run paragraphs in the back-end instead of front-end so I would say this issue is not really a new issue, it has always been there.\n\n> Second one is notebook portability, the code now depends on paragraph id and it's not portable anymore. If you export notebook and import notebook, the code will not work anymore unless user update all paragraph id in the code.\n\nYou are absolutely right about this point. Indeed it's vey annoying that exporting and importing the same note make you loose the paragraph id. For this I see 2 solutions:\n1. first create the Angular `z` object from an HtmlElement as you suggest `var z = getZeppelinContext(htmlElement)`, the only problem is what is `htmlElement` ? How can we refer to a paragraph by its `htmlElement` ? I find it simpler to refer to a paragraph using its **id**     \n2. **I think we should fix the dynamic paragraph id and persist the paragraph id at the same time as the paragraph content**. As far as I can see, the paragraph id is generated using some timestamp plus a random part so there is very few chance of collision. Consequently it is possible to export a note with all the original paragraph ids and import them elsewhere\n   \n   WDYT ? \n\n> front-end z.angularBind() call creates/updates angularObject into all interpreters binded.\n\nAllow me to disagree with this idea, if there are 10 paragraphs in the note with 10 different interpreters, it will create a lot of **pollution**. There is no reason that we push the Angular variable to many interpreters that are not used by the target paragraph(s).\n\nAnother argument against binding the variable to all interpreters used by the note is because Angular variables are **persisted** in `note.json` file so we'll create a lot of data that will be exported/re-imported and not used ....\n\n> Could you explain advantage of having API in both front-end and back-end side ?\n\nYes, this is part of the goal **Usability Improvement** in the roadmap.\n\nAs an user, I want to be able to design a custom (with my own CSS etc ...) HTML form with my own controls (input text, drop down, calendar component, carrousel etc ...) and be able to push Angular variable to back-end.\n\nWithout this PR, to do this, I'll need to write Scala code like \n\n``` scala\nimport org.apache.zeppelin.display.angular.paragraphscope._\nimport AngularElem._\n\n<div>\n  <div class=\"alert alert-info\">This is an alert panel</div>\n  <form class=\"form-inline\">\n    <div class=\"form-group\">\n      <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\"  placeholder=\"Input Text\"></input>\n    </div>\n    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Click Me</button>\n  </form>\n</div>.onEvent(\"ng-click\", () => {\n  //my callback routine\n}).display\n```\n\n If I were a web developer using Zeppelin, **I don't understand why I am forced to use Scala and the Spark interpreter to produce AngularJS and HTML source code**... \n\nIsn't it more natural to write **plain Javascript and AngularJS code** if you want to render HTML and bind AngularJS ?\n\n I have given many talks about Zeppelin since 6 months and everytime I build a beautiful pure HTML form using Bootstrap, people in the audience ask me why I have another paragraph with source code like this:\n\n``` scala\n\nz.angularBind(...)\nz.runParagraph(...)\n```\n\n It seems so un-natural for users to have Scala code in a separate paragraph just to make the HTML form work. If we want to extend the user-base of Zeppelin, we need to provide user natural ways of creating Angular variable and not force them to use the Spark interpreter for that.\n\n There is also a demande on the user-mailing list recently to be able to update Angular variable from the front-end:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/13409353/55a4c728-df3b-11e5-877c-0c2ec387a4a8.png)\n\n So the demand for controlling Angular variable from the front-end is real, not just some fancy idea I have in mind.\n\n> Cons side, if user creates something that mixes both front-end side API and back-end side API at the same time, while front-end side(js in webbrowser) and back-end side (heterogeneous interpreters) runs asynchronously, i can easily imagine understanding behavior of those code will be really difficult.\n\n  Totally agree that if one user try to bind AngularJS using the back-end API with ZeppelinContext or the new Angular API you introduce and the front-end API I propose, it will make things complicated. But again, it's the user responsibility to make clean code. You can never stop people from doing stupid things right ? \n\nTo conclude, what I propose is to make another PR, before we progress on this one, **to persist the paragraph Id with the note content** so that we don't have anymore export/import problem. \n\n WDYT

Indeed, what's the point to bind an Angular variable if you don't refresh immediately the target paragraph for quick update ? I can't see any use-case where the user bind an Angular variable and do not click on the \"Run\" button on the target paragraph(s) or on the whole notebook itself.\n> \n> If we remove the runParagraph option, to achieve the same feature, we'll need:\n> \n> ```\n> <input type=\"text\" ng-click=\"z.angularBind(....); z.runParagraph(...)\" >\n> ```\n> \n> or worst, the user should manually click on the target paragraph like in the screenshot, it's far from being user-friendly.\n\nIdea behind AngularDisplaySystem was, give possibility to interpreter (back-end) interact with front-end. By leveraging two way binding and watcher of AngularJS, AngularDisplaySystem could able to work without introducing any Zeppelin API in front-end side.\n\nCurrent api is designed like\n\n| Actions | Front-end API | Back-end API |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Initiate binding | N/A | z.angularBind(var, initialValue) |\n| Update value | same to ordinary angularjs scope variable | z.angularBind(var, newValue) |\n| Watching value | same to ordinary angularjs scope variable | z.angularWatch(var, (oldVal, newVal) => ) |\n| Destroy binding | N/A | z.angularUnbind(var) |\n\nin my understanding, this PR trying to change it, to\n\n| Actions | Front-end API | Back-end API |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Initiate binding | z.angularbind(var, initialValue) | z.angularBind(var, initialValue) |\n| Update value | same to ordinary angularjs scope variable, or z.angularBind(var, newValue) | z.angularBind(var, newValue) |\n| Watching value | same to ordinary angularjs scope variable | z.angularWatch(var, (oldVal, newVal) => ) |\n| Destroy binding | z.angularUnbind(var) | z.angularUnbind(var) |\n\nIn this perspective, i'm not sure it's good to embed run paragraph inside of z.angularBind() function in front-end side, while corresponding api in backend side does not.\n\nAlso not every case uses angular displays system to let user click and run other paragraph.\nAngular display system can be used to dynamically update front-end without re-run the paragraph like this example https://gist.github.com/granturing/a09aed4a302a7367be92.\n\nSo, to me, it's less ambiguous and more consistent to have two apis. z.angularBind() and z.runParagraph().\n\n#### passing paragraph id.\n\n> But this issue also applies to ZeppelinContext.runParagraph(String paragraphId) if we had chosen to use the ZeppelinContext to run paragraphs in the back-end instead of front-end so I would say this issue is not really a new issue, it has always been there.\n\nRight, if user use just hardcoded paragraph id to call existing `ZeppelinContext.runParagraph(String paragraphId)` then the problem will be there. However, current API set provides option to write code without hardcoded paragraph id.\n\n```\nz.runParagraph(z.getInterpreterContext.getParagraphId)\n```\n\nIn the similar manner, \n\n```\n<div id=\"myEl\"></div>\n<script>\nvar htmlElement = angular.element('#myEl')\nvar z = getZeppelinContext(htmlElement)\n...\n</script>\n```\n\nwill give an option to avoid use hardcoded paragraph id.\nhtmlElement is html Element that created by user code in the paragraph.\nThat's only way i know get current paragraph id from the javascript that defined in particular paragraph.\n\n> I think we should fix the dynamic paragraph id and persist the paragraph id at the same time as the paragraph content. As far as I can see, the paragraph id is generated using some timestamp plus a random part so there is very few chance of collision. Consequently it is possible to export a note with all the original paragraph ids and import them elsewhere\n\nparagraph id can not be simply changed, while of some features (rest api to run paragraph, iframe link, ...) and a lot of internal code (angulardisplay system, job scheduler, etc) assumes paragraph id is immutable.  \n\n#### front-end z.angularBind() call creates/updates angularObject into all interpreters binded.\n\n> Allow me to disagree with this idea, if there are 10 paragraphs in the note with 10 different interpreters, it will create a lot of pollution. There is no reason that we push the Angular variable to many interpreters that are not used by the target paragraph(s).\n> \n> Another argument against binding the variable to all interpreters used by the note is because Angular variables are persisted in note.json file so we'll create a lot of data that will be exported/re-imported and not used ....\n\nRight, that's what i wanted to say actually :-)\n\n#### Advantage of having API in both front-end, back-end side\n\n> There is also a demande on the user-mailing list recently to be able to update Angular variable from the front-end:\n> ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/13409353/55a4c728-df3b-11e5-877c-0c2ec387a4a8.png)\n> So the demand for controlling Angular variable from the front-end is real, not just some fancy idea I have in mind.\n\nThe question from the mailing list, \"pass variable defined in a angular interpreter to another paragraph which is scala interpreter\", i can convert it to \"how to initiate angularObject binding from the front-end code?\" Because passing variable from front end to back end is already possible once they're binded.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/191504454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/191547114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/755#issuecomment-191547114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/755","id":191547114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTU0NzExNA==","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T02:25:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T02:25:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo that sounds like more appropriate approach. @karup1990 what do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/191547114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/191586566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/757#issuecomment-191586566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/757","id":191586566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTU4NjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T05:06:59Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T05:06:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CI failing is irrelevant.

What I want is that **on Import, we keep the original paragraph id** and don't generate a new one every time so that `z.angularBind('val', val, {paragraphId: 'xxxx'})`  is re-usable and does not break when sharing or importing/exporting notes\n\n To enable this behavior, **there is very few change to the code base**, see the diff **[here](https://gist.github.com/doanduyhai/350ddf29cedd4ca37f45)**\n\nThe result seems working well with import/export and clone\n\n![testimport-export_clone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/13501070/db0a023c-e16d-11e5-97d3-d2c105d04f14.gif)\n\n> Right, that's what i wanted to say actually :-)\n\n So there is no problem, we both agree that `z.angularBind()` should **bind value to only one paragraph** right ?\n\n>  i can convert it to \"how to initiate angularObject binding from the front-end code?\" Because passing variable from front end to back end is already possible once they're binded.\n\n Exactly, so `z.angularBind()` is here to fill in the gap and allow to initiate a new binding to an Angular variable from front-end.\n\n<hr/>\n\n So to conclude, we indeed agree on many things. I propose the following next steps:\n1. Rework this PR to remove `runParagraph` so we decouple `z.angularBind()` and `z.runParagrap()`\n2. Create another PR to keep the original paragraph id every time we import a note, based on the patch I showed\n\nWDYT @Leemoonsoo
