When `push` to `master` branch, it'll occur when merging PR into master branch. Refer to [events-that-trigger-workflows#push]( https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push ) for more details.\r\n\r\nAll of these scenarios are improved.\r\n\r\n1, Scenario 1: `pull_request` triggered workflow\r\n\r\nWorkflows triggered by `pull_request` are isolated by PR number (via concurrency group). Effects:\r\n- When PR2 is opened, it will **NOT** cancel PR1's workflow\r\n- In every PR, e.g. PR2, if there're more commit and push after PR opened, then it'll cancel previous workflow. e.g. in PR 14776,  after I commit 06fafd6 and push it, I commit 85cce8b  and push it immediately, 06fafd6 triggered workflow is cancelled, screenshot:\r\n<img width=\"918\" alt=\"图片\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42492540/150049303-2bc87e24-34fc-4762-9760-2ea29ffe2700.png\">\r\n\r\n2, Scenario 2: `push` triggered workflow\r\n\r\nWorkflows triggered by `push` are isolated by branch (via concurrency gruop). Effect:\r\n- If several PRs are merged quickly, e.g. PR1, PR2, PR3, then 1) when PR2 merged, PR1 push triggered workflow will be cancelled, 2) when PR3 merged, PR2 push triggered workflow will be cancelled, 3) current active workflow is PR3 push triggered.

For example: in table t_users include id,name,pwd column,the pwd is a encrypt column. when sql is select id ,name ,CONCAT(name,pwd) as val from t_user; getValue(val) find this column(val) is not a columnProject . and the express is \"CONCAT(name,pwd)\" include pwd is a encrypt.
