Basically, all user classes are loaded from a user classpath, which includes the user jars/dirs. If classes aren't found, there is a whitelist of system-level classes that will be searched. This list should be as short as possible and it typically includes the framework classes (e.g., Heron API) and some very low level core classes like javax and logging. This is similar to what servlet containers do for user classpath isolation, while providing access to framework classes.\r\n\r\nNote that this class loader logic is reversed from the default classloader logic, which is to first check the parent loader, then check the current loader.\r\n\r\nThis is the trunk version of ApplicationClassLoader:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/ApplicationClassLoader.java\r\n\r\nThe default system classes definition:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/resources/org.apache.hadoop.application-classloader.properties","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/284048676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/284085852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1735#issuecomment-284085852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1735","id":284085852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDA4NTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-03T22:18:23Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T22:18:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Example usage:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/RunJar.java\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/YarnChild.java\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/284085852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/284098826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1744#issuecomment-284098826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1744","id":284098826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDA5ODgyNg==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-03T23:25:42Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T23:25:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, still investigating the root cause of the behavior I'm seeing.
