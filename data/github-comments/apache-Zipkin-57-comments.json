Yes, weekend. Out of everyone, I least expected this from you.

right now, we have `zipkin.simplespan.SimpleSpan`\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to make a new package called zipkin2 and rename SimpleSpan to `zipkin2.Span` etc. If we did that, we'd have the artifact

Proposal: add span.kind = PRODUCER or CONSUMER\r\n\r\nwhen PRODUCER:\r\n  span.timestamp = the time the user produced the message\r\n  span.duration = if present, the delay between the user producing the message and it actually being sent\r\n\r\nwhen CONSUMER\r\n  span.timestamp = the time the consumer received the message\r\n  span.duration = if present, the processing delay (ex decoding it etc)\r\n\r\nIn Span2 model (#1499), this is straightforward. However, how we map these to annotations is really important especially as they can be used in single-host mode. Here's the idea:\r\n\r\n## Allocating PRODUCER or CONSUMER to annotations\r\n\r\nDefine \"ms\" and \"mr\", as discussed in #1243. Notably, these annotations are on separate endpoints, the producer and consumer respectively. Here's how to allocate span.kind = PRODUCER or CONSUMER to the span v1 model:\r\n\r\n* If PRODUCER\r\n  * if duration is unset or <1us, span.timestamp -> \"ms\"\r\n  * if duration is >=1us,  span.timestamp -> \"ms\", span.timestamp+duration -> \"ws\"\r\n\r\n* If CONSUMER\r\n  * if duration is unset or <1us, span.timestamp -> \"mr\"\r\n  * if duration is >=1us,  span.timestamp -> \"wr\", span.timestamp+duration -> \"mr\"\r\n\r\nMost importantly, unset span.timestamp and duration if allocating to annotations.\r\n\r\n## Examples:\r\n\r\nIn SPSC, the timeline is OK in both single-host spans, and potentially shared spans. in SPMC shared spans don't work anyway (each consumer needs to fork a span).\r\n\r\n### Sender and receiver have no queuing delay or knowledge of it.\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1L, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 3L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1L, ms, sender), (3L, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Receiver has some processing delay\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1L, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 2L, duration=1L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1L, ms, sender), (2L, wr, receiver), (3L, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Sender has some queuing delay\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1L, duration=1, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 3L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1L, ms, sender), (2L, ws, sender), (3L, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Both sides are delayed\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1L, duration=1, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 3L, duration = 1L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1L, ms, sender), (2L, ws, sender), (3L, wr, receiver), (4L, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Sender thinks it is a RPC client, receiver with queuing delay thinks it is a consumer\r\nspans: [kind = CLIENT, timestamp = 1L, duration=3L, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 2L, duration=20L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1L, cs, sender), (2L, wr, receiver), (3L, cr, sender), (22L, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Both sides have delay\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1L, service=sender], [kind = SERVER, timestamp = 2L, duration=1L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1L, cs, sender), (2L, sr, receiver), (3L, ss, receiver)]\r\n\r\n## Inconsistent instrumentation\r\nWhen one side thinks it is an RPC client or server, things look ok with some gotchas:\r\n\r\nWhen a sender in a shared span thinks it is a client, the critical path of span will not match cr-cs.\r\n  * this can be corrected at query time if the receiver is instrumented as a consumer (mr).\r\n\r\nWhen a receiver in a shared span thinks it is a server, (sr, ss) are at the end of the span, not the middle.\r\n  * this can be corrected at query time if the sender instrumented as a producer.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are some impacts, but mostly when both sides are instrumented incorrectly, eg both producer and consumer are mis-modeled as client and server. In the latter case, we can't do anything to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Sender thinks it is a RPC client, receiver thinks it is a consumer\r\nspans: [kind = CLIENT, timestamp = 1, duration=3, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 5, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1, cs, sender), (4, cr, sender), (5, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Sender thinks it is a RPC client, receiver with queuing delay thinks it is a consumer\r\nspans: [kind = CLIENT, timestamp = 1L, duration=3L, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 5L, duration=1L, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1, cs, sender), (4, cr, sender), (5, wr, receiver), (6L, mr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Sender thinks it is a Producer, receiver thinks it is an RPC server\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1, service=sender], [kind = CONSUMER, timestamp = 5L, duration=1, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1, ms, sender), (5L, sr, receiver), (5L, sr, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Sender with queuing delay thinks it is a Producer, receiver thinks it is an RPC server\r\nspans: [kind = PRODUCER, timestamp = 1, duration=3, service=sender], [kind = SERVER, timestamp = 5, duration=1, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1, ms, sender), (4, ws, sender), (5, sr, receiver), (6L, ss, receiver)]\r\n\r\n### Sender thinks it is a RPC client, receiver thinks it is a RPC server\r\nspans: [kind = CLIENT, timestamp = 1, duration=3, service=sender], [kind = SERVER, timestamp = 5, duration=1, service=receiver]\r\nannotations: [(1, cs, sender), (4, cr, sender), (5, sr, receiver), (6L, ss, receiver)]\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/318546734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/318547022","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499#issuecomment-318547022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1499","id":318547022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODU0NzAyMg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T03:23:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T03:23:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PS on messaging span, it is independent of this issue as we definitely can't assume all parts of the infra use span2 (we need conversion for the foreseeable future).
