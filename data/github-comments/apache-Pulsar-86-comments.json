This approach will NOT require users to 1) upload anything or 2) specify a classpath.

IMO supporting setting publish time on broker is a great feature to have and would be very useful for many other use cases which require monotonically increasing \"time\". so I think the PR should not be considered just for #3155, it has a broader set of use cases to support. We should discuss this feature independent of #3155.\r\n\r\nI think general consensus of delayed message was using functions to achieve that. but we didn't have a consensus of #3155 (IMO it is a \"delayed\" subscription feature).
