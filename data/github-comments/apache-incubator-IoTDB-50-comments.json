Add `ClusterGroupByFillNoVFilterDataSet` to handle GROUP BY FILL query in cluster mode. As the query with value filter is not supported yet, the implementation is left to furture developers. Please do not forget :)\r\n2. Refining the constructor of `GroupByWithValueFilterDataSet` and its subclasses, by separating `initGroupBy` to an individual method which is needed to call explicitly. As in `initGroupBy`, we should init underlying readers of timeseries. In cluster mode, we must use a new parameter `MetaGroupMember` to init `readerFactory`, which passed in the constructor. However, the `ClusterGroupByFillNoVFilterDataSet` extends `GroupByWithValueFilterDataSet` and the `super()` call must be the first line in the constructor, and we have no opportunity to set `MetaGroupMember` as a class field.\r\n3. Fix a null result issue which casing thrift execption thrown when calling peekNextNotNullValue().\r\n\r\n@JackieTien97 @CRZbulabula Thanks for reviewing the
