If the latter, I believe this issue is actually related to NiFi's handling of microseconds rather than the fact that it is using the target DB's column datatype (I have seen the same issue with JSON). If it worked before, I think it was \"lucky\" in the sense that the value was always treated like a string and in the SQL the driver accepts the string as a timestamp literal and preserves the microseconds. I'm not sure that if the value had been converted to a NiFi timestamp that the microseconds would be retained (and perhaps not the milliseconds either as you are seeing). I am still investigating.\r\n\r\nI'm not strongly opposed to having a property to configure this but we might be better served by fixing the code that truncates the fractional seconds, if that's what's going on here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1812950274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1813134116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8029#issuecomment-1813134116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8029","id":1813134116,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5sEjsk","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-15T19:30:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T19:30:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good +1.\r\n\r\nProbably worth in another effort going through task removing these from any nars that actually no longer package them.

Also removed the flow serialization and deserialization from those particular services. Performance was not an issue there as that code was not on a critical path, eg flow updates are expected maximum a few times a day, but most frequently we talk about weeks or months here. However having the serde in the services hurt SRP at some level, so moved the logic to an upper layer. Also now the flow serde logic is encapsulated in one class.\r\nRebased onto the latest main.

I feel like using explicit enumeration of attributes would not be needed if operators could be trained to design a simple regex.  We could do this in the PropertyDescriptor description, even giving an example regex that acts like an enumeration of attributes.\r\n\r\nHowever, regexes are hard for many people.  And I see you want to support Expression Language in the `Attributes to filter` filter .  I fully support doing this.  I can see use cases where using ExpLang to create a regex would not be ideal.  Possible, but not ideal.  So I would support an `Attribute Matching Strategy` PropertyDescriptor that lets you choose regex or enumeration to match attributes.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan, however, of a `Delimiter` PropertyDescriptor.  We aren't dealing with data that we can't control, the delimiter will only exist inside NiFi itself.  So, I feel like we can require a comma-separated enumeration here.  If operators have a pipe-separated enumeration already in an attribute, then ExpLang `replaceAll('|', ',')` can change the delimiter to a comma.\r\n\r\nI do like the `Filter Mode` to make the processor remove or retain the matching attributes.  I would rename `Attributes to filter` to something like `Matching Attributes` or just `Attributes`.  If you do this, `Attributes` becomes the subject and `Filter Mode` becomes the action to take on that subject.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1821747070/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1821772238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8049#issuecomment-1821772238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8049","id":1821772238,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5slgnO","user":{"login":"EndzeitBegins","id":16666115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY2MTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16666115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins","html_url":"https://github.com/EndzeitBegins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndzeitBegins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-21T22:02:48Z","updated_at":"2023-11-21T22:02:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

I think we can now update the logic in `canvat-utils.service.ts#isConfigurable` to not blindly allow the pg configuration screen to be opened. Not positive and correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect the original intent here was that we couldn't prevent the user from seeing the controller services of a process group if the user didn't have read access to the PG itself. Now that we plan to have a different dialog for this, we don't need to support a read-only mode for the pg configuration.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Previously users could have access to Services within the Process Group but not the Process Group itself. By pulling the service listing into its own page we no longer need to _always_ support configuring the Process Group. I'll update the `CanvasUtils` accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not currently allow the user to configure the current Process Group. I'll update this PR to guard against this case so there are no errors but actually supporting configuring the current Process Group will come in a follow-up effort. I've already begun creating the service listing and introducing a new route for configuring the current Process Group would conflict with those changes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1832650893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1833090976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8085#issuecomment-1833090976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8085","id":1833090976,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5tQr-g","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-30T04:30:29Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T04:30:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

taken a first shot at refactoring the `FilterAttribute` processor.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate if you'd take a look at the changes @mosermw / @exceptionfactory as you both are familiar with the topic.\r\n\r\nI've encountered that `allowableValues` actually supports passing in an enum class (that implements `DescribedValue`) and that's used by a multitude of existing processors. I thought that is a good match to align the declaration and usage, instead of passing `String` values around. Let me know what you think about that.\r\n\r\nAlso I noticed that we did a trim where that was not needed, as were trimming all values beforehand:\r\n```Java\r\n                .map(String::trim)\r\n                .filter(attributeName -> !attributeName.trim().isEmpty())`\r\n```\r\nIt seems there is no `not()` function available (at least for Java 1.8). I think the expression without the trim is now readable enough though: `!attributeName.isEmpty()`. Do you agree @exceptionfactory?
