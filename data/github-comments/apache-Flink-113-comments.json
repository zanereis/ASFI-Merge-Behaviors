check two things:\n1. docker assigns an internal IP to each running container (the one corresponding to the jobmanager is the one to put in the -m argument).\n2. The path you pass in the examples must be accesible from the container, e.g. you must copy the file in all the nodes (as I mention in the README), or mount them with a volume (-v on docker).\ne.g.\n\n```\n$FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run -m 172.18.0.2:6123 examples/batch/WordCount.jar --input file:///tmp/kinglear.txt\n```\n\nThe kinglear file must be in all the nodes. I copy those like this:\n\n```\nfor i in $(docker ps --filter name=flink --format={{.ID}}); do                                \n    docker cp ~/Desktop/flink-beam/kinglear.txt $i:/tmp/\ndone\n```\n\nI haven't seen that you can even execute that example without arguments:\n\n```\nbin/flink run -m 172.18.0.2:6123 examples/batch/WordCount.jar\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229923878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/229925578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2189#issuecomment-229925578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2189","id":229925578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTkyNTU3OA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T11:38:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T11:38:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please

@twalthr , I find that `expr` in `expressionDsl.scala`  has done what we want. As we can do like this: `12.expr % 'f0`  or `12 * 'f0.expr`.\n\nSo do we still need this PR ? Or just rename `expr` to `toExpr` ? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230375911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230421136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2183#issuecomment-230421136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2183","id":230421136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDQyMTEzNg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T08:46:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T08:46:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tillrohrmann i've added the wait-notify stuff.\n\nWe can't add a test since we can't reliable cause a callback to throw an exception.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230421136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230422030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2135#issuecomment-230422030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2135","id":230422030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDQyMjAzMA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T08:50:40Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T08:50:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That does look a bit bad as the default, agreed.\n\nThe current system does not support to include both the name and id in one field, correct?

good work @uce. The code is well structured and thoroughly tested. I had only some minor comments.\n\nWhile testing the code with the streaming state machine job I stumbled across a problem, though. Recovering from a Flink 1.0 savepoint does not work if the job contains a `keyBy` operation. The reason is that we had a faulty murmur hash implementation in Flink 1.0 and due to its correction, the mapping of keys to sub tasks has changed. Consequently, the restored state no longer matches the assigned key spaces for each operator. This is the problematic [commit](https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/641a0d436c9b7a34ff33ceb370cf29962cac4dee).\n\nThus, this change is actually breaking our backwards compatibility with respect to savepoints. In order to solve the problem I see three possibilities:\n- Revert the changes of this commit. But we don't know how the flawed murmur hash performs.\n- Develop a tool which can repartition savepoints\n- Don't support backwards compatibility between version 1.0 and 1.1\n\nI think that option 3 is not doable given our backwards compatibility promise. Furthermore, option 2 is not really straight forward, if the user has a keyed stream where he uses the `Checkpointed` interface. Given that the release is upcoming, I think option 1 would be the best way to solve the problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230501704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/230505465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2194#issuecomment-230505465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2194","id":230505465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDUwNTQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T15:04:49Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T15:04:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the thorough review!
