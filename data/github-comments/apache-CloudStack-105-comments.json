Everyone wants to help each other but we should avoid wasting time as much as we can, esr has documented this nicely here: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\n- Stackoverflow helps as well (see this for example, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13268796/umask-difference-between-0022-and-022)\n- Understand that adding non-issue comment adds frictions on PRs, while pragmatic reviews (especially those around design, security, real world usage, upgrades and bigger picture) helps a ton\n- The PR author may not be responsible or required to explain to each individual how each part of the system (while they normally would, but we should not expect that) especially loosely related technologies including dependencies work (for example for this PR, I'm not required to explain you how Linux file permissions or systemd works -- if you don't know that you may invest time in learning them on your own)\n- Avoid leading a PR and their author to change for a system-wide refactoring: while in general the codebase is inconsistent due to lack of coding guidelines and lack of historic enforcement, your specific taste of how variables are named, what utilities to use, how to write comments, how to place files and structure packages may differ from others and other such cosmetic preferences. All of such things if necessary to fix should have a separate PR/effort and not to be coupled with an given PR.\n- Other than checkstyle maven plugin we don't have any coding enforcement, if you've strong opinions and want to see change -- you may also consider taking a bigger effort to define a coding guideline and have contributors adopt that over time.\n- In the community, we value people over code -- therefore, avoid idealism and favour pragmatism else you risk adding unnecessary friction because we'll in general block PRs until an outstanding issue is resolved\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/212034630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/212040090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1420#issuecomment-212040090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1420","id":212040090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjA0MDA5MA==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T17:53:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T17:53:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhaisaab I think you are being too hard on @rafaelweingartner.

Since it, ultimately, the logger is a singleton, this reachability check is completely unnecessary.  In contrast, the garbage collector skips this check for `static final` members as it is guaranteed to be reachable for the lifetime of the JVM.  While the overhead of this check is relatively small, making logger (or any other constant values) instance members on classes whose instances  are rapidly allocated and deallocated accrues quickly.\n\n@syed Done properly, the appender approach can be made reusable for other test cases to verify logging behavior.  I built a [custom appender](https://gist.github.com/jburwell/98b6d94c57f409b5b778ffee6a8a12b1) that allows monitoring of a logger for one or more patterns and assert that logging occurred as expected.   The following is an example of how to use it in this test case:\n\n```\npublic class NfsSecondaryStorageResourceTest {\n\n    private TestAppender testAppender;\n\n   @Before\n   public void setup() {\n       testAppender = new TestAppenderBuilder().addExpectedPattern(Level.DEBUG, \"Failed to clean up staging area:\\*+\").build();\n       Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(NfsSecondaryStorageResource.class);\n       TestAppender.safeAddAppender(logger, testAppender);\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   public void testSwiftWriteMetadataFile() throws Exception {\n       // test operations and asserts\n       testAppender.assertMessagesLogged();\n   }\n```\n\nThe class likely needs a little work, and definitely, some testing.  I put it together quickly to demonstrate  a reusable approach to testing logging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/212596332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/212598453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1331#issuecomment-212598453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1331","id":212598453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjU5ODQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T20:43:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T20:56:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jburwell I agree with you.
