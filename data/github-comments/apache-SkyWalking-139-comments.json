I tried to add `/apm-checkstyle/checkStyple.xml` for `checkstyple plugin setting`, however i got exception as follows:\r\n> \r\n> `/apm-checkstyle/checkStyple.xml` is the right one, but the reported exception does no harm, just ignore it because the plugin cannot recognize `${checkstyle.header.file}`, it's for license header checks\r\n> \r\n> For this case, I think reformatting the file `MySQLLogQueryDAO.java` should work\r\n\r\n@kezhenxu94 I bet you are my sweetheart. ❤️
