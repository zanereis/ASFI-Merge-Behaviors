@tqchen for the explanation.\r\n\r\n@srkreddy1238 While removing the early return solves the issue to a certain level, I'm worried that tweaking the `opt_level`to 1 in some unit tests may skip testing some important passes, such as operator fusion.\r\n\r\nA quick fix for the problem of no functions for LLVM can be passing a graph attribute to the frontend indicating whether the `pre_graph` needs to be compiled and run, or just simply update the param names in the function `precompute_prune`.\r\n\r\nThe more correct way of fixing this should be adding special case handling in the compiler and runtime when no functions can be fed to LLVM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/433676858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/433677158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2004#issuecomment-433677158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2004","id":433677158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzY3NzE1OA==","user":{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-28T05:13:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-28T05:13:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah,

@jroesch for the changes, I did a serious round of review. \r\n\r\nBesides the changes I suggested, I would recommend us to deliberate about the API choices of the function evaluate.

Great points. I had similar thoughts.\r\n\r\nI think introducing tailcondtion as a schedule option of split/tile might be a generic-enough solution, so user or autotuner can select among them based on their needs for a specific arch.\r\n(b) and (c) should be two reasonable ones.\r\n(a) can still be the default, so we don't break existing ones.\r\n(b) should be a direct, simple extension on top of the current semantics (a), so some cases can gain performance benefit.\r\n(c) should be also a good one, but might take more time to introduce, since it involves more transformation. We can gradually add it.\r\n\r\nAll of these are still orthogonal to tvm's future high-level IR. So co-design can still have its own value.\r\n\r\n-L","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/434169276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/434169361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2031#issuecomment-434169361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2031","id":434169361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDE2OTM2MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-30T04:37:34Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T04:37:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@siju-samuel @junrushao1994  please review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/434169361/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/434186375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1970#issuecomment-434186375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1970","id":434186375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDE4NjM3NQ==","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-30T06:26:57Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T06:26:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@merrymercy I have looked into the error in http://ci.tvm.ai:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-1970/21/pipeline/232#step-255-log-1230.
