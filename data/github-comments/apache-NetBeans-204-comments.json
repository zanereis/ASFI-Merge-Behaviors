But adjust the procedure like this:\r\n\r\n- cleanup all directories relevant for testing (test distribution, user- and cache-dir)\r\n- ensure you have the nightly build available locally\r\n- switch off internet connection\r\n- unzip the nightly build\r\n- start the nightly build with a clean user and cache-dir\r\n- go to Tools -> Plugins -> Settings\r\n- Uncheck all Update Centers\r\n\r\nAfter this NetBeans will not fetch updates from the nightly build update center and you can test with the set of modules in the nightly build. You can reenable your internet connection at this point.\r\n\r\nNow you can activate the modules you need and do your testing. I'm sorry for this, but as you might have glanced from the confusion of @mbien and myself we were a bit surprised about this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2033090330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2033114203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7230#issuecomment-2033114203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7230","id":2033114203,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M55Ltxb","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-02T21:16:13Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T21:16:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for fixing this.

Nor is a dashboard displayer guaranteed to have that configuration.  It might be possible to consider, but it would take some thought to incorporate into the API, and I'm not convinced it's actually desirable.\r\n\r\n> What about making the dashboard itself customisable in future releases, so that the user can add/remove and rearrange items?\r\n\r\nYes!  The API is designed to allow this, and already provides the ability for platform applications to register their own widgets for display.  A UI for customization can hopefully come in the next release or so, but without a selection of other widgets to display, doesn't offer much at this stage besides moving around what's there.  This is covered in the description.  One step at a time! :smile:\r\n\r\n> an additional pane may be placed, for example, a set of links to demos and tutorials,\r\n\r\nThese were left out deliberately at this stage, because I think we need to look at providing useful and current demos and tutorials if we're going to put them front and centre. There is the possibility of linking these into `Learn & Discover` already - I don't think we need another widget for that.  That's where they are on the old welcome page.  We could consider a link to https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorial/main/kb/docs/ but that landing page should probably be rearranged.  The sample projects need to probably include something other than Ant for Java!\r\n\r\n> Eventually, the atom feed ...\r\n\r\nA feed widget is possible.  _But_, if the only point of the feed is to give notification of a new release (and that's all that's been there for a long time!) we already have another mechanism for that.  I started looking at making the `Check for Updates` link dynamic so that it eg. changes to `Updates Available`, `New IDE release available`, etc.  It would probably also change from hyperlink to button to grab attention.\r\n\r\n> each pane is delineated by borders ...\r\n\r\nYes, thanks.  I'd noticed on macOS, but hadn't checked with Motif.  The code removes the scrollpane border, but not the one some UIs set on the viewport.  Will look at fixing that and update this PR before moving out of draft.  The link colour is from `nb.html.link.foreground`, but not every look-and-feel customs is setting that.  I'm not sure about adding a hardcoded fallback in the displayer.  It works on the supported (and default) look and feels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2039827178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2039890259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7239#issuecomment-2039890259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7239","id":2039890259,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M55lkFT","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-05T14:02:06Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T14:03:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have hopefully fixed the issue with the viewport border, link colours and hover underline on a few non-default LAFs.
