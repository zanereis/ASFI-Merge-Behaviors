I only left it out because of my own ignorance, there.  I'll definitely add the input tests from your branch here.\n\nI saw the `reset()` method over in `PackageHandler`!

the place that got me started on this track was Grab command was the [Grape documentation](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html#Grape-UsingGrapeFromtheGroovyShell).  That led me to the same conclusion sounds like you came to: it's confusing for new users, and still quite a bit of keyboarding even when you know what you want.  It's just a bit ham-handed for my tastes, as well.\n\nThe approach I took was that I was looking for something that was playing the role of supplying things that would be understood by the [Grab Annotation](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html#Grape-Annotation).  That seemed like something that might be familiar, and didn't ask too-too much from the user.\n\nThus, my original tests for acceptance were 1) passing in things that the annotation could accept and 2) getting added packages to the `import` command's completion.  That's where the `GetIvyParts()` bit came in— the `Grab` Annotation class was looking for either the map... or the short form, but neither is really open to being called from the outside world, but `GrapeUtil.getIvyParts()` seemed to be.\n\nThe `GrapeUtil.getIvyParts()` call seems to chop either the `abbreviated` forms (e.g.: `'com.google.guava:guava:19.0'`, things that come back from [these kinds of searches](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava/19.0#gradle)), and value-type part calls (e.g.: `:grab com.google.guava guava` assumes the only two-part dependency that Grape would take, `group` and `module`; and `:grab com.google.guava guava 19.0` would take the only three-part.)\n\nI don't know if that's the _right_ way to go, but it's what I was going for.\n\n(I see the `:rescan` command gives a lot of power to the user in it's own right (it'll at least... make the runtime environment look consistent?)  And I'd _love_ to see the `rescan()` method called on all changes to the parent classloaders of the shell, but I'm not finding a way to passively listen for changes to a classloader tree.)\n\n(FWIW, I figured out how to pull and build the branch from Pull #104 — and spent a few hours trying to modify the `buildSpec` to take the Annotation short-form, but I ran into a problem: the `buildSpec` there presumes we can issue the arguments to `Grape.grab()` from a shell runtime environment.  So, we can modify it, but we can't then pass the shell's parent classloader, so `rescan()` wouldn't pick it up (without, of course, modifying Grape).  And I get the feeling that's what's been holding up #104 from being merged.)\n\nSo— sorry for the long post— and sorry it's been a few days since I could get back to this, but what do folks think of trying for this as a target contract?\n- `:grab` with one string argument\n  - attempts the Annotation short-form (Gradle form)\n- `:grab` with two string arguments\n  - that don't represent Groovy Maps\n    - attempts the two-argument version of the Grab install in fd567f7\n  - that do represent Groovy Maps (e.g.:\n    - `:grab [group: 'com.google.guava'] [module: 'guava']` or\n    - `:grab [[group: 'com.google.guava'] [module: 'guava']]`\n      - attempts the two-argument map version of the Grab install in fd567f7\n- same as above, but for the three-argument constructor with `version`\n- same as above, but for the four-argument constructor with `classifier`\n\nIf I hear a `yea` or two, I'll start work on the above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/195848077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/196180601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/286#issuecomment-196180601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/286","id":196180601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NjE4MDYwMQ==","user":{"login":"tkruse","id":1525116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1525116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse","html_url":"https://github.com/tkruse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkruse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-14T07:27:19Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T07:27:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, +#104 could not be merged because it had to modify Grape to work with a rescan.\n\n> :grab with one string argument\n> attempts the Annotation short-form (Gradle form)\n\nConsider the unit tests from #104, they test these arguments:\n\n```\n// one argument\nassert 'group:\\'\\', module:\\'foo\\', version:\\'\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec(['foo'])\nassert 'group:\\'\\', module:\\'foo\\', version:\\'\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec([':foo'])\nassert 'group:\\'\\', module:\\'foo\\', version:\\'\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec([':foo:'])\nassert 'group:\\'foo\\', module:\\'bar\\', version:\\'\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec(['foo:bar'])\nassert 'group:\\'foo\\', module:\\'bar\\', version:\\'baz\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec(['foo:bar:baz'])\n// two arguments\nassert 'group:\\'foo\\', module:\\'bar\\', version:\\'\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec(['foo', 'bar'])\n// three arguments\nassert 'group:\\'foo\\', module:\\'bar\\', version:\\'baz\\'' == grabCommand.buildSpec(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])\n```\n\nNot sure if that's what you were going for.

Also why I just added as a comment here.\n\nI think we agree on the spirit of the thing: the less a user has to type when they're extemporizing with the shell, the better the experience is going to be for everyone.

It is extremely easy to inadvertently create an integer object with the wrong value, because '013' means 'decimal 11', not 'decimal 13', to the Python language itself, which is not the meaning that most humans would assign to this literal. \n\nI am actually surprised they want to support 0O. It should also be noted, that they go with not supporting 010 anymore. I would have no problem supporting the 0o variant, but I don't like 0O at all. just using the leading 0 is also not that nice, so I am unhappy with the Java variant actually. Frankly I would have chosen a different letter like c instead. I mean it is x for hexadecimal, and only for binary it is b. I see no problem in using some letter different than o here... unless of course we want to align with python.\n\nA bit google usage found me that not many languages support octal literals, C doesn't have them. Scala removed them and Swift for example supports only the version with small o. My opinion is, the Python people actually made a mistake for allowing 0O, 0o is ok, but is it ok to have 0O10 and 0010 at the same time? Python's answer seems to be no. The VHDL variant would be O\"010\", but there you really have a clear understanding what is prefix and what is number. \n\nSo all in all I have no problem with allowing 0o for octals, I am against 0O as long as we have the version with the simple 0 prefix though\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/205716335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/206064371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/305#issuecomment-206064371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/305","id":206064371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjA2NDM3MQ==","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T01:23:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T01:23:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/206064371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/207782653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/307#issuecomment-207782653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/307","id":207782653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzc4MjY1Mw==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-09T12:24:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T12:24:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/207782653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/207782750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/306#issuecomment-207782750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/306","id":207782750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzc4Mjc1MA==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-09T12:25:44Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T12:25:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/207782750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,
