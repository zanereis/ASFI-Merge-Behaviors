they all seems like good ways to handle the situation.  In the examples you posted it seems to come down to\r\n\r\n 1. Do we only look at the status of direct dependencies or do we analyze transitive dependencies?\r\n 2. When a check is filtered out and its dependency failed, what should it status be?\r\n\r\nPersonally I would go with the option that is the most straightforward to implement an maintain.   Option 1 or 3 seem like they are the most straightforward to implement because they do not do transitive analysis.  Seems like option 3 chooses `SKIPPED_DEPENDENCY_FAILED` when its also filtered out.  I lean towards option 3.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2305481591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2306974029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4761#issuecomment-2306974029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4761","id":2306974029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6JgaFN","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-23T12:17:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T12:17:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

am trying to think of what the best solution here is. For the amount of metrics that we have, it seems like a table might get too big (have to scroll back up to check the column titles). \r\n\r\nAnother option would be to have just a \"list\" of the metrics each with its own header and have the info about each one under that. That way we could also break the metrics up into sections like `general server metrics` or `compactor metrics` like we do now with the comments. This might make things more readable.\r\n\r\nHere is what that might look like as an example:\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n# General Server Metrics\r\n\r\n## `metrics.server.idle`\r\n- **Type:** Gauge  \r\n- **Description:**  \r\n  Indicates if the server is idle (1 = idle, 0 = not idle).  \r\n- **Related Properties:**  \r\n  - `accumulo.server.idle.timeout`: Influences how long the server waits before becoming idle. Longer timeouts lead to longer periods of non-idleness.\r\n- **Conditions to Monitor:**  \r\n  - Extended periods of idleness during high usage might indicate issues.\r\n- **Recommended Actions:**  \r\n  - Review system logs for potential issues or unexpected activity.\r\n\r\n# Compactor Metrics\r\n\r\n## `metrics.compactor.majc.stuck`\r\n- **Type:** LongTaskTimer  \r\n- **Description:**  \r\n  Tracks the duration of major compaction tasks that get stuck.  \r\n- **Related Properties:**  \r\n  - `accumulo.compactor.max.running.tasks`: Influences how many compaction tasks can run concurrently. A higher value could increase the chance of compactions getting stuck under resource pressure.\r\n- **Conditions to Monitor:**  \r\n  - Long task durations without completion may indicate resource contention, particularly with disk I/O.\r\n- **Recommended Actions:**  \r\n  - Check disk usage and resource allocation. High load systems may require tuning.\r\n\r\n## `metrics.compactor.entries.read`\r\n- **Type:** FunctionCounter  \r\n- **Description:**  \r\n  Counts the number of entries read by all threads performing compactions.  \r\n- **Related Properties:**  \r\n  - `accumulo.compactor.threadpool.size`: Affects how quickly entries can be read. A larger thread pool can speed up the reading process but may consume more system resources.\r\n- **Conditions to Monitor:**  \r\n  - Low read count during periods of expected high compaction activity.\r\n- **Recommended Actions:**  \r\n  - Ensure that the compactor thread pool is properly sized for the workload.\r\n\r\n# Fate Metrics\r\n\r\n## Metric: `metrics.fate.ops`\r\n- **Type:** Gauge  \r\n- **Description:**  \r\n  Tracks the number of current Fate operations in any state.  \r\n- **Related Properties:**  \r\n  - `accumulo.fate.max.transactions`: Limits the number of concurrent Fate operations. Higher limits allow for more transactions but may also increase the risk of contention or failure under high load.\r\n- **Conditions to Monitor:**  \r\n  - High number of operations in progress could signal stuck or delayed transactions.\r\n- **Recommended Actions:**  \r\n  - Investigate if operations are stuck or taking too long to complete.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI am not sure the best way to structure the raw text for this list though. It may end up that having it in a table for development might work better and then that is rendered out to this list. Not too sure.\r\n\r\nI am interested in hearing others thoughts on the table vs. list argument though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2313386004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/2313496849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/4815#issuecomment-2313496849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4815","id":2313496849,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM6J5SkR","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-27T20:42:22Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T20:42:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DomGarguilo I like the sections with list example.

I can create one though. Two things I am thinking of that should be considered before consolidating these two descriptions though:\r\n1. Would we want to keep the description attached to the Micrometer instrument shorter than we would want the description that will appear in the markdown doc? This may be an argument for always keeping the description very breif (yet descriptive) but also adding more fields that further describe or explain the metric (as @dlmarion and @ctubbsii were discussing [above](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4850#discussion_r1736890762)).\r\n2.
