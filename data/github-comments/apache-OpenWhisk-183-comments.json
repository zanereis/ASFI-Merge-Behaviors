If possible, you may need to look into the container logs as well and see if there is any problem in the pod itself too.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like I'm having a hard time finding logs for containers, since containers are always created and destroyed. So I opened two console windows, one to call the function, and the other to observe the real-time container log. The result was very unfortunate, and the same result as the wsk activation command was printed. So, how should we access the container logs correctly and see what we want. I temporarily suspect that the container may not have enough memory. I have configured the container memory to be 8GB. Maybe I should give it more memory.\r\n```bash\r\nXXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX\r\nXXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX\r\n(base) root@work1:~# kubectl logs -n openwhisk wskowdev-invoker-00-5-prewarm-pythontorch\r\nXXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX\r\nXXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/assets/54056797/5eaa2b9a-9947-48ed-8110-b78af9ceb366)\r\n\r\nI will continue to follow up with some tests, thank you for your attention.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1632131259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1632148799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5429#issuecomment-1632148799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5429","id":1632148799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5hSJ0_","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T09:16:53Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T09:16:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Are you able to access the underlying node?

upgrade to 2.6.12 it leaks memory. Also, `OverflowStrategy.dropNew` has been deprecated in 2.6.11, and underneath the queue for the same behavior has been changed from `SourceQueueWithComplete` to `BoundedSourceQueueStage` which looks like without proper clean up of materialized resources doesn't free up the memory.\r\n\r\nIn our implementation, we use a wrapper on top of `PoolingRestClient` for HTTP communication between invokers and actions pods instead of OW `ApacheBlockingContainerClient`.\r\n\r\nI did a couple of different implementations, including:\r\n1. Use `OverflowStrategy.dropHead` to continue using  `SourceQueueWithComplete` instead of the new `BoundedSourceQueueStage` with extra logic on `shutdown` and no memory leaks were observed.\r\n2.

I think this should be considered to be defaulted to be on for the 2.0 major version though I'm sure that would be controversial as that will be extremely hard to apply to public clouds where there's no guarantee this change wouldn't break a user's function with lowered cpu. It would require a secondary deployment for 2.0 at that point where a function user consciously upgrades their function to the 2.0 cluster.

This kind of concurrency is actually only supported in the nodejs runtimes. Other runtimes just support '__OW_ALLOW_CONCURRENT=false' and can only handle one invoke/run per action container at a time.\r\n\r\nTo run the tests, the github action of the nodejs runtime clones the latest available apache/openwhisk repository and uses its master as the base to run its tests (https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml).\r\n\r\nThe actually failing testcase performs 128 (https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/c60a6676375d85878c658412162004848c19f965/tests/src/test/scala/runtime/actionContainers/NodeJsConcurrentTests.scala#L32) parallel action invokes/run requests into a single nodejs runtime action container. The scala test utilizes the AkkaContainerClient to open these 128 parallel connections (https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/c60a6676375d85878c658412162004848c19f965/tests/src/test/scala/runtime/actionContainers/NodeJsConcurrentTests.scala#L24).\r\nThe nodejs test action invoked inside the action container (https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/blob/c60a6676375d85878c658412162004848c19f965/tests/src/test/scala/runtime/actionContainers/NodeJsConcurrentTests.scala#L41) is coded to wait for 128 incoming invokes before it starts to complete all of them with a response (makes use of global variables). Means the first action run request to this action is held open and not answered before the 128th run reached the action code in this container. With this the test can be sure that this runtime can handle this number of concurrent action invokes being open at the same time. This test usually takes far less than 5 seconds in the github action while the timeout for this test is 30s.\r\n\r\nDebugging it locally showed that with the current implementation in this PR the test seems not to reach the required 128 parallel connections anymore. It seems after a set of open connections is reached (far less than 128), no others are done anymore or maybe they arrive very, very slow. With this, the pending invokes in the action container do not return a response in time and the testcase fails after 30s.\r\nReverting to the previous commit (0c27a650ab6073e131e5c74002465e93cf4d8621) resolves the issue and the concurrency test completes successful within the usual few seconds for nodejs:18 and nodejs:20.\r\n\r\nLooking at the changes in this PR it does not look like a change is needed to adapt the nodejs runtime tests. Anyhow, with your broader akka background, do we need to modify something in the nodejs runtime tests to consume this latest apache/openwhisk core?\r\nAny hints are welcome :-).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1778874198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/1779373945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5449#issuecomment-1779373945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5449","id":1779373945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc5qDxd5","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-25T14:11:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T14:11:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nSorry the slack invitation isn't woking for you.\r\n\r\nTo answer the question, OpenWhisk offers an \"at most once\" instead of an \"at least once\" execution model.
