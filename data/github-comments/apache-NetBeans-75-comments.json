I got an Exception when deleting some query text in the SQL Editor (attached).  I wasn't able to replicate it a second time. Stacktrace attached:\r\n[sql_completion_stacktrace.txt](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/files/5647566/sql_completion_stacktrace.txt)\r\n\r\n2. Changing the `Auto Popup Triggers` didn't seem to take effect for me unless Netbeans was restarted completely?\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing From another point of view, this PR allows you to *stop* that behavior of getting database metadata for Code Completion completely (by un-checking `Auto Popup Completion Window` in the new SQL Options), which you can't do at the moment?\r\n\r\nThe status quo appears to be that once you type a `.` character after a schema in a FROM clause, Netbeans queries the database for the Tables and Views in that schema.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you type a `.` after a table name / alias in the SELECT, Netbeans queries the database for column metadata.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if you are quick enough to not see the Code Completion dialog pop-up in NB currently, from monitoring the database session I could see those queries still happening.  Once this metadata has been retrieved, it appears to be cached and future references to the same table don't cause the queries to be executed again.\r\n\r\nThe additional burden of this PR is that Schema, Tables, Views, Synonyms will now also be queried for when starting to type a schema / table name in a FROM clause / SELECT.  Tested against one of our biggest Oracle clusters (~160 schema / 20k tables) over WAN / VPN, that initial query for schema/tables took on average ~1-5s and occasionally a worst case of 13-15s. Again, this appeared cached once retrieved and future queries didn't incur the same hit.  Against more modest local databases, no delay was noticeable.\r\n\r\nOf course Netbeans will also do that currently if one hits Ctrl-Space in the FROM clause of a query....\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/739328633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/739382331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2580#issuecomment-739382331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2580","id":739382331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTM4MjMzMQ==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-05T20:01:14Z","updated_at":"2020-12-05T20:01:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcdonnell-john I tracked the problem down into the OSGI runtime.

I still have a WTF feeling when I consider, that once again a build system was invented.\r\n\r\nI share your feelings. Looks to me every bigger project ends up inventing own build system (NetBeans included). I spent my first year in OracleLabs trying to remove `mx` (at least it now integrates with Maven central), but when it got to _either me or mx_ decision point I gave up and let `mx` be. Having `mx` creates some weird situations (like the need for this PR), but overall one can get used to it.\r\n\r\n> If I'm not mistaken, it has the same problems, that gradle exhibits, i.e. the configuration format is an executable file (at least I understand, that the suite.py is the configuration and the file ending indicates full blown python file). \r\n\r\nRight the `suite.py` configuration is written in Python syntax. However there is 1:1 mapping to JSON and that's what this module is using to parse the configuration files in a declarative way. E.g. we can avoid the Gradle situation. \r\n\r\n> This raises for me the question: Will the approach to statically parse that file scale to the future?\r\n\r\n* There are other systems in OracleLabs infrastructure that use the conversion to JSON and subsequent parsing. \r\n* There seems to be an overall consensus that this is desirable. \r\n* There are _gate checks_ that run the code used in this PR - should that ever get broken integration into any Graal repository gets rejected\r\n* Once this PR is accepted into NetBeans I modify the gates to use the NetBeans to do the actual parsing/verification - btw. it would be great if there was `--verifyprojectconsistency dir` option to run NetBeans in headless mode and verify project structure is still without any errors from a NetBeans IDE point of view, CCing @jlahoda! Recently also [requested on a mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r799decd155c9197bc2dbe6fc1185e090ce1dc7fafcdb91e55fc0b0e1%40%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E).\r\n\r\nOverall the conversion to JSON and parsing approach shall be safe forever.\r\n\r\n> In `CoreSuite.java` a big set of libraries seems to be generated. Are these dependencies set in stone? It looks like a strange approach to dependency management.\r\n\r\nThese libraries are mostly infrastructure JARs used by the actual `mx` Python code to perform unit testing, benchmarking, signature testing, code coverage tasks. These libraries may grow over time (just [recently a newer version of sigtest](https://github.com/graalvm/mx/commit/68fd66578b5b13f79fbf72a2c1e96164f5f43dc7) was added). But overall they are kept stable and immutable.\r\n\r\n> The one question in my mind: I read mx as a special system invented in the context of graal, does it pull enough weight to be implemented in the core of netbeans or could it live a s a plugin in the plugin portal?\r\n\r\nI'd like to get this PR in for 12.3 in its simple form, but long term I have to agree - it would be better to provide this module as a standard Apache NetBeans extension on plugin portal. We need:\r\n* build system changes to create a cluster(?) that is not part of final ZIP, but its NBMs are part of the release\r\n* make sure ergonomics module scans these NBMs for various registrations\r\n* polish the UX of downloading NBMs via ergonomics - for example when `mx.*/suite.py` folder is found\r\n* ultimately we can modify installer to install just `platform`, `ide`, `ergonomics` clusters by default and let the rest be downloaded on a fly!\r\n\r\nI always wanted [ergonomics to allow downloads](http://wiki.netbeans.org/FitnessForever), decrease the download size, promote features to install and I am thrilled to see this being considered again. However, assuming this PR doesn't negatively affects other modules when people don't use `mx`, I'd prefer to integrate it for 12.3 in its simple form and let the great visions materialize later. By integrating this PR as is, the module is immediately available in VSNetBeans - it would be great if this support could get into VSNetBeans as soon as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/739689602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/739929493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2365#issuecomment-739929493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2365","id":739929493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTkyOTQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"AlexFalappa","id":1875690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1875690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexFalappa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFalappa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-07T13:49:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T13:49:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Rahul-khandelwal

Just for curiosity, which class were you debugging when you found this error? (If you still remember)\r\n\r\nI knew that OSGI ties deep into the classloader infrastructure, but I thought it might be a problem in the code of (java) code of jgit. So I started from the stack trace element:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   [junit] Caused: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.WindowCache\r\n    [junit] \tat org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file.WindowCursor.<init>(WindowCursor.java:64)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked out the jgit source code and switched to the 5.7 tag. I set a break point in the constructor of the `WindowCursor` class, as that was the last place where things worked correctly. I single stepped through it, I stepped into the static intializer of `WindowCache` as the `NoClassDefFoundError` came from there.\r\n\r\nI then used \"Evaluate Expression\" to exercise the WindowCache loading manually and the exception reported was more helpful, as it explicitly pointed to the \"javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException\" not being found. That lead me to look at the OSGI metadata. There the import was missing.\r\n\r\nI then remembered, that I had seen, that for jsch the manifest was also added in the build system and used that as a template. The rest was fiddling with ant. Hope that is the info you were interested in. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/741963758/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/742293220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1069#issuecomment-742293220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1069","id":742293220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjI5MzIyMA==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T07:17:33Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T07:17:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, the PR can be integrated, if somebody polishes it.

Perhaps it would make sense to fetch more (e.g. table / view names metadata) at connection time, but what is unfortunate, is that the metadata doesn't currently appear shared between all components that need it.\r\n\r\ne.g. monitoring an Oracle session I can see that if I expand a Table node in the DB explorer, the DB gets queried for the Column metadata. If I then type `[tablename].` in the SQL editor, it gets queried again for Code Completion, rather than the Column metadata that has already been retrieved being re-used.  And vice-versa.\r\n\r\nThere's a list of SQL-99 keywords in `org.netbeans.modules.db.api.sql.SQLKeywords` which are used by the SQL Lexer for syntax colouring (and some other places in NB, like preventing JPA entities being created with reserved keyword names in JEE), but not SQL Code Completion.  `org.netbeans.modules.db.sql.editor.completion.SQLCompletionQuery` has hard-coded Keywords for the completion contexts it understands (basic CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, DROP, DELETE scenarios etc.), and gets the database metadata for schema/tables/columns...\r\n\r\nTo me, these are bigger issues, and this PR is a quick win-win (if @isarthur could take a look at those couple of bits I mentioned) as:\r\n\r\n1) It solves the JIRA ticket, making the existing (albeit limited) SQL Code Completion popup automatically, for those who want it\r\n2) Enables users to disable to disable SQL Code Completion querying the DB for metadata completely, for those concerned about it (e.g. @matthiasblaesing ).\r\n\r\nApologies all for butting in on this PR.

That is a worst case scenario, but I also observed slow meta data loading on loaded systems.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, completion while typing should be quick and this means, network round trips are out of the question.
