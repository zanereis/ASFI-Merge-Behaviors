Hi, I think there is a bit of difference between my problem with yours. My problem maybe encountered before the point of yours.

So the error message will not exist in heron_executor.stdout. Because the heron_executor command can't run and the `heron_executor.stdout` file is not exist in path.\nIn your case, your problem occurred after the pex installed. Can you find the `.pex` directory in the yarn working directory?\nI guess this problem maybe a system-dependent issue or config-dependent issue with python or pex. But I have no time to deal with the problem. \nSorry, I have no idea of the problem for now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/234154828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/234156364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1010#issuecomment-234156364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1010","id":234156364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDE1NjM2NA==","user":{"login":"mycFelix","id":4719414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTk0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4719414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix","html_url":"https://github.com/mycFelix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mycFelix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T04:52:22Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T04:52:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhangzhonglai - Hi, thank you for your reply and helpful detail informations.

I am looking at `AuroraLauncher`. It uses `Scheduler` as a library [ref](https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/schedulers/src/java/com/twitter/heron/scheduler/aurora/AuroraLauncher.java#L48). Which means scheduler is not needed by topology master or instances and hence there will be no issues if YARN scheduler keeps the TMaster in a different container.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/234413279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/234459466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1121#issuecomment-234459466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1121","id":234459466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDQ1OTQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T05:44:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T05:44:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@objmagic - are we adding a verbose option?
