Let's step back and change names / semantics if needed. Solr 10 is coming.\r\n\r\nIf by \"caller\" you mean the person/programmer/code that is leveraging solr to make a fabulous profit or save the world then there are two questions to answer: 1) can we trust these results as 100% definitive 2) what can be done to obtain definitive results if that's important. For number 1 we don't need to know why we just need to know if it's trustworthy, that's entirely binary as you suggest. However if we need to adjust things to supply definitive results (for that one case the customer really cares about, etc) then we need to know which nob to turn, and thus it matters which option is the limiting factor (one might set multiple limits or be using limits with this feature). \r\n\r\nIf by caller you mean the next (few) method(s) up the stack, then there is at least one important distinction between this and limits. In the limits case, we typically want to stop all work ASAP once the limit is hit. In this case the intent is that all shards should return up to the limiting number of hits. We wouldn't want to stop or terminate any other subrequests for this feature. Notably this feature would not protect the users from a shard living on a critically limping and slow server, whereas timeAllowed should ensure some sort of response even if one shard has nearly (but not quite) ground to a halt.

Lucene has a default Codec, which is a subclass of the Codec class. The Codec class has a method `Codec#getDefault()` which returns the static default. The initialization is delayed by a Holder pattern:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/30d18dfbe1e67bed2d4550b2bc20b9b86ce9781c/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs/Codec.java#L40-L59\r\n\r\nHere it is called:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/30d18dfbe1e67bed2d4550b2bc20b9b86ce9781c/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs/Codec.java#L139-L147\r\n\r\nBasically the trick is similar to your's but has more checks to really prevent codec subclasses to get the default during initialization phase (that's why the null checks are there).\r\n\r\n> I guess in cases where the instances are public and directly accessed or added to a list with `static { ... }` the holder pattern cannot be used?\r\n\r\nNo, that's the problem of most classes seen in this PR. It is impossible to use that where the superclass has a static final field to one of the subclasses. You need to break backwards compatibility.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2646355888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2646436311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/3111#issuecomment-2646436311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/3111","id":2646436311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6dvWnX","user":{"login":"malliaridis","id":33470669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDcwNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33470669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis","html_url":"https://github.com/malliaridis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-09T17:50:08Z","updated_at":"2025-02-09T17:50:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this as we have upgraded to 12.0.2 (see #3138)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2646436311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2646476270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2881#issuecomment-2646476270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2881","id":2646476270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6dvgXu","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-09T18:44:45Z","updated_at":"2025-02-09T18:44:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking back at this a bit briefly.
