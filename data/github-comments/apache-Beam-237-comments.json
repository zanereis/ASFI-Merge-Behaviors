- however, I'm still confused by \"Task 1\". Can you elaborate on what the file format you have in mind looks like, that is delimited both by newlines and by some non-newline delimiter? It seems like you could accomplish that by using a stock TextIO and applying a ParDo that splits every String on that delimiter.\r\n\r\nFor Task 2, I think we can also narrow the scope if we know more about the file format. E.g. if a delimiter is a marker line like `--- next record ---`, then we again can reuse the high-performant TextIO code for splitting bytes into lines, and then match whole lines against the delimiter.\r\n\r\nTask 3 should be implemented altogether differently, because in that case the files should also be marked non-splittable, to avoid wastefully producing byte ranges of the file while all but the one starting at 0 will be scanned in vain and produce empty results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316492183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/316498656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3579#issuecomment-316498656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3579","id":316498656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjQ5ODY1Ng==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T19:56:30Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T19:56:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Built

Here's another attempt. I applied your suggestion to throw CannotProvideCoderException. \r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to throw it further in places where we cannot handle the exception. However, there are places where doing so would imply the need of declaring the exception not only in Source class but in other abstract classes too (see the extend() method in Read.java, SparkUnboundedSource.java or UnboundedReadFromBoundedSource.java classes). I found it messy because it would spread the exception everywhere. Besides that, in StateSpecFunctions.java we cannot add the throws clause because the class is implementing external API which we cannot modify. \r\n\r\nIn those places I decided to rethrow the exception as RuntimeException as I've found no better way of dealing with it in such situations. It's far more better from passing null coder because it provides a meaningful exception message in case of no default coder.  Let me know if you agree with this solution.
