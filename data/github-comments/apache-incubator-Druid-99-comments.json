Using first/last aggregator at ingestion time is kind of tricky with the value we want to store. Ideally, we want to persist the first and last metric as long/double column so other aggregator such as sum can aggregate them. However, doing so would cause merging persisted data to be incorrect since no time value are stored for the metric. If the values are instead stored as time value pair, the column could not be aggregated by standard aggregators. Basically the problem is that we want an intermediate storage format for merging and a different final storage format for querying, and this cannot be done in the ingestion process. Now I‚Äôll just leave the comment in aggregations.md that first/last aggregators can't be used at ingestion time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/235463764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/235464553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3226#issuecomment-235464553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3226","id":235464553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTQ2NDU1Mw==","user":{"login":"acslk","id":11131839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11131839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk","html_url":"https://github.com/acslk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T02:33:21Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T02:33:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

this is a potentially severe problem for us, we're attempting to launch a beta in the next couple of weeks and were counting on this bug to be fixed in order to use Select queries to drive one of our key features. But I think we've got a work around. I'll describe it here and would welcome comments on feasibility and any performance impacts.\n\nWe have a page in our application that is populated via Select queries, routing through a middle tier service that handles the actual queries. We return a page of data and then have an \"infinite scroll\" type UI to fetch additional pages. this works by having the service return with each response the pagingIdentifier to be used to fetch the next page. So when the infinite scroll is triggered, it sends another request including the pagingIdentifier it received with the last response. The service can then use that to query for the next page.\n\n(By the way, this setup has another problem in addition to the current bug - if the matching data is sparse and a page spans many segments, the full map of pagingIdentifiers can reach into dozens of segments, enough to bust the limit on URL length when they are included as a query parameter. The following workaround addresses that issue too.)\n\nThe work around is to take the pagingIdentifiers returned by Druid and strip them down to only the last (latest) segment. That is returned to the web app, which includes it in the request for the next page just like the current implementation. But when the service receives that request, it parses out the starting time of the segment and uses that as the start date on the interval for the query. This seems to be working based on some cursory adhoc tests.\n\nE.g.:\n\nDruid returns `pagingIdentifiers`:\n\n``` javascript\n{\n'11_schema_2016-07-25T07:00:00.000Z_2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-25T21:39:13.302Z': 1899, \n'11_schema_2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-27T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-25T21:39:13.302Z': 201\n}\n```\n\nWe return, as the \"next page\" parameter, only the last of these entries (with the offset incremented per usual): \n\n``` javascript\n{\n'11_schema_2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-27T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-25T21:39:13.302Z': 202\n}\n```\n\nWhen that gets returned in the request for the next page, we parse out `2016-07-26T00:00:00.000` from the segment name and set that as the lower bound on our query interval :\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  \"queryType\": \"select\", \n  \"intervals\": [ \"2016-07-26T00:00:00.000/<...>\"],\n  \"pagingSpec\": { \"pagingIdentifiers\" : {\"11_schema_2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-27T00:00:00.000Z_2016-07-25T21:39:13.302Z\": 202 } , \"threshold\" : \"<...>\"}\n}\n```\n\nAs I say, this seems to solve the problem (but we haven't tested it thoroughly yet).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/235729318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/235747409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3264#issuecomment-235747409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3264","id":235747409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTc0NzQwOQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T22:59:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T22:59:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"note, #3270 will result in extensibility for StringComparator.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/235747409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/235750325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3278#issuecomment-235750325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3278","id":235750325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTc1MDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T23:16:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T23:16:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Perhaps it would be better for `VersionedIntervalTimeline.lookup` to return a snapshot using ImmutablePartitionHolders (like findEntry does).

thanks for posting your experience.\n\nFrom my perspective the problems you pointed out mostly come from the fan out to the processing pool on historicals. Most Druid queries work this way because it works well for aggregations that can be parallelized¬†and then merged. But Select doesn't really work well with the parallelize-then-merge strategy due to the threshold, the ordering restriction, and the lack of aggregation. It really begs for something more like \"continuous merge\".
