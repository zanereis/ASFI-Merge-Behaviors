Here are the issues I see with doing that.  First, I think we should be careful about putting additional load on the indexing topology.  For parser errors I think it's a wash, an error gets indexed with the original message instead of the parsed message.  But for enrichment errors, new error messages are generated and passed along.  If we send all errors and messages to the same indexing topology a burst of errors could affect the latency of other messages.\r\n\r\nHere is another scenario that could cause problems.  Imagine a message fails to index and an error is thrown in the indexing topology.  If we send all errors and messages to the same topology, that error could be replayed in the indexing topology over and over.  We could add some logic to keep that from happening but now writer bolts are more complex and specific to the indexing topology.  You will notice the error indexing topology is different in that it does not write back out to Kafka.\r\n\r\nI feel like by mixing error messages and legitimate messages we are asking for trouble.  Having them separate allows us to tune the topologies separately and avoid the problems I mention above. Tuning the indexing topology as it stands now is challenging enough.  I can understand not wanting to allocate additional worker slots though.  Maybe I am being too conservative.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/279466688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/279467666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/453#issuecomment-279467666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/453","id":279467666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTQ2NzY2Ng==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-13T17:50:13Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T17:50:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On the topic of invalid messages, they are now treated as error messages.

@JonZeolla , thanks for taking a look amidst the other demands on your time.\r\n\r\nI disagree with 'mv $fullpath/site.xml.bak $fullpath/site.xml' for the following reasons:\r\n* site.xml is now a fully auto-generated file (like the contents of site/markdown/), and is no longer tracked in git.  That was the METRON-717 improvement.  Thus, there is no reason to restore it.\r\n* There are many other artifacts of bin/generate-md.sh besides site.xml, that cannot be restored to former state, and that are likely to be just as broken as site.xml if the build is interrupted.  I don't want to give the impression that we've restored a valid overall context.\r\n* Leaving the entire state of the auto-generated content after an interrupted build, including site.xml, may give valuable information about the root cause of the break.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my not incorporating this change :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, for Jon and all reviewers, I should mention that after this patch I did a full re-validation of the site-book, both by:\r\n* visual inspection in a browser of every page of the resulting book, and by \r\n* recursive diff of both the generated MD source files and resulting HTML book files, before and after this whole PR patch.\r\n\r\nNo unexpected differences were found.

@JonZeolla , @ottobackwards , @cestella , @mmiklavc ,\r\nThanks to all of you for looking at this.  Taking issues in order:\r\n1. Absolutely right, no reason to have site.xml.bak any more!  Missed that, will fix momentarily.\r\n2. I'll have to look at that basename issue, but will fix and test on Centos.  Glad you noticed, and sorry about that.\r\n3. The weird behavior with site.xml and .gitignore is because the \"git rm site.xml\" command and the change to add \"site.xml\" to .gitignore, were squashed into a single commit.  If you do it as a sequence of two commits then it transpires cleanly.  But I was trying to respect the preference for squashing commits.  It won't manifest in fresh \"git clone\"s, but is a nuisance for folks pulling into an existing branch.\r\n\r\nSince I have to make another commit to fix #1 and #2, I will also split #3 back into separate commits.

I agree that it will remove complexity and make this PR easier to digest.\r\n\r\nAs of this JIRA all errors go to a single error index with source type and error type as JSON fields.  To answer your question:  the error indexing config.  I can see the advantage of being able to configure each source type/error type combination separately but I'm not sure it matters that much since we expect it to be very low volume.  I will think about that more this weekend.  From an implementation standpoint it's easy to modify so the design should be driven by the queries we expect.\r\n\r\nSame applies to invalid messages.
