merge，乱序也会影响聚合查询，本来可以读预计算的值，有乱序就需要读原始数据。\r\n\r\n第二个是我们一个默认参数设置的不太好，avg_series_point_number_threshold 设置的比较，之前默认是10000，序列少、序列比较长的时候，数据块就比较小，对查询不友好。现在改成了 30万。\r\n\r\n客户端注意一下写入模式，只要顺序写就没问题了。乱序可以有，但是太多会影响性能。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/653715782/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/653763423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/1453#issuecomment-653763423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/1453","id":653763423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Mzc2MzQyMw==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-04T13:01:33Z","updated_at":"2020-07-04T13:01:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,

我现在的需求是要提前获取列的类型，然后再插入数据的时候用preparedStatement指定类型，请问有这块的指导资料吗？\r\n\r\n看下这个文档的show  timeseries语法：\r\n\r\nhttps://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/Operation%20Manual/SQL%20Reference.html\r\n\r\n此外session有个API是fetchMetadata 应该也可以。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/654065948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/654066277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/issues/1461#issuecomment-654066277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/1461","id":654066277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDA2NjI3Nw==","user":{"login":"qiaojialin","id":7240743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDA3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7240743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin","html_url":"https://github.com/qiaojialin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-06T07:31:27Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T07:31:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"preparedStatement
