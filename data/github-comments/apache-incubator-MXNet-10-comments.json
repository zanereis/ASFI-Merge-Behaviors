for your contribution. For the gradient clipping, I think it should compute the L2 norm of all the gradients together right? In your code, you compute norm of each parameter gradient and clip them if its norm is greater than some constant, but the magnitute of different paramter will lead to different magnitute of gradient. In your lua code, you also compute the norm of all gradients together. Another thing is the `max_grad_norm`, could you also expose it as a parameter like what you did in your lua code?\n\nThank you,\nMinjie\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/153835406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/153837266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/483#issuecomment-153837266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/483","id":153837266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzgzNzI2Ng==","user":{"login":"jermainewang","id":4057701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4057701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang","html_url":"https://github.com/jermainewang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jermainewang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T19:24:28Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T19:24:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\n\nThanks

In the Julia side I exposed more information to an optimizer, including `batch_size`, so rescaling is automatically done for all optimizers (see [here](https://github.com/dmlc/MXNet.jl/blob/master/src/optimizer.jl#L214)). And an optimizer is model-agnostic so should work with any models besides FeedForward. I could back-port that to the Python side if necessary.\n\nFor output size, are you talking about single loss operation with multi-dimension output (like vector valued regression or image segmentation), or multiple loss operations (like those deep models where a softmax loss is connected also to lower layer hidden representations)? It seems to me that the situation here is much more complicated to handle _automatically_ for all general cases. Also, though the user might be tweaking the batch size a lot, changing the output dimension might not be a so common thing. I think it is good to have automatically scaling for specific losses like multi-output softmax-loss, or square loss for vector outputs, etc. But still leave the parameter grad_rescale to allow users to do customization.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/153890125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/153893365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/487#issuecomment-153893365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/487","id":153893365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mzg5MzM2NQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T22:43:54Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T22:44:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree.

My understanding is that those functions are there to help it easier to implement the wrapper `MXDataIter` (or maybe even array data iter). But there is no need to require all data iterators to implement those method because:\n- Those methods (e.g. `next_iter`, `getdata`, etc.) are never explicitly called, since all the usage of data iterator is `for batch in data_iter: ...` -- therefore, the only **required** interface is a python iterator interface, the user could implement it explicitly by writing the `__iter__` and `next` function, or by just wrapping a generator. But I might be wrong. If there is other potential usage of data iterator that requires a richer interface, please let me know. \n- I think it is not true that under different implementation paradigm it is equally easy to implement all the interface functions. For example, if I simply provide a generator to iterate over all the data. In order to implement `iter_next`, I will need to call the underlying generator, cache the results, and catch the end-iter exception, etc. Similarly, in order to implement `getdata` **on the iterator object**, I will need to explicitly fetch data from the underlying iterator, and store it somewhere.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/154069132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/154127143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/468#issuecomment-154127143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/468","id":154127143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDEyNzE0Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T17:18:27Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T17:18:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I get your point, yes I agree, **iter** and **next** are two things we need.
