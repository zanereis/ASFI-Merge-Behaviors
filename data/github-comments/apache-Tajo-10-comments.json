I also think that we should resolve this issue as soon as possible. \n\nAll changes look good to me, too. The only thing I concern is, as commented above, the frequent hangs during unit tests. Whenever a zookeeper client fails to establish a connection, the test waits for 10 ~ 50 seconds. I think that it will significantly bother us.\n\nI cannot find this error in the current master branch. Thus, I suspect that an existing, but hidden error is exposed due to the changed HBase-related configurations.

Here are the significant issues.\n1. Printing appropriate messages after creating an index. If the index is successfully created, cli should show a success message. Otherwise, it should show a failure message. \n2. Index metadata backup and restore. In order to support the index restore without recreation, we need to provide a new DDL statement, `CREATE INDEX [name] ON [path]`.\n3. Index support for partitioned tables.\n4. New index structure.\n5. Other experimental issues, such as prefetching indexes, for the performance improvement.\n\nIMHO, after resolving the issues 1 and 2, it would be sufficient to be merged into the master branch.\nWhat do you think about
