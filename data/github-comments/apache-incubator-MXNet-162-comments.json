There's no need to establish new namespace and I believe that current name will generate more visibility for this extension and appropriate.\r\n2) I write my code while embedding docs via standard Perl documentation markup, see http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html , that can be automatically converted to MAN, PDF, HTML or any other format conceived.\r\nThat said, the package is still alpha and I am currently concentrated in reaching full parity with Python interface, so the POD is not yet fully Perlish, there's a lot verbatim taken from Python doc.\r\nI plan to rewrite all of that after I am done with Python => Perl translation.\r\nAs well I am consciously writing this interface with look and feel of original Python interface, keeping all method names and parameters in sync, so Python docs and examples will be usable in Perl context as well. \r\n3) (and 4) I am volunteering to be the maintainer of the perl-package for the foreseeable future and will keep the module updated and in sync.

This is my current understanding of memory sharing:\r\n\r\n* python land: BucketingModule\r\n  * BucketingModule has a _curr_module member that is passed to module.bind\r\n  * initially this member is the default module, however each call to self.switch_bucket will set it to a different module\r\n* C++, GraphExecutor class\r\n  * GraphExecutor::Init gets a shared_exec that is the executor of the shared module pass to module.bind\r\n  * GraphExecutor::InitDataEntryMemory gets the data_pool_ member of the shared executor\r\n  * data_pool_ is a vector of ndarrays\r\n  * After GraphExecutor::InitDataEntryMemory is called data_pool_ will contain all ndarrays borrowed from the shared executor and also potentially new ndarrays it created. Important: As no all shapes fit necessarily it might have fewer entries than the original data_pool_ coming from the shared executor.\r\n\r\nSo with the above one potential problem occurs when we first see a small bucket and then a larger bucket subsequently. This is because in this scenario _curr_module in BucketingModule will point to the small bucket, which has a data_pool_ that is smaller than the data_pool_ of the default bucket module.\r\n\r\nGiven this I tried to modify BucketingModule to always pass the default module as shared module (as my assumption was that the default module will always occupy more space than any given module). Now this actually works, but only when turning off all memory optimizations (NNVM_EXEC_ENABLE_INPLACE=false NNVM_EXEC_MATCH_RANGE=0). If they these are not turned off we still allocate new memory in InitDataEntryMemory as the shapes across buckets don't match up anymore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280090454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280107155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4985#issuecomment-280107155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4985","id":280107155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDEwNzE1NQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T19:08:33Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T19:08:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please update submodule","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280107155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/280115117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5035#issuecomment-280115117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5035","id":280115117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDExNTExNw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T19:36:31Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T20:27:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the analysis.
