think there may be more than one issue here, so I'll add these for discussion\r\n\r\n- Giving some sort of indication that a later CLI version is available.  If the CLI is changing relatively frequently, then receiving explicit notification of non-critical updates can get annoying; so I would prefer not explicitly prompting the user whenever there's an updated CLI.  Maybe a check-for-update command or some \"later version is available\" denotation in the `wsk property get` or the proposed `wsk --version` is sufficient for non-critical updates.\r\n- Possibly have an CLI manifest with a high level description of what has changed since the previous version.  The user can decide if the update is worth getting.\r\n- Provide a way to easily manually update the CLI.   I'm wary of making this automatic, but let's discuss.\r\n- CLI/OpenWhisk compatibility check.  I expect that forthcoming OpenWhisk releases may not be backwards compatible with earlier CLI releases.  This incompatibility may vary from a total breakage to not being able to access/manage/configure a new OpenWhisk feature.  In the total breakage scenario, the CLI could block itself until the CLI is updated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/283420883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/283426083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1492#issuecomment-283426083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1492","id":283426083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzQyNjA4Mw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T18:27:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T18:30:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In response to @mdeuser's points:\r\n\r\n- We can have a property in the configuration file that enables/disables automatic checking for updates, and automatic updating of the CLI. \r\n\r\n- If there exist some sort of change log for Whisk, we can link to that.

After some further reading, I think the best solution might be to decode the subprocess output to text, if necessary, and always deal with text.  \r\n\r\n> Making the distinction easier to handle can be accomplished by encoding and decoding between binary data and text at the edge of your code. This means that when you receive text in binary data, you should immediately decode it. And if your code needs to send text as binary data then encode it as late as possible.
