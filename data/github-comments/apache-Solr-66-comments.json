Reminds me of something I said years ago. We are quite tightly bound to ZK for our coordination needs. This might be an opportunity to introduce an interface that is supplier agnostic (CollectionPropertiesManager) with an implementation as above.

Unfortunately, the randomization of doc values (`docValues=\"${solr.tests.numeric.dv}\"`) in a large number of the test schemas makes it such that we have to have `uninvertible=true` for a lot of them. Other schemas are actually testing the non-docValues functionality, so those have to be uninvertible too.\r\n\r\nUltimately out of the ~230 schemas that I upgraded to 1.7, only 40 of them required `uninvertible=true`, so a relatively small percentage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2256200031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2256204733","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2602#issuecomment-2256204733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2602","id":2256204733,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6GevO9","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-29T15:11:14Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T15:11:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Have you run the Prometheus export bats test?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2256204733/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2256229574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2571#issuecomment-2256229574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2571","id":2256229574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Ge1TG","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-29T15:22:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T15:22:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The previous PR to solve this https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/2086 has a test suggesting the alias matter only results in one request?\r\n\r\nAn aside: if we don't solve/improve the impact of alias resolution, then we shouldn't touch it in this PR.

The relevant directoryFactory config there is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <directoryFactory name=\"DirectoryFactory\"\r\n                    class=\"${solr.directoryFactory:solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory}\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs things stand on 'main'/'branch_9x' currently, the gradle randomization ensures that `solr.directoryFactory` is always set to be MockDF, so the \"default\" value in this snippet doesn't ever come into play.  But in the most recent iteration of this PR neither `randomization.gradle` nor `SolrTestCaseJ4.initCore()` set a default dirFactory, so the test will start using NRTCachingDirectoryFactory and fail as a result.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna try to go through and update the dirFactory default to MockDF in 'minimal' and some of these other lingering configsets, in the knowledge that these solrconfig.xml defaults were all being overridden by the randomization.gradle logic anyways.
