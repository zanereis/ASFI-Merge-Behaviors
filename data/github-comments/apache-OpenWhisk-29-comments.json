to #512.\n\nCurrently when a trigger matches a rule, the `caused` property of the rule activation will be the trigger's activation id. However, when the activator was re-architected, we lost the causality tracking between the rule and the action - so that the `caused` property in the action activation is empty (always). The activation of actions via rules will require some more inlining vs the current implementation - at which point the causality between the rule and the action can be restored.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/236376034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/236383261","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/962#issuecomment-236383261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/962","id":236383261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjM4MzI2MQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-30T18:57:32Z","updated_at":"2016-07-31T00:29:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mdeuser @dubeejw I rebased and resolved conflicts from the tests added in #927.
