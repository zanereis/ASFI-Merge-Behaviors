You need to modify the configuration file to claim which level of a path is the \"storage group\". It is 2 by default, which means if you write data into \"root.a.b.c.e\", then \"root.a\" is the storage group. Or, you can use `session.setStorageGroup()` to create a SG manually and then create timeseries automatically.\r\n\r\n2. If automatically creating time series is enabled, then the data type is inferred by the first data points of a time series. e.g., if the first data is an integer, then it is long; if the first data is a float, then it is double, otherwise, it is TEXT.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/587495426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/587495697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/822#issuecomment-587495697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/822","id":587495697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzQ5NTY5Nw==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-18T14:47:17Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T04:09:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We should pay attention to the compatibility.
