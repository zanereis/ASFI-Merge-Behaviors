Not only would Rust solve the data race problem, it would also improve integration with SGX via [rust-sgx-sdk](https://github.com/baidu/rust-sgx-sdk). I've also noticed that it's very easy to break the system allocator in very subtle ways by incorrectly memsetting the structs used by the runtime.\r\n\r\nI anticipate several challenges, though. A primary concern is C++/Rust interoperability (particularly w.r.t. dmlc-core). The officially-supported [`bindgen`](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/cpp.html) utility doesn't handle C++ very well so everything would have to go through the C API, which might be unergonomic.\r\n\r\n> How ThreadPool work with the graph runtime?\r\n\r\nTo answer your specific question, currently graph runtime doesn't directly interact with threads. The operators themselves call [`TVMBackendParallelLaunch`](https://github.com/myelin-ml/tvm/blob/master/src/runtime/thread_pool.cc#L330). This is problematic when there are multiple graph runtimes calling the same ops because launches simultaneously add work to the global work queue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/388138560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/388213360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1142#issuecomment-388213360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1142","id":388213360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODIxMzM2MA==","user":{"login":"yidawang","id":4458509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTg1MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4458509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang","html_url":"https://github.com/yidawang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yidawang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-10T23:15:22Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T23:15:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#1152 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/388213360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/388229516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1154#issuecomment-388229516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1154","id":388229516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODIyOTUxNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-11T01:06:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T01:06:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @eqy ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/388229516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/388230893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1153#issuecomment-388230893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1153","id":388230893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODIzMDg5Mw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-11T01:15:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T01:15:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let use  https://discuss.tvmlang.org/ to discuss this.
