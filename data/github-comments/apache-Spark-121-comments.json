for the suggestions.  I don't think this is a deployment issue though.  I don't have any spark/shark remnants installed from packages on the client machine.  (I don't even have an /opt/cloudera directory - my Cloudera packages seem to get installed under /usr/lib/hadoop, /usr/lib/hive, etc.).  Rather, I was manually deploying the binaries I built to /usr/lib/spark and /usr/lib/shark, and I've been completely removing those directory trees each time I do a new build.\n\nAnd similarly on the Hadoop cluster machines:  These are Amazon EC2 AMI's that I'm building, off of a fresh pristine Ubuntu 13.10 base, so there's no spark/shark remnants present before I start.\n\nSo I'm fairly certain this is an issue of me building incorrectly.  I think what I did to build was:\n- grab the current master branch of spark & shark\n- update SparkBuild.scala to downgrade the version from 1.0-SNAPSHOT to 0.9.1\n- update SharkBuild.scala to use jets3t 0.9.0\n- build both with sbt assembly and sbt package\n- when done, copy the versions of spark-core_2.10-0.9.1.jar, spark-bagel_2.10-0.9.1.jar, spark-mllib_2.10-0.9.1.jar, and spark-repl_2.10-0.9.1.jar that were generated during the spark build and use them to replace the corresponding jars in lib_managed in the shark build.  (My thinking here was that the shark build was pulling those jars from maven, and that perhaps the \"class incompatible\" issue was being caused by spark and shark using different versions of those jars.)\n\nBut result was the json4s issue I posted above.\n\nIn any case, as this is a build/deployment issue, probably best for me to take this off GitHub.  Would be very grateful, though, if you might be able to assist in getting a working spark/shark build for us.  Our company is a Cloudera support customer, so I'll try following up through those channels.  If you don't mind, I'll suggest that the support team get in touch with you about this, as you're obviously the most well-versed on the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42672273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42673811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/629#issuecomment-42673811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/629","id":42673811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjczODEx","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-09T14:44:45Z","updated_at":"2014-05-09T14:44:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Although there's now a 'fix' in, it is only going to do automatically what you are doing by hand.\nMy hunch is that perhaps the script, or env variable, already contains a classpath with \"0.9.0\" jars in it, which means that when they're replaced with differently-named jars, suddenly it can't find basic classes.

It depends on the ordering of the training examples. Users are not instructed to randomize the training data.

Could you try ordering the labels before training and see how it affects the performance?\n2. We use sparse vectors to take advantage of both storage and computation. If we apply the updater for every example, we lose the latter unless we do not put any regularization. Could you try training `rcv1.binary` and see how it affects the running time?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42691596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42692803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/710#issuecomment-42692803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/710","id":42692803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjkyODAz","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-09T17:37:10Z","updated_at":"2014-05-09T17:37:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, for yarn-cluster, we're not replacing the `app.jar`, so there should be no backward compatibility issues.
