We have no intention to improve solr server performance.\r\n1. We analysis database performance based on client(Exist Span),  read `MultiScopesSpanListener#L162). It will be confusing, both service metrics and database metrics dashboards showing with different names. Service dashboard shows agent config service_code, database dashboards show based on client(solrJ) peer.\r\n\r\nThe point is, I hope we could focus on APM, and don't get user confused.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/497754218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/497907240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/2801#issuecomment-497907240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2801","id":497907240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzkwNzI0MA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-01T03:08:13Z","updated_at":"2019-06-01T03:08:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Chinese comments are not recommended here.
