In my own opinion, @kkroy-zs 's work is going to open up a new and important area for skywalking.\r\nI have to say the data of the webpage is much more complicated than backend. The resource request, such as ajax request, is similar to backend service and could be easily handled by oap-server. But the page performance data, such as page loading time, is a very new world for skywallking. We should make some major changes to receive such data.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/425079072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/425110817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1710#issuecomment-425110817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1710","id":425110817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTExMDgxNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-27T14:20:07Z","updated_at":"2018-09-27T14:20:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Submit this PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/pull/1714 @hanahmily Could you try to run a test on this?
