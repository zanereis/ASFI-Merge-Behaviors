These are all different level of doc - the documentation of the product rather than \"Contributor's\" documentation. I just thought that if we make it .rst we could also make it part of the \"readthedocs\" docs generated. However it's not strictly necessary as these are two different types of docs. So I am OK with leaving the top level docs in .md format as well.

I got the old Kubernetes scripts working (slightly improved them) and I think it is pretty much ready for final review. It works for my account build: https://travis-ci.org/potiuk/airflow/builds/550362466 but the build for apache are super-slow so I wait for the result on apache.\r\n\r\nI will work with @gerardo as a follow-up on docker-compose-enabled version of Kubernetes tests next so the improvements will continue, but for now I think it's past the time we start using benefits  of the built-in image.\r\n\r\nThe last version has a few fixes to the kubernetes build approach:\r\n* I adapted the scripts to root user inside the CI image\r\n* I use --no-deps switch in kubernetes compose so that there are no two copies of postgres/mysql and other images while the tests are running\r\n* I figured out a way how we can make sure latest versions of dependencies (within requirements from setup.py) are always installed for the tests\r\n* pylint/mypy/docs/flake are all using the docker images - so it is super-easy to reproduce the CI static code checks \r\n@BasPH  - I also updated docs as part of my change. I am happy to merge it with your changes, or you can merge yours into mine - as you wish.\r\n\r\nPlease review! I look forward to merging it finally!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/505622327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/505642616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5453#issuecomment-505642616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5453","id":505642616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY0MjYxNg==","user":{"login":"astahlman","id":1173394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzMzOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1173394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman","html_url":"https://github.com/astahlman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astahlman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T22:13:08Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T22:13:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/505642616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/505656393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5453#issuecomment-505656393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5453","id":505656393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY1NjM5Mw==","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T23:14:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T23:14:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some more context around why we need this two metrics:\r\nWith `pool.starving_tasks.<pool_name>` we are measuring the number of tasks that are not able to get a pool slot when the pool is full. It gives us an idea about how many more slots we should add to the pool to accommodate all the tasks if the pool is over utilized. However, when the pool size is too large while there are very few tasks, `pool.starving_tasks.<pool_name>` won't give us much insight about how \"under-utilized\" a pool is and here is where `pool.open_slots.<pool_name>` and `pool.used_slots.<pool_name>` come in to play. \r\n\r\nThe reason we need both `pool.open_slots.<pool_name>` and `pool.used_slots.<pool_name>` is that it is easier to tell the utilization rate if we have both metrics on the same graph without the need to go to the Airflow UI to check the pool size.\r\n\r\nWe have very similar metrics on the executor side
