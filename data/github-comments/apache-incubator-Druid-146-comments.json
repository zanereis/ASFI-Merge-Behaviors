Thank you for proposing it.\r\n\r\n@drcrallen Your statement \"most people expect 4\" is debatable. I mean that in the best sense of \"debatable\". In the Druid community, you are probably right that most people expect 4. In the broader data community, people have gotten used to SQL semantics, and so they would expect 3.\r\n\r\nSuppose I am using a database I've not used before -- say MongoDB or Elasticsearch -- and I write their equivalent of `where attr <> 3`. I don't want to have to go to their manual to see how they handle null values. I want to be able to assume that their behavior is standard. Whatever their behavior, it's pretty easy to achieve the effect I want (e.g. `where attr <> 3 or attr is null`), but they're wasting my time if they violate the principle of least surprise.\r\n\r\n> Math expressions - the result value will be null if any of the components is null.\r\n\r\nCan you generalize \"Math expressions\" to \"All operators and functions unless stated otherwise\". Almost all the built-in functions and operators in SQL generate NULL if any of their arguments are NULL. (Notable exceptions are the `IS` operators like `IS NULL`, boolean operators `OR`, `AND` and `NOT, `COALESCE`.) But even `SUBSTRING` and `CHAR_LENGTH` adhere to this rule. (Remember, the empty string is not null.)\r\n\r\n> Comparisons between null and non-null values will follow three-valued logic and the result of a comparison involving NULL is not a boolean value – it is a null value.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the ability to store and retrieve null values is more important than 3-valued logic. And 3-valued logic will take a lot of time & effort to engineer. So, could you consider doing 3-valued logic in a second phase?\r\n\r\nIn phase 1 you could do all of the other features but still retain 2-valued logic (with `x = y` returning false if one of them is null).\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: we need 3-valued logic to be SQL compliant. But if Druid can simply store and retrieve null values, and has a consistent semantics, we (by which I mean us folks building a SQL adapter using Calcite and Hive) can work with that in the short to medium term.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/306571026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/306572853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4313#issuecomment-306572853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4313","id":306572853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjU3Mjg1Mw==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T18:17:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T18:17:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it will take us at least one week to roll this out at the best cases if i make it a number one goal so two weeks can be really tight, also would like to see so other hadoop users like yahoo folks @himanshug  and @cheddar roll this out and see if there is any issue.
