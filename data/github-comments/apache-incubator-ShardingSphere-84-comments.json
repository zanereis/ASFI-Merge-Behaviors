have tested by connnecting to MySQL directly, it work perfect\r\n2.Yes, my last response is the pure java main test demo,it purely use the DriverManager to get an connection from Connector/J.you can just copy it and run it from any ide you want\r\n3,yes,there is a bug in sharding-proxy, the bug is not related with any connection pool,it is related to the version checking of mysql server version. \r\n4.Ｉ think i haved descript the root case is very clear.but let me describe it again in Chinese:|\r\n\r\n原因就是mysql-connector-j里的com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement的变量serverSupportsFracSecs在方法\r\n`protected void detectFractionalSecondsSupport() throws SQLException {\r\n        this.serverSupportsFracSecs = this.connection != null && this.connection.versionMeetsMinimum(5, 6, 4);\r\n    }`\r\n里设置的值为false。直接连数据库设置的值为true。之所以链接sharding-proxy的值为false，是因为this.connection.versionMeetsMinimum(5, 6, 4);这个条件比较满足不了。应该是sharding-proxy没返回版本号？\r\n如果要进一步追踪，就是在MysqlIO.java里的doHandshake(String user, String password, String database)方法，第1043行 this.serverVersion = buf.readString(\"ASCII\", getExceptionInterceptor());\r\n读取到的值为 '5.6.0-Sharding-Proxy 4.0.0-RC2'。我想是sharding-proxy里hard code了版本号？？？。这里导致读取到的版本号为5.6.0，然而我真实的mysql数据库版本号应该是5.7.25.\r\nsharding-proxy返回5.6.0的版本号满足不了mysql jdbc driver的5.6.4版本号的最低要求检查，导致时间戳毫秒数丢失。我想这里描述应该非常的清楚了吧？能否安排解决一下？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560205038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560213428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3628#issuecomment-560213428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3628","id":560213428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDIxMzQyOA==","user":{"login":"HongJinFeng","id":33616750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE2NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33616750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng","html_url":"https://github.com/HongJinFeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HongJinFeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T03:31:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T03:31:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Found

Thanks for your patience.\r\n> \r\n> I prefer to update the version from 5.6.0-Sharding-Proxy to 5.6.4-Sharding-Proxy.\r\n\r\nI am wondering why you like to hardcode the version number... cause when I debug in the mysql driver, I found that there are a lot of different version checkings for different mysql functions.I am not sure if the 5.6.4 is the highest version number in all the driver source code, for timestamp format itself,it is 5.6.4,but for others, some lower, some maybe higher, I think the most safty way is to check the version agains the mysql server in the proxy startup and combine with your proxy version then set to your constant parameter?\r\nmaybe you have your own concern, this is just my opinion...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560259088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560259939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3634#issuecomment-560259939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3634","id":560259939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDI1OTkzOQ==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T06:58:12Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T06:58:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If

The   reason  as  follow:\r\nWhen `LeafSnowflakeKeyGenerator`  is being initialized , its  method  `initializeTimeNodeIfNeed()`  invokes  one time  `FixedTimeService.getCurrentMillis()` , `invokeTimes`  value  is  `0`   .  This  first  call  of  `FixedTimeService.getCurrentMillis()`  is  just  for  initialization .  Then  when \r\n `LeafSnowflakeKeyGenerator`   finishs  its initialization  and  begins  to   generate  the  first  key  , the  `invokeTimes`  of  `FixedTimeService.getCurrentMillis()`   value  change  to  `1`.  That  means   when  we   generate  the  first  key ,  the  actual  call  of  `FixedTimeService.getCurrentMillis()`   we make  is  not   the  first  call.\r\nSo , this  test   case   just   invokes  `5`   times , but  I set  it  to `6` .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560308727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560309312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3633#issuecomment-560309312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3633","id":560309312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDMwOTMxMg==","user":{"login":"haetao","id":46469719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDY5NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46469719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao","html_url":"https://github.com/haetao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haetao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T09:25:53Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T09:25:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any
