have just 2 ideas for consideration, none of them is blocking:\n- What do you think about changing the directory name from `runners/flink-runner` to `runners/flink`? Sounds simpler, and perhaps less unnecessary duplication. I'm sorry if I'm now giving a different recommendation than what the document initially said.\n- When we did the Dataflow code drop, we preserved all commit history of the old repository under the pretense that it may help other better understand why certain things were done. Perhaps you can consider doing the same. An extra benefit is that it gives an appropriate credit to all authors of this codebase and makes the graphs more accurate.\n\nLet me know what you think. Either way, I think it is great.
