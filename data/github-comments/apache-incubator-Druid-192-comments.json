Following this issue, we started tracking slow queries on the MySQL DB, and I'm seeing queries like the following repeat often -\r\n`SELECT payload FROM druid_segments WHERE used = true AND dataSource = 'player-events-historical' AND ((start <= '2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z' AND `end` >= '2018-07-11T03:00:00.000Z'));`\r\n  a. Is it possible to delete rows with used = false from this table? While I saw there is already an index for `used`, keeping the table small can probably help. In our case, only ~1% of the rows there have used=true, I'm guessing it's because KIS tasks create partitioned segments that we later merge.\r\n  b. I'm thinking about replacing the existing (used) index with an index of (used, end), since it seems these queries always have end >= (some recent timestamp), does that make sense?\r\n2. Going over the tables one by one, I saw that druid_tasks & druid_tasklogs also have rows being accumulated, does it make sense to clean those? from what I saw, there is no date on druid_tasklogs, but I can get a list of old tasks from druid_tasks, and then delete both the tasks and their logs by id.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nEran","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/404050959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/404134850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4139#issuecomment-404134850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4139","id":404134850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDEzNDg1MA==","user":{"login":"asdf2014","id":8108788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014","html_url":"https://github.com/asdf2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asdf2014/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T11:20:52Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T11:20:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@drcrallen @jihoonson Travis is good enough.

We can close this issue when those are figured out.\r\n\r\nFiles with a non-standard header (by Druid standards):\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/extendedset/src/main/java/io/druid/extendedset/intset/AbstractIntSet.java\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/extendedset/src/main/java/io/druid/extendedset/intset/ConciseSet.java\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/extendedset/src/main/java/io/druid/extendedset/intset/IntSet.java\r\n\r\nThe license on the these three files seems ok (it's Apache 2.0) and also we already call this copying out in the NOTICE file. So they seem ok to me but I'm just calling them out to double-check.\r\n\r\nWe also have two files with no license header:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/extendedset/src/main/java/io/druid/extendedset/intset/ConciseSetUtils.java\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/extendedset/src/main/java/io/druid/extendedset/utilities/IntList.java\r\n\r\nIn that issue, @fjy said:\r\n\r\n> ConciseSetUtils is from the original ConciseSet library under the Apache license. The license header is missing for the file but it should be the same as the rest of the files under the ConciseSet library (Apache v2).\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n> IntList is from the same place\r\n\r\nI can't find the original source of the Concise library. The paper is at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.0403.pdf, which links to source at http://concise.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/concise?view=rev&revision=1; however, that link is dead. However, I did some digging and found this commit: https://github.com/metamx/extendedset/commit/02366f18385b3e082866e5bbbd38357ceee13d79#diff-97bd266eb5d2e8b0e7a38a658921356d. So it looks like these files with no headers were created in a refactor with code largely taken from ConciseSet (which is Apache licensed). So, that's good.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to move forward here? Could we leave the first three files as-is, and add identical, nonstandard headers to the other two files describing where they came from and that they are Apache licensed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/404257393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/404265196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5980#issuecomment-404265196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5980","id":404265196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDI2NTE5Ng==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T18:22:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T18:22:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The last commit is not related to this PR.

That SQL is to list all _used_ (live) segments falling in an interval, and it can be called 1) whenever a new segment is allocated in KIS and 2) when a taskLock is acquired in batch ingestion (like index or merge tasks). \r\na. Yes, you can delete them, but I would recommend to use the kill task rather than manually deleting rows. You can set `druid.coordinator.kill.on` to true for coordinators to periodically kill segments. Please check http://druid.io/docs/0.10.0/configuration/coordinator.html#coordinator-operation for details.\r\nb. I haven't tested, but sounds making sense. \r\n2. The `druid_tasklogs` is not actually being used, so you can freely delete all entries in that table. Please check https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/5859. For `druid_tasks`, yes you can delete old entries from that table. One thing I'm curious is, do you have an actual issue of too large `druid_tasks` table? or are you just checking all tables? If you have an actual issue, it may make sense to support auto cleanup for `druid_tasks` table too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/404276658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/404285477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5979#issuecomment-404285477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5979","id":404285477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDI4NTQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"erankor","id":4777488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Nzc0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4777488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor","html_url":"https://github.com/erankor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erankor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T19:35:04Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T19:35:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @jihoonson, regarding 2, as you wrote - I just went over all tables, and looked deeper into the ones with a non-negligible number of rows - I don't have any issue with this table.
