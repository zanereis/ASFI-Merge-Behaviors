It's unfortunate Fuseki needs its own copy at the moment.\r\n\r\nMy long term plan is to consolidate on Fuseki Main and not have a webapp except keeping the WAR file around. i.e. change the standalone JAR. Fuseki modules will add the admin and UI functionality - this has been prototyped but still some way from being ready.\r\n\r\nWe don't get any benefit from being a webapp - the war file has always seemed to be little used compared to the standalone jar. \r\n\r\nWhat with containers and cloud, FusekiMain with a choice of [modules](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/fuseki-modules.html) makes more sense - c.f. Apache Httpd.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1240410366/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1240419055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1521#issuecomment-1240419055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1521","id":1240419055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5J70rv","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T08:48:34Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T08:48:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Indeed it can be. \r\n\r\nDid it make any difference to performance in some situation?.

If I add a Thread.sleep(1000) call before leaving the try-with-resources block then the test also fails on Linux. The justification why the test fails at 60K bytes is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Chunk size is set to 100, one triple in the test is always exactly 50 bytes - so one chunk corresponds to 5000bytes.\r\n- The queue size is 10 - so it can hold triples worth 50K bytes, after that it blocks.\r\n- However, we consume 10 triples which removes one chunk, which gets filled up again - at this point we consumed 55K.\r\n- Then we abort, which clears the queue and schedules abort on the next chunk. When it arrives 60K have been consumed (this assumes that the parser thread is blocked while it invokes the destination).\r\n\r\nSo the read ahead in the test is  `(queueSize + 2) * (chunkSize * tripleByteSize)`. If the parser used buffering then a bit more could be read.\r\n\r\nBut e.g. setting the limit in the test to e.g. 70.000 should fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n> And it's not the only unstable test.

I had to tweak it a little more to get everything working. Then spent some time working on warnings and minor issues with the YASG/YASQE and the file upload components.\r\n\r\nAll manual tests passed. Linter passed with no errors. Updated dependencies once again with `ncu -u` and `yarn install`. The unit tests passed after adjusting the testing libraries (that was updated too, along with Vue 3). Finally, fixing the e2e tests was easy, but good because these tests detected an important bug that would have passed by my tests.\r\n\r\nIt was when you had pagination in the table, like when you have more than 5 datasets. Pagination wasn't working due to a mistake on how to use v-model with Vue 3.\r\n\r\n@afs when you have some spare time to review this one, I think it would be interesting for the review:\r\n\r\n- see if you spot anything that looks odd in the code;\r\n- confirm it works some different way than what I used (I used Eclipse + WebStorm, running FusekiCMD on the latter, and `yarn run server` on the former/terminal);\r\n- confirm there is nothing in the UI that looks odd (I cannot tell anymore, after looking at the UI for so long, but I will take another look in a few weeks);\r\n- test some crazy things, like a query that's more complex than the simple one I used, or edit a graph (I tested it, but who knows), or if you see a table with pagination, then force it to have at least more than 1 page, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce this is merged our dependencies should be using the latest available for Vue and related dependencies. When I started this rewrite my goal was a) replace Backbone by something else like Vue ✅, b) add dependency management ✅, c) add tests both unit and integration/e2e ✅, and then d) upgrade to Vue 3 ⏹️.\r\n\r\nOther plans include improving the UI for accessibility (translation, color schemas, dark/light modes, vision-impaired users, etc), UIUX improvements, and allow for extensibility (like having plug-ins, or re-using parts of the UI in other applications).

This may well be because the toolchain is not up to date (how/what can I check?) but they are timeouts so could that be the issue?\r\n\r\nCould be. Cypress is not a small executable, nor just a few JS files. Last I checked it brought several MB to run it, and is memory hungry too. @afs if you prefer I can remove it from the Maven build, and we can run it manually in our local workstations and on Jenkins or GH Actions.\r\n\r\n> Then, I pushed the PR branch to my Jena working copy and ran the github action for Linux:\r\n> \r\n> The UI step worked (the build failed for other reasons - it does sometimes) https://github.com/afs/jena/actions/runs/3095974510/jobs/5010983697\r\n\r\n:+1: It works for me locally too, but it could be because I have everything installed globally (Cypress/Yarn/etc) as I use it for other projects too, or because I used it manually to run the e2e tests so it may have downloaded something else.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nkinow@ranma:~/Development/java/jena/jena$ mvn clean test install -Pdev\r\n# ...\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Jena 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Jena ........................................
