I think one of the important things to mention in this document is database access during parsing time and especially avoiding to use Airflow Variables in the DAGs (they are still ok to use in \"execute\" method). \r\n\r\nThis is a known problem that people are complaining a lot that scheduler opens and closes a lot of connections to the database - because every time the file is parsed, and variable is reached, a database connection is opened and query executed.\r\n\r\nI think there are lots of examples around with using variables in the DAGs but this is not really a good practice and I think this is a perfect place to mention it. \r\n\r\nI believe environment variables are better way to share common configuration. \r\n\r\n@kaxil @ashb @mik-laj  - what are your thoughts about it

I saw your comment - while writing this. Cool that you are working on it :). \r\nThe process we have now is that we want to make sure 1.10.* does not diverge from master so we implement all the changes as PRs to master and cherry-pick them (committers do it usually) if we decide to back-port them to v1-10-test and then when tests pass we move then to v1-10-stable branch.  However we must make sure that those changes are backwards compatible in 1.10 (unless we have very good reason to drop compatibility).\r\n\r\nSo if those changes are based on some existing commit in master it's better to pin-point this and cherry pick from there. If those are new changes, they should be added as PR to master and cherry-picked after it gets merged in master. \r\n\r\nI think it's not described very well, but we are just in a process of updating contributor's documentation with Google Season of Docs and I think it's a good point to add to CONTRIBUTING.rst (@efedotova -> maybe we can add it to the workflows we were discussing about)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/551707439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/551712040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6269#issuecomment-551712040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6269","id":551712040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTcxMjA0MA==","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T12:31:08Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T12:31:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
