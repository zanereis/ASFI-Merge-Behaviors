We can start with some jakarta ee9 smoke tests first and later run against with Jakarta jaxws standalone TCK. \r\n\r\n> Do you think those are valid concerns? What are your thoughts? Thank you!\r\n\r\nThanks for you valuable review and input for this topic. Another thing I am not sure is : to transform cxf artifacts, should we have some subset of cxf artifacts to transform first instead of transforming all the things ? Should we draft some work plan to get this done step by step ? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/938404858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/938841408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/855#issuecomment-938841408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/855","id":938841408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR8439ZVA","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-08T16:50:36Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T16:50:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jimma thank you, regarding your questions:\r\n > Another thing I am not sure is : to transform cxf artifacts, should we have some subset of cxf artifacts to transform first instead of transforming all the things ?\r\n\r\nDefinitely, I believe Romain also suggested that on the mailing list, we could try JAX-RS first fe, and I could take care of TCK part, since we did it for Java EE, it should be pretty straightforward for Jakarta EE (same repo but another branch).\r\n\r\n> I actually didn't think of OSGI manifest.

\r\n> \r\n> I'm thinking that it is incorrect to close the `Response` after reading it (see my comments in the test case). I'm wondering if we could pass the cast-type to a new `ResponseImpl` that should only be used on the client - the caller would need to specify what the response entity is intended to be cast to by proxy-based clients (JAX-RS clients would continue using the existing constructors). Then if the proxy-based client returns a `Response`, we leave the behavior the same as JAX-RS, but otherwise we would close after reading. Wdyt?\r\n\r\nThanks @andymc12 , I would certainly prefer to keep it unchanged (and not close the response after reading), having a hard time to fit CXF into the TCK / spec space without changing that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have consulted Jersey as the reference implementation and the  the `Response` entity is indeed closed after reading, so I think we are changing the right parts (see please https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/blob/master/core-common/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/message/internal/InboundMessageContext.java#L896). \r\n\r\nWould be great to understand what I am missing here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/957452885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/957462463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/866#issuecomment-957462463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/866","id":957462463,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR845Ebe_","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T12:34:25Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T12:34:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just realized, we should probably introduce the distinction between \"closing the response\" and \"closing underlying entity\", I think these two are tangled right now in `ResponseImpl` under `close()`: the only thing \"closing the response\" does is \"closing underlying entity\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/957462463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/957687969","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/866#issuecomment-957687969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/866","id":957687969,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR845FSih","user":{"login":"andymc12","id":21365299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzY1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21365299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12","html_url":"https://github.com/andymc12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymc12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-02T14:23:35Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T14:23:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reta I see your point, and I agree that this change gets us closer to Jersey's behavior.  I think I don't like the overall architecture (JAX-RS spec, not CXF) as it basically says things are different on the client vs server.  For example:\r\n```\r\nResponse r1 = Response.ok(\"foo\").build();\r\nassert \"foo\".equals(r1.readEntity(String.class));\r\nassert \"foo\".equals(r1.getEntity()); // since foo is not backed by an input stream, it must be cached\r\n// it's sort of like a safeguard in case you lost a reference to the entity but still have a reference to the Response\r\n\r\n// but on the client side...\r\nResponse r2 = someTarget.request().get();\r\nassert \"foo\".equals(r2.readEntity(String.class);\r\nassert exceptionThrown(IllegalStateException.class, () -> r2.getEntity());\r\n\r\n// further... (unless I'm misreading the Jersey code)\r\nResponse r3 = someTarget.request().get();\r\nassert r3.bufferEntity();\r\nassert \"foo\".equals(r3.readEntity(String.class);\r\nassert r3.getEntity() instanceof InputStream; // what?! not String??\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases the `Response` object is a permanent holder of the entity, but in others it is not. And \"permanent\" might change depending on methods called on the `Response` object - other than `close`.  It might also depend on methods called on the stream... for example:\r\n```\r\nResponse r4 = someTarget.request().get();\r\nInputStream is = r4.readEntity(InputStream.class);\r\nassert r4.getEntity() != null && r4.getEntity() instanceof InputStream; // can even call it twice because the stream is not consumed\r\nfullyConsume(is);\r\nassert exceptionThrown(IllegalStateException.class, () -> r4.getEntity());\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like this inconsistency.  I think that `Response` should either be a permanent (until closed) holder of entities or it should not be a holder at all (i.e. once `readEntity` is called, the response no longer has an entity - the caller must keep a reference to it - but the response doesn't have to be closed - callers could still check things like status code or headers).  But I think the current described behavior is confusing - for users and implementors.  \r\n\r\nI'll plan to take this up with the JAX-RS community, but for now, I think this change works.  Thanks (and sorry for the rant! :) ).
