Especially Daniel Schonfeld who proposed the final solution.  The new CPU utilization should be just slightly higher then it was without batching.</p>\n\n<p>On a happy side note this reduced the CPU utilization everywhere with batching so now with all of the performance changes that have gone in I can run a 2 worker ThroughputVsLatency topology at 43,000 sentences per second on my MBP, with a max spout pending of 100 and Automatic Back Pressure off.  I don't have an apples to apples comparison with before this change.  Because it looks like ABP was limiting things to about 35,000 sentences per second.  Either way we are running a lot better then we were before where we would max out at about 6,500 sentences per second.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612629394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/156498367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/838#issuecomment-156498367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/838","id":156498367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjQ5ODM2Nw==","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-13T17:43:50Z","updated_at":"2015-11-13T17:43:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm +1 for adding this functionality, but I would say that vote is non-binding since this is new code/functionality I'm not that familiar with yet.

So in default case, each worker directory will only have very limited number of log files and gc files(10). We met the above problem in a very extreme case where we set the gc log file name with pid, causing the automatic file number limit not working and crazy restarting creates a huge number of gc files
