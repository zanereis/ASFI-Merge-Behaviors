Can you explain the difference between this protocol and the original base class?\r\n> \r\n> The main problem is that in a number of places in the code (for example here: [3784ba4#diff-f95b3d6216459574a0b3954a85a98db1L251](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/3784ba4ce5a4618d7e090adfd4130e1d64fc812d#diff-f95b3d6216459574a0b3954a85a98db1L251) ) other entities (for example base_job) used internal implementation of BaseExecutor (it assumed that some internal queues are there and that they are accessible as executor queued_tasks. Similar was with \"running\". This does not have to be the case. For example in case of multiple executors there might be multiple queues and it is much better to define the interface as method rather than property being queue.\r\n> \r\n> It's just plain old encapsulation in the works. So we have now `executor.is_task_queued(self, task_instance_key: TaskInstanceKeyType))` instead of `task_instance_key in executor.queued`.\r\n> \r\n> This is not strictly needed now, but if we define other executors in the future, we might then abstract away from implementing those internal structures differently. And I already tested and had it implemented in MultipleExecutors case so i know it's a workable change.\r\n\r\nThe changes make sense, but just not the addition of the extra \"Protocol\" base class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/564002923/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/564004756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6772#issuecomment-564004756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6772","id":564004756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDAwNDc1Ng==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-10T12:10:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T12:10:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You

comment @baolsen \r\n\r\nFYI. We usually use rebase workflow during review rather than merge (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing). \r\n\r\nWhile this is not as intuitive initially as merge  (if you are used to it),  it is pretty well supported by Github (you can see snippets of old commits even if they are gone). This means that you have to often rebase on-top of master rather than have merge commits and get used to `push --force` for your own branch :).\r\n\r\nThis has great benefit of being able to keep even multiple commits separated in ine PR and continuously rebased on top of latest master - which (if you do it often and change is small) is rather easy. Thenn when we review the code we can also review them commit-by-commit even if eventually they will get squashed as single commit. Having merge commits in between your commits makes it rather difficult to review it commit-by-commit - you have no option but review all of it.\r\n\r\nAlso if you add `git commit --fixup` + `git rebase -i --autosquash` to the whole toolset you get some powerful workflow that allows you to keep your work logically separated into several commits and work on several commits at the same time.\r\n\r\nI switched to it few years ago and never looked back since.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/564180597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/564182397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6760#issuecomment-564182397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6760","id":564182397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDE4MjM5Nw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-10T19:01:54Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T19:02:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The changes make sense, but just not the addition of the extra \"Protocol\" base class.\r\n\r\nIt had much more sense when I implemented Multiple Executor.

If it is not, the --ff-only should cause it to fail (but this almost never happen - I did it once and regret it).\r\n\r\n> Update my fork's master:\r\n> git push -f origin\r\n> To keep my feature branch up to date:\r\n> git checkout\r\n> git rebase -i master\r\n> (squash into 1 commit per commit guidelines)\r\n> git push -f origin\r\n\r\nWhat I usually do to keep my feature branch is I rebase 'onto' the upstream/master branch. It needs a bit more consciousness to know where your commit  started. I look at git log and see the last commit before those that I want to rebase and I do `git rebase <hash_of_the_first_commit_I_do_not_want_to_rebase> --onto upstream/master`. It's a little more involved as you need to look up where you branched-off but it's usually pretty obvious.\r\n\r\n> Here is where I think I'm going wrong.\r\n> I had thought that exactly 1 commit was needed.\r\n\r\nDuring the review 1 commit is not needed - especially if you work incrementally and add fixups after review. This makes it easier to review as you apply fixes. So what I usually do is:\r\n`git commit --fixup HEAD` or `git commit --fixup <hash_of_the_commit_I_want_to_update>`. Then at some point of time it is enough to do `git rebase -j <hash-of-some-older-commit> --autosquash` and those fixups will be automatically joined with the commits they were fixing. But for review purpose I keep those fixup for some time so that reviewers can look only at the changes I made as result of the review.\r\n\r\n> So if I understand you correctly, the changes made because of code review should not be squashed into the first commit, i.e there should be 2+ commits as a result of the review process. 1 original, +1 for each review.\r\n> Then you (committers/maintainers) can squash them all again down to 1 commit when the PR gets merged.\r\n> \r\n> Is that roughly correct?\r\n\r\nCorrect. Or even better you can rebase + squash just before merge - which is a good practice as there might be for example new pre-commit checks added independently.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> For someone new to re-basing (and contributing in general) I did followed the contrib guide but it was a little unclear to me (also I once force pushed and lost changes to one of my first PRs :) . Anyway I was planning to clarify and add these detailed steps to the contrib guide to make it clearer for others, so really appreciate your feedback here :)\r\n\r\nI think we do not have  a \"standard\" workflow - we leave people quite a bit of freedom how they work. But maybe we should. Mine is just an example and is a bit involved and 'geeky'. Regarding losing changes - it's really hard to lose anything in git. Even if you force-push there is always `git reflog` to the rescue and you can checkout any commit (by hash) you had in your local .git until it's garbage collected (which by default is 30 days or so). Learning reflog taught me to be a little more courageous when playing with git.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/564459089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/564463753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6457#issuecomment-564463753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6457","id":564463753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDQ2Mzc1Mw==","user":{"login":"OmerJog","id":44576851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTc2ODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44576851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog","html_url":"https://github.com/OmerJog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T09:50:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T09:50:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sekikn

This was voted in AIP-21 / case #6. All rules is available in [GCP Service Airflow Integration Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_rTdJSLCt0eyrAylmmgYc3yZr-_h51fVlnvMmWqhCkY/edit?ts=5bb72dfd#heading=h.d8ueq9nksq0c) in `Naming conventions` chapter.\r\n\r\nWe have a plan that introduces conventions for all GCP integrations. Our main goal is to provide a uniform experience when using any GCP operator. It is worth adding that this name is unique because there are several KMS services, but only the service from Google is called \"**Cloud**KMS\". This change is backward compatible and people who use the old name could still use it without problems. We have tests that verify that the operator is working from an old and new path. If the old path is used, a deprecation warning is also checked.\r\n\r\nIf you have further questions, I will be happy to answer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/565110244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/565124089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6359#issuecomment-565124089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6359","id":565124089,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTEyNDA4OQ==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T18:19:30Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T18:19:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
