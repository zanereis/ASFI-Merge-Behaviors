Really interesting question.\r\n\r\nAn example Domain use case could be the following:\r\n\r\nImagine end users want 2 different ways to instantiate a Book:\r\n- The \"fast\" one, requiring only to enter a name and an ISBN, the only mandatory properties on that Domain.\r\n- The \"complete\" one, allowing in addition to the previous ones, to also enter a description, a reference to the Author and more optional data at the very moment you're instantiating the Entity.\r\n\r\nBasically we could have something like:\r\n\r\npublic class BookRepository {\r\n  public Book createBook(final String ISBN, final String name);\r\n  public Book createBookFromAuthor(final String ISBN, final String name, final Author author);\r\n  public Book createBookForArchiving(final String ISBN, final String name, final String description, final Date edition, ...);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nWith different \"create\" methods depending on the domain use cases to implement.\r\nInternally, they could reference the \"fast\" one to delegate base implementation and set additional properties for each derived use case.\r\n\r\nFrom the domain perspective, as far as I would understand it, we would have different Factory Methods from the domain perspective.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, in CDI we could use the @Describes annotation with Qualifiers, as there would be different methods that could implement objects of the same Class and we would need to disambiguate.\r\nBut on this example they're effectively creating an instance of the same Book class.\r\n\r\nHere is the \"user\" that selects (for \"problem solvers\") on (or follows for \"process followers\") each use case one specific implementation.\r\n\r\nAs current UI generated by Isis is more oriented towards \"problem solvers\", giving users the different actions, menus, etc. available, if we annotate in some way all methods that from the Domain perspective can be used to instantiate the Book class from the user's perspective, we can, for example, show all them to the user when a reference must be entered of a given class, allowing to select a previously existing instance or a new one.\r\nExemplyfing it, imagine we show on the modal dialog invoking an action, for each param that can reference a Book, a drop-down menu with all the previous 3 options, giving the user the opportunity to select an existing Book or create a new one right in that very moment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that behaviour (showing the sub-menu with known factory methods) can be the default one for all params in action dialogs, and perhaps it needs to be avoided by something like @Param(showFactoryMethods=false) - being the default value \"true\" -.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, would you consider these factory methods a \"domain\" issue rather than a \"technical\" one - like CDI, where the annotation would inject new instances automatically -?\r\n\r\nDespite that, I never thought of using the @Produces annotation for this and think can be a good solution for the most common use case. \r\nThe equivalent could be then a menu for all Qualifiers for the @Produces associated with the Entity class.\r\n \r\nSorry for the extension ...\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/337356212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/337410188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/causeway/pull/55#issuecomment-337410188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/55","id":337410188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzQxMDE4OA==","user":{"login":"andi-huber","id":17565970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY1OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17565970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber","html_url":"https://github.com/andi-huber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-17T23:38:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-17T23:38:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Oscar, I think I now better understand, what you actually had in mind with these factory-method-markers.

Naming of tests is something we had already identified for improvement and, in fact, the latest analysis includes these changes.\r\nAs an example:\r\n```public void org_apache_isis_applib_internal_base__Bytes_prepend_001_8ef33eec105cda50() throws Throwable {```\r\nis now:\r\n```public void prepend1() throws Throwable {```\r\n\r\n2. Deeptest software aims to identify all paths through the code and produces a test for each case. The idea is to maximize coverage and remove the possibility that an area of code is not covered. This means a large number of tests will be generated - these are compiled and run by the software with only those which pass being made available by default. It is not suggested that each of these is manually inspected because they represent the current working code and serve to track whether that original behaviour changes in the future (due to a bug or re-design)\r\n\r\n3. We do not currently support dependency injection but we are working on it and can let you know when it is available.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time. We would be happy to provide further tests for your consideration, after the naming and appearance-related changes which have been made recently, and to discuss any issues remaining you may have.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nPeter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/405887998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/408793554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/causeway/pull/115#issuecomment-408793554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/115","id":408793554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODc5MzU1NA==","user":{"login":"andi-huber","id":17565970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY1OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17565970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber","html_url":"https://github.com/andi-huber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-30T08:52:19Z","updated_at":"2018-07-30T08:52:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"no need to fix: \r\nsee dictionary for ref [1]\r\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/publically","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/408793554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/409151904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/causeway/pull/55#issuecomment-409151904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/55","id":409151904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTE1MTkwNA==","user":{"login":"andi-huber","id":17565970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY1OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17565970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber","html_url":"https://github.com/andi-huber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T09:11:17Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T09:11:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It has become unlikely, that this PR will every be merged.

think this PR is fine to merge.  \r\n\r\nTo me it seems that mostly this is just moving functionality about ... the OidAdapterMap and PojoAdapterMap are still present, but relocated to ObjectAdapterContext.\r\n\r\nThe most significant change is that ObjectAdapter#rootOid is now final, and so the replacePojo stuff has gone, instead the ObjectAdapter is copied if the rootOid changes.  This seems ok to me - or at least will be once we get to the stage where ObjectAdapters are instantiated as required and then discarded immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe ObjectAdapterProvider#specificationForViewModel(...) - which returns an ObjectAdapter - looks a bit odd; I've created a separate comment for that.  I suspect this is work in progress so happy to see how it plays out, but this code does look weird at the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/418609089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/419387901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/causeway/pull/121#issuecomment-419387901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/121","id":419387901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTM4NzkwMQ==","user":{"login":"danhaywood","id":1031625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzE2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1031625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood","html_url":"https://github.com/danhaywood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danhaywood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T09:54:47Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T09:54:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not for this PR and maybe not for this issue/ticket either, but I had another thought about ObjectAdapters, which you might want to mull on.\r\n\r\nAs you know, we also have the ability to wrap domainObjects, used for testing and for emitting events when calling a method action from another class.  One thing we've said we'd like to do (Oscar Bou pushed for this, they do this as a matter of course in their app) is to automatically wrap all domain objects.  The wrapper then ensures that the object's invariants are not violated.  We had ideas of maybe relaxing this rule for calls from \"within\" the module (however we define a module), but always enforcing it for inter-module calls.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it occurs to me that maybe the functionality that's within ObjectAdapter could instead be moved into the wrapper object.  As mentioned in another comment on this PR, the ByteBuddy/Javassist creates a subclass and can mix-in other interfaces for the wrapped object to implement - namely WrappingObject.  This is currently a marker interface, but it could instead have the responsibilities of ObjectAdapter, eg to obtain the oid and the ObjectSpecification.  In other words, the domainObject and the ObjectAdapter would in effect be the same object.  (Actually, since WrappingObject is in the applib, probably we would have a further subtype which is visible only to the runtime, eg \"WrappingObjectRuntime\")\r\n\r\nThis would then mean that wherever today we pass around an ObjectAdapter, instead we would pass around a WrappingObjectRuntime.\r\n\r\nAnyway, something to mull over.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/419387901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/419392104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/causeway/pull/121#issuecomment-419392104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/121","id":419392104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTM5MjEwNA==","user":{"login":"andi-huber","id":17565970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY1OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17565970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber","html_url":"https://github.com/andi-huber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-07T10:10:47Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T10:10:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Regarding 'wrapping every domain-object': Seems a very interesting approach to me.
