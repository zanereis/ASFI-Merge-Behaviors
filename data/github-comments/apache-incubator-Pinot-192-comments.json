I found that it allocated a lot of anonymous memory, each with 6x MB. After using gdb to dump these memory regions, I found my data for a column.\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the code, I discovered that ColumnValueReader implements the Closeable interface, but DataFetcher put it into a map. Will it automatically call the close method sometime?\r\n\r\nIf no one invokes these close methods, the direct memory allocated by ChunkReaderContext will not be freed.

Should we always rely on the async cleanup and remove the sync cleanup (assuming listing files is expensive)? I can see we can integrate more clean up logic into this periodic task in the future. Also, let's make the periodic task name more generic for future prove\r\n> 2. Do we create temp file for non-split-commit scenario?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor question 1, I already ensured the sync cleanup will be skipped if async deletion is enabled.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (!isTmpSegmentAsyncDeletionEnabled()) \r\n      try {\r\n        for (String uri : pinotFS.listFiles(tableDirURI, false)) {\r\n          if (uri.contains(SegmentCompletionUtils.getSegmentNamePrefix(segmentName))) {\r\n            LOGGER.warn(\"Deleting temporary segment file: {}\", uri);\r\n            Preconditions.checkState(pinotFS.delete(new URI(uri), true), \"Failed to delete file: %s\", uri);\r\n```\r\n\r\nRename it as TmpSegmentCleaner? From my point of view, have a dedicated class for a specific job is more modular and gets better parallel. Put multiple tasks into the same Thread.run() code will result a lot of if/else, try/catch logic. For example, the failure of task1 should not block task2.\r\n\r\nFor question 2, I need to inspect the source code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1635074752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1635074890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10915#issuecomment-1635074890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10915","id":1635074890,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5hdUNK","user":{"login":"deemoliu","id":15416419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDE2NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15416419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu","html_url":"https://github.com/deemoliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deemoliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-14T00:07:10Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T21:43:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> When removing segment, should we check the watermark and skip removing metadata?\r\n\r\nI think so. since we don't have any way to skip when replacing. we can add the check and skip removing metadata.\r\nthese metadata will be removed in the RemoveexpiredPrimaryKey() ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1635074890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1635088064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11076#issuecomment-1635088064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11076","id":1635088064,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5hdXbA","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-14T00:28:52Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T00:28:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah I run dependency:tree it doesn't seem like it is there.

However, since the Java heap pressure is not heavy, it seems like this would take quite a long time. I discovered that there exists a Java option, `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`, which can limit the total allocated off-heap memory. The default value is set to the heap's maximum memory, which means that when I set `-Xmx24G`, it could use a total of 48GB of memory and lead to an OOM (out of memory) error. After I set `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=4G`, everything seems fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, after setting this option, I encountered an OutOfMemory issue when running a large query. I think explicitly closing the ColumnValueReaders could help with running large queries. For now, I set `deriveNumDocsPerChunkForRawIndex=true` for the large JSON column, and the uncompressed chunk size will be smaller, allowing for smaller DirectByteBuffers to be allocated. Currently, everything is running smoothly (except running large queries such as select whole JSON column from Trino).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1635724282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1635731992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11110#issuecomment-1635731992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11110","id":1635731992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5hf0oY","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-14T11:34:15Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T11:41:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11110?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#11110](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11110?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (d39f70f) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/35d7a8faa5e969602a637a68f158c51fdc594c38?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (35d7a8f) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master   #11110      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage    0.11%    0.11%   -0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files        2203     2204       +1     \n  Lines      118165   118326     +161     \n  Branches    17879    17912      +33     \n==========================================\n  Hits          137      137              \n- Misses     118008   118169     +161     \n  Partials       20       20              \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1temurin11 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin17 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin20 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin11 | `?` | |\n| integration2temurin17 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin20 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin11 | `0.00% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1temurin17 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin20 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin11 | `0.11% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2temurin17 | `0.11% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2temurin20 | `0.11% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
