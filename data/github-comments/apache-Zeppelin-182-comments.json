For scoped mode interpreters or isolated mode or per note interpreters, each user/note could have their own interpreter instance and so the interpreter page may not be the best place to capture that. With %conf interpreter, now the admin could also consider locking down the interpreter page in order to prevent global interpreter restarts etc. With admin/user level settings locking down that page would be more important. So user visible setting may be better off where they are most applicable. On the notebook.

thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nThe thought here was to make the best of a bad situation. If and when the `delete()` fails, no recovery action is possible at the user level. So the only further action left is to notify the run-time-library that we are no longer interested in the file, and that the RTL should try to delete it if possible at some logical point in time (process exit). \r\n\r\nThe orphaned file will not be automatically overwritten later because `File.createTempFile(...)` will always attempt to create a new filename that is unused in the directory.\r\n\r\nThis is probably an obscure corner case without major negative consequences when handled either way. It is also likely impossible to test in a repeatable way. \r\n\r\nMy only motivation for this addition was to silence the Intellij IDE's warning that the return value of `delete()` had been ignored, but I think there are no technical errors in the overall logic.

looks like there's many misunderstandings between people about what the status icon really means.  Personally I would suggest to abandon this PR for now, as I think end users would also has the confusion about what that icon really means. status icon is nice to have but not must to have, so before we nail down what that status icon represent, we should not deliver such kind of feature. \r\nWhat user really care about is that when the interpreter fails to start, zeppelin frontend should tell the end user what's wrong and what should be done to fix that.

for the input @prabhjyotsingh. \r\n\r\nAllow me to list the advantages of both methods, and to suggest a possible way forward for your consideration.\r\n\r\n1) **The legacy method has two big advantages**:\r\na) It is well known, so making it disappear without notice will be a very unpleasant jolt to all existing users.\r\nb) Being always available, it is usable when either the grid or any visualization is displayed.\r\n\r\n2) **The ui-grid menu approach has the following advantages**:\r\na) It does not suffer from the problems mentioned in the [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3511) - though one of them has been fixed.\r\nb) It allows downloading to an Excel file as well.\r\nc) Being based on a 3rd party package, the support effort will be less, and periodic enhancements can be expected automatically.\r\n\r\nConsidering everything, it would seem that the advantage in 1(a) will be the main loss. The loss of 1(b) will become acceptable once users are familiar with the new method, as users can switch to the grid to download data.\r\n\r\nIf we agree to move progressively towards the ui-grid menu approach (without confusing users who are familiar with the legacy method) the following could be an option:\r\n\r\nIn place of the legacy method button and dropdown we add a label with a tool-tip popup that informs the user where the data-download method has moved. This informative label can be maintained for one or two releases, by when all users will be familiar with the new menu. The label can then be removed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/397615485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/397785641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3013#issuecomment-397785641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3013","id":397785641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzc4NTY0MQ==","user":{"login":"sanjaydasgupta","id":477015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzAxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/477015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta","html_url":"https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-16T04:24:08Z","updated_at":"2018-06-16T04:24:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please see my suggestion (described above) implemented in the image below.
