This is now a feature branch and is broken up as you requested, so it is the sum of all things.\r\n\r\n@mattf-horton : I would request, if you are comfortable doing so, moving your implicit +1 for this code to an explicit +1 on this pr to give the option of getting the feature branch moving, as this effort has again stagnated for weeks.  If you feel your prior review is obsolete because of the changes for merging contexts and the new testing sample code and documentation added to address review comments, that is understandable.  My question then is how we handle that.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how we want to proceed here.  The stated idea was if this were broken up into smaller chunks, we would take the already reviewed first chunk and be able to reasonably quickly get that landed to move things alone.  That has not happened.  I have done further work to make this a feature branch, which I think is correct, and gets us, in the end and after much work to where we would have wanted to be at the start, a clean feature branch with broken down submittals.  I am out of things I can do with this to make it more reviewable.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/357264215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/357266201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/884#issuecomment-357266201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/884","id":357266201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzI2NjIwMQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-12T15:20:47Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T15:20:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do we have jiras for the next steps on this yet?

Right now we do not have an approach to take a list of stellar expressions that are assignments, a variable resolver, a function resolver and execute that list of statements in a way that variables are updated.
