Currently we do fail out when folks attempt to write unsourced data during a CTAS statement on older spark releases.

I added that in [SPARK-43088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43088). There should be no use case where we would not request a hash distribution for a partitioned table by default (row-level operations, transforms, etc). That means users would have to explicitly override the distribution mode to get into such a situation. If it happens, they probably are OK with the number of produced files, which would be the same with both writers? The only difference is a local sort that can spill vs keeping a row group per seen partition.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1732211168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1732222090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7628#issuecomment-1732222090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7628","id":1732222090,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85nP5yK","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-23T05:43:20Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T05:43:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@linyanghao I left a few comments. can you also rebase?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1732222090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1732251151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8012#issuecomment-1732251151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8012","id":1732251151,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85nQA4P","user":{"login":"JonasJ-ap","id":55990951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTkwOTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55990951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap","html_url":"https://github.com/JonasJ-ap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-23T08:18:04Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T08:18:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Based on offline discussion,this PR will continue in https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8622.

The highest or lowest value is byte array which can be variable length, lets commonly lets bound those values at 256 bytes.  The `field_id` also won't be greater than 8 bytes in length (commonly it will be shorter due to zigzag encoding).  So for a table of 200 columns lets try:\r\n\r\n8 bytes (field_id) * 256 bytes (value length) * 200 (column count) = 409,600 bytes.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear your thoughts on this, but 1 MB seems like a reasonable first guess, until we make it a table property.
