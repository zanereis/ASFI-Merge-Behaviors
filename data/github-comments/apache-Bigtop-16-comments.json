I checked https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/How+to+Contribute but it doesn't seem up to date afaics, what is the best procedure?\r\n- Can we merge from the Github mirror UI? (If so I don't find a way to do it)\r\n- Should we merge from Gitbox's UI?\r\n- Alternatively, merge + push from the gitbox local repo, but I suspect that there is a simpler way.\r\nIn this case I'd like to merge this change on the master branch, and if it applies cleanly, also on branch-1.5 (people will need to rebuild oozie for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-3621).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/999332388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/999410417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/846#issuecomment-999410417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/846","id":999410417,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M47kcrx","user":{"login":"elukey","id":1536240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzYyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1536240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey","html_url":"https://github.com/elukey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elukey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-22T09:10:27Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T09:33:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\n$ dpkg -c output/oozie/oozie_4.3.0-1_all.deb | grep log4j\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root      6129 2021-12-22 08:56 ./etc/oozie/conf.dist/oozie-log4j.properties\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root    448794 2021-12-22 08:17 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/apache-log4j-extras-1.2.17.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root    208235 2021-12-22 08:54 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/log4j-1.2-api-2.17.0.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root    489884 2021-12-22 08:14 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/log4j-1.2.17.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root    301776 2021-12-22 08:16 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/log4j-api-2.17.0.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root   1789339 2021-12-22 08:16 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/log4j-core-2.17.0.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root     24252 2021-12-22 08:48 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/log4j-slf4j-impl-2.17.0.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root     35920 2021-12-22 08:48 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/log4j-web-2.17.0.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- root/root      9711 2021-12-22 08:14 ./usr/lib/oozie/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.6.6.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to run the Smoke tests but they are currently failing even with the \"official\" oozie version 4.3.0-1.\r\nEdit: after some logs checking I realized that the smoke tests need hive to be deployed on the docker provisioner, tests in progress.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/999410417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/999423213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/845#issuecomment-999423213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/845","id":999423213,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M47kfzt","user":{"login":"oflebbe","id":1179001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe","html_url":"https://github.com/oflebbe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oflebbe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-22T09:28:50Z","updated_at":"2021-12-22T09:28:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I was in \"At Work Mode\" when I did the Github review, I was supposed to use JIRA for Reviews.\r\nHowever AFAIK the gitbox / github integration should work the same as committing the usual way directly on the ASF infra, but I have to admit I used the \"usual way\" (as in the How to Contribute) before.
