I think we need to fix this.\n\n@jklukas We currently expose the metrics through `ProcessorContext` to let users specify latency metrics for their customized metrics; thinking it a bit more, I agree that it is better to expose this metrics as well for defining the sensors, and the same metrics object can then be used inside a `Processor` for recording the sensor. Does this sounds good to you?\n\nAlso since this is not a minor change, could you file a JIRA as well and explain the motivation / etc? Some related issues that I have been thinking, which we can see whether or not we should include in the JIRA or in a separate one:\n1. The `StreamsMetrics` interface limit user's ability to define other metrics rather than latency, etc. We can consider let context.metrics() to return the `org.apache.kafka.common.metrics.Metrics` directly in order to allow users define any sensors following the same way as we do in `StreamsMetricsImpl`.\n2. We can consider adding metrics for process / punctuate / commit rate at the granularity of each processor node in addition to the global rate mentioned above. This is very helpful in debugging.\n3. We can consider adding rate / total cumulated metrics for context.forward indicating how many records were forwarded downstream from this processor node as well. This is helpful in debugging.\n4. We can consider adding metrics for each stream partition's timestamp. This is helpful in debugging.\n5. Besides the latency metrics, we can also add throughput latency in terms of source records consumed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218326690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218328231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1364#issuecomment-218328231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1364","id":218328231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODMyODIzMQ==","user":{"login":"Ishiihara","id":1189848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODk4NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara","html_url":"https://github.com/Ishiihara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiihara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T00:10:35Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T00:10:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma I think it is a good practice to use the double quotes if we are unsure about whether there are spaces or not. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218328231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218328320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1359#issuecomment-218328320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1359","id":218328320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODMyODMyMA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T00:11:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T00:11:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218328320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218328762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1364#issuecomment-218328762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1364","id":218328762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODMyODc2Mg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T00:14:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T00:14:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Someone who is more of an expert in shell scripting should probably review this.

The main effect I'm hoping for is being able to define health checks for my application based on streams metrics.\n\n> We currently expose the metrics through ProcessorContext to let users specify latency metrics for their customized metrics; thinking it a bit more, I agree that it is better to expose this metrics as well for defining the sensors, and the same metrics object can then be used inside a Processor for recording the sensor. Does this sounds good to you?\n\nHaving the same metrics registry available from the KafkaStreams instance and from the ProcessorContext sounds good.\n\n---\n\nSounds like scope of what needs to change is bigger than I thought.

Or do we expect this patch to only affect autocommits? \n\nI'm also wondering about an alternative implementation which avoids the additional complexity in `SubscriptionState` by sending an asynchronous commit in `KafkaConsumer.subscribe()` prior to changing the subscription when autocommit is enabled.

I am likely overlooking the details, but to me whether we are autocommitting or not we would want to properly keep track of whatever is consumed and so their offsets (former and current subscriptions alike) should be committed every time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218598927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218601645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1364#issuecomment-218601645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1364","id":218601645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODYwMTY0NQ==","user":{"login":"granders","id":1295932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders","html_url":"https://github.com/granders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T21:53:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T21:53:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This seems fine to me, unless we also want to also add the fix KAFKA-1508.\nKafka system tests pass on this branch (these use bin scripts quite a bit), as does a run of confluent platform tests which uses this branch of kafka.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218601645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218603833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/922#issuecomment-218603833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/922","id":218603833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODYwMzgzMw==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T22:02:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T22:02:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma With the old consumers gradually being phased out do you think this PR (from a while back) is still worth merging as is?

We'll have to be very careful in the documentation to make sure this expectation is clear. I would slightly prefer keeping the assignment consistent with the offset commits so that user can always tell exactly which offsets will be committed in a given call to the commit API. \n\nThis is why I suggested the change to use an async commit in `subscribe()` when autocommit is enabled. It maintains the current invariants as far as consistency between the assignment and offset commits, and it addresses the main problem from this JIRA, which is basically that users will see duplicates when they change subscriptions with autocommit enabled. For users who are using manual commit, they will have to call `commitSync()` prior to changing their subscription, but that seems reasonable to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218605126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218605498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1362#issuecomment-218605498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1362","id":218605498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODYwNTQ5OA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T22:09:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T22:09:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jklukas About the scope of this JIRA: it is up to you :) It'll will definitely great if you would like to take on this general \"sub-project\" for improving the metrics, but I also do not want to drag you into this if your time does not permits or you are not interested.

is in the

There are several potentially independent ideas here, though, so I will plan to create a few follow-up JIRA issues to discuss where this should go.\n\nTo clear, I'd like to break off discussion of the following to separate channels:\n- The `Metrics` instance is currently not being closed. I've opened #1379 to address that.\n- We are currently missing some opportunities for per-node metrics and other metric additions. I will plan to open a JIRA issue to discuss this.\n- Users can currently only add latency sensors due to the StreamsMetrics interface. Should they have access to the main metrics registry? I'll open a separate JIRA issue for this.\n\n---\n\nSo, this PR is still focused on the idea of exposing a read-only map of internal Kafka Streams metrics. As mentioned in the JIRA, this could be useful for developers defining health checks for their Kafka Streams application.\n\nI'd expect a `KafkaStreams.metrics()` method to return an unmodifiable map (as implemented in this PR) because we already have that convention for producers and consumers.\n\n@guozhangwang - Do you think we might want to reserve `KafkaStreams.metrics` to return something else (a `StreamsMetrics` instance or the `Metrics` instance directly)? If so, then I'll close this PR for now in favor or further discussion of the design in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3701\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218798098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218804042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1378#issuecomment-218804042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1378","id":218804042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODgwNDA0Mg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T16:02:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T16:02:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218804042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218810714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1379#issuecomment-218810714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1379","id":218810714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODgxMDcxNA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T16:25:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T16:25:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The change looks good although it would be good to add a unit test.

And I'm also realizing that I'm not sure what I'd have a test do for this `close()` method.\n\nThere's some prior art in `KafkaProducerTest` that we could possibly mimic, but that would likely require creating `MockMetrics` and potentially a mock for the StreamThread array. We might not even be able to make that work because the metrics and threads members are private, so not available to substitute mocks. There may be mechanisms to inject mocks for private variables that I'm not currently aware of, though.\n\nIs this blocked without adding a unit test for `close`?

@gwenshap @ijuma @theduderog Thanks for all the reviews and suggestions. I made the suggested modifications and add quotes to all variables in all scripts. However, with this change, we do see some unexpected behaviors:\n1.  In `zookeeper-server-start.sh` and `kafka-server-start.sh`, we set `KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS` with the following code snippet:\n\n```\nif [ \"x$KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS\" = \"x\" ]; then\n   export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS=\"-Xmx512M -Xms512M\"\nfi\n```\n\nIf we double quote `KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS` in `kafka-run-class.sh`, Java treats \"-Xmx512M -Xms512M\" as one configuration and reports that it can not recognize that and fails to start JVM. \n2. Same issue with `$EXTRA_ARGS` in `kakfa-server-start.sh`\n\nTo avoid unexpected behavior, we decided to roll back to  https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/dda32ccbbd3300912c8ed05b02b0939260c04d22\nas this commit passes both Kafka system test and muckrake tests. \n\nTo ensure that the changes are working @granders and I did a couple of manual tests. The things I did includes the following:\n1. Run every scripts under bin directory with source build and ensure that they are running property\n2. Run every scripts under the release tar ball and ensure that they are running property\n3. Passing in external CLASSPATH with wildcard and ensures that it is included in the final CLASSPATH. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218920767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/218923386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1363#issuecomment-218923386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1363","id":218923386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODkyMzM4Ng==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T00:32:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T00:34:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji @becketqin I am trying to write unit tests for the updated approach, but am having some issues.
