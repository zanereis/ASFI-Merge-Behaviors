I\ndon't know the ratio of people having access to Adobe Illustrator, but\nI would prefer tools directly working on the SVG code.\n\nIf needed for example with pure SVG code, we could transform the files\nat build time and strip comments and so on.\n\nHowever, Apache is pretty clear, that files, that can carry the license\nheader should (very hard should) carry it. For SVG files this is the\ncase. If Adobe Illustrator is not able to add a fixed comment\n(apparantly it can, as there is already one), additional tooling needs\nto do it (adding an XML comment will not be hard).\n\n> (Besides, SVG icons, which are loaded at runtime, will become about\n> 25% larger on average if we add a license comment to each.

For\ntranscoding to PNG I got a penalty of 4%. With caching this is a one-\noff problem. Seinng the SVG-PNG comparison, this speed problem looks\nnot significant.\n\nThe size itself IMHO is not problem - if it is, run the files through\ngzip and decompress von the fly.\n\n\nAm Samstag, den 08.06.2019, 20:41 -0700 schrieb Jaroslav Tulach:\n> > I'm curious which apps use the platform and would use a modern\n> > Apache NetBeans Platform\n> > version but wouldn't want to support HiDPI screens?\n> \n> ... we are talking about the NetBeans Runtime Container.
