Would you tell me more about the motivation of this PR? Currently, the stale pendingSegments are computed by `created time of most recent running task (or complete task if there is no running task) - P1D`. I thought this is safe because 1) when a task is already finished, it's safe to delete all pendingSegments created by that task and 2) when a task is running, its pendingSegments is never deleted by the coordinator. Is there a use case where a flexible retention period is required?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/605113377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/605113395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9184#issuecomment-605113395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9184","id":605113395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTExMzM5NQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T17:00:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T17:00:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is no longer marked as stale.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/605113395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/605116266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8663#issuecomment-605116266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8663","id":605116266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTExNjI2Ng==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T17:05:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T17:05:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I forgot about this issue. @teeram, @yangliang9004, @1ambda would you please give more contexts about your environment?

It seems that regardless of whether a multi value was inserted into a column or not, this storage adapter sets all string columns to be multi value.\r\n\r\ne.g. for the example above while it hasn't been persisted a query for segment metadata results in this:\r\n\r\n`            \"currency\": {\r\n                \"cardinality\": 2, \r\n                \"errorMessage\": null, \r\n                \"hasMultipleValues\": true, \r\n                \"maxValue\": \"GBP\", \r\n                \"minValue\": \"EUR\", \r\n                \"size\": 0, \r\n                \"type\": \"STRING\"\r\n            } `\r\n\r\nWhereas the persisted data returns hasMultipleValues correctly as false, it seems this results in inconsistencies when using any kind of string function against a dimensional column that has not yet been persisted vs data that has been persisted. So I think this problem is bigger than just the above report.\r\n\r\nI verified this by amending the following to return false and this then correctly returns just a string value instead of an array. However I'm aware this may break multi-values on ingestion?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/incremental/IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter.java#L166\r\n\r\nHappy to take a look further if anyone can offer any advice as to how to tackle this problem.

I think it's better to split them because \r\n\r\n1) the configurations will be still non-nulls and thus you don't have to add null checks everywhere which  is less error-prone.\r\n2) the error will be still thrown during the initialization instead of when a relevant method is called while the cluster is running. This could matter because it would be nice to fail fast when some configuration is accidentally wrong so that users don't have to restart the cluster whenever they find wrong configurations.\r\n3) if we unify all extension inputSources as a separate extension, users can just choose the new extension to use all input source types which is better than listing all different extensions in the load list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/606303285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/606304446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8621#issuecomment-606304446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8621","id":606304446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjMwNDQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T23:26:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T23:26:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Tiaaa thank you for the update.
