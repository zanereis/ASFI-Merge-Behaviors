And I understand your need.\r\n\r\nBut we seem to try to add a new generic feature that we might have to support in all future versions of Airflow. If people start using it - we should be careful because that feature can be used in totally unexpected ways. I can imagine (for example) someone implementing a round-robin script that assigns different `sql_alchemy_conn` to different instances in order to distribute traffic across several databases (been there, done that). While this is pretty powerful, it's also super dangerous for maintenance and support of a product. I am pretty sceptical when in a product we say \"and here we can run any script with arbitrary complexity to achieve whatever user wants\". That does not seem right because people will abuse it and product will have to support it indefinitely. \r\n\r\nI don't like the \"over-generic\" approach here - seems we are killing a fly with a cannon gun (as we say in Polish). But again - this is more to start discussion than to completely abandon that approach. Maybe I am wrong and others have other opinion. I would love to hear what others think (@ashb , @kaxil, @feluelle, @Fokko, @dimberman., @mik-laj ?). Maybe that qualifies for devlist discussion and should be moved there?\r\n\r\nI totally agree that we should never keep many secrets in the same config file together with other settings, but my question is - why do you want to keep secrets in the .cfg file (or in your case in ENV variable) at all? Are there  settings that you want to be kept secret that you cannot set otherwise? Which ones? \r\n\r\nCurrently the default way for airflow to keep the connection secrets is to store them in connection database (which for the security reason can be encrypted with symmetric Fernet Key and the secrets are not visible via the UI) - not to keep them in .cfg file nor in environment variables (the environment variables are just a convenience to allow mostly testing and debugging). This is also security-by-obscurity in a way (but protects from revealing the password in case someone gets just access to the DB). Maybe we should have similar approach for anything that is secret and comes from the .cfg file currently instead? But maybe we could use some of the \"vault\" apis instead-  whether via secrets in Kubernetes, or KMS, ApacheVault etc - we had discussion about it in the devlist I recall. Maybe that's a better approach?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/566581583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/566583717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6633#issuecomment-566583717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6633","id":566583717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjU4MzcxNw==","user":{"login":"yuqian90","id":6637585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mzc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6637585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqian90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqian90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-17T15:12:13Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T15:12:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Can we add a section with example somwhere in docs too in https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/concepts.rst or https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/master/docs/howto\r\n\r\nThanks @kaxil. @ashb  also suggested separately to add a doc page.

You can already achieve the same behaviour by providing an airflow.cfg file that has a _cmd option calling a script. You could even write the full script as a one-liner in the _cmd option. This patch only makes the process smoother and logical from the \"you can override options with env vars\" point of view.\r\n\r\nPlus, think of it as a way to enable convention over configuration for sensitive data in the Helm chart. One could modify the existing Helm templates and values to standardize the mount path of secrets in Airflow containers, instead of setting multiple environment variables with clear-text sensitive data in the Helm values (see the airflow.mapenvsecrets Helm value in the [stable Helm Airflow chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/airflow) ). \r\n\r\nFor the moment the Helm values must be secured in some way because of those sensitive values.

@adityav It is actually a bit more than that. What it implies is that the heart beating is being throttled because of the high heart rate.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read the code to understand how to silence this line. This line is called in the loop whenever `time_since_last_heartbeat` is smaller than `self.heartrate`. But since the code only sleeps for `self.heartrate - time_since_last_heartbeat`, and then the loop goes to the next iteration. So if the worker is fast enough, there's bound to be a small variation when `time_since_last_heartbeat` is computed again. It is most likely going to be smaller than `self.heartrate`. So this line keeps spamming. There seems to be no way to stop this.

> I'm trying to read the code to understand how to silence this line. This line is called in the loop whenever `time_since_last_heartbeat` is smaller than `self.heartrate`. But since the code only sleeps for `self.heartrate - time_since_last_heartbeat`, and then the loop goes to the next iteration. So if the worker is fast enough, there's bound to be a small variation when `time_since_last_heartbeat` is computed again. It is most likely going to be smaller than `self.heartrate`. So this line keeps spamming. There seems to be no way to stop this.

You can write `airflow config > second config.cfg` to save current configuration. It was not the scope of this PR to add additional commands that allow debugging path configurations. These paths should also not be displayed in the same command, because they will cause it to not be a valid INI file and can cause confusion among users because this file has long output, so finding path information in long output can be problematic.  Can you add an independent PR that will add your new command?

a question - if we are going to change - why don't we change to pnpm instead. It seems it's  relatively new but stable/recommended package managers for node. And I like the output of it even more than yarn's. Also it shares downloaded packages via symbolic/hard links to .pnpm directory thus saving space.\r\n\r\nIt also has saner (than npm) commands (similar to yarn):\r\n```\r\npnpm install --frozen-lockfile\r\n``` \r\nrather than \r\n```\r\nnpm ci\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also quite significantly faster.

This line is called in the loop whenever `time_since_last_heartbeat` is smaller than `self.heartrate`. But since the code only sleeps for `self.heartrate - time_since_last_heartbeat`, and then the loop goes to the next iteration. So if the worker is fast enough, there's bound to be a small variation when `time_since_last_heartbeat` is computed again. It is most likely going to be smaller than `self.heartrate`. So this line keeps spamming. There seems to be no way to stop this. And this line is also not useful because it basically says the task is still heartbeating.\r\n> > ```\r\n> >                     self.log.warning(\"Time since last heartbeat(%.2f s) < heartrate(%s s)\"\r\n> >                                      \", sleeping for %s s\", time_since_last_heartbeat,\r\n> >                                      self.heartrate, sleep_for)\r\n> > ```\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > How about changing it to self.log.trace() or remove it completely?\r\n> \r\n> @yuqian90\r\n> The logging level was set to `debug` in #6716\r\n\r\nI see.
