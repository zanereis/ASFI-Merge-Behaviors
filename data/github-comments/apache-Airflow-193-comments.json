I think it would be a good idea to store this per DagRun. Versioned versions of the graph would introduce another layer of complexity, and this is an attempt to reduce the complexity of the logic to bring everything to one single place (the database).\r\nHaving good indices on the tables would be okay in my opinion. I think the number of DagRuns would typically be in the order of thousands, maybe up to a million, the number of Edges would be a couple of million at most then.\r\n\r\nAlso parsing huge DAGs involves a lot of complexity and processing power, so the idea is to do this only once, and then store it in the database using the right keys.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/456720871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/456727401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4476#issuecomment-456727401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4476","id":456727401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjcyNzQwMQ==","user":{"login":"OmerJog","id":44576851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTc2ODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44576851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog","html_url":"https://github.com/OmerJog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmerJog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-23T09:17:39Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T09:17:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is

From what I can see and have read from the description this is a contribution back for a breaking change that was made in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3740.  \r\nLooking through the original PR, the changes made that are causing issues with 'cmds' seems unrelated to the description of the original pull request and furthermore the original pull request doesn't have any tests, stating \"Tests updated (but not functionally)\".\r\n\r\nAs an open source project that to my knowledge is very well used now, I find it hard to believe that this kind of thing has been merged with comments outstanding such as \"The airflow command is not passed as a string anymore. I need some help in doing this properly for the k8s executor most likely\".\r\n\r\nAs the merge of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3740 has broken the K8 functionality, it seems that the correct action would be to revert those changes and re-implement with better testing in place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/457121093/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/457139006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4576#issuecomment-457139006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4576","id":457139006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzEzOTAwNg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T10:02:51Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T10:02:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Fokko The problem doesn't lie in Airflow itself, but many of our deps (Pandas, or Pendulum.
