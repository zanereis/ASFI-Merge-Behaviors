This would be more akin to what you said about keep the image up to date. However we stopped that approach mainly because the cause of growing number of images(and the cost of disk space), and potential broken dependencies which could cause CI outage\r\n\r\nCurrently we manually tag and stage the CI docker(by change the tag in the Jenkinsfile).  It also enables the CI worker to use a limited amount disk resources(as they always point to a version), as well as making reproducing error easier(as we always point to the same binary tag). Given that we do not change the CI env frequently, we find it is a better approach.\r\n\r\nThe drawback is of course there could be a lag between the docker script update and CI image. Right now we do that actively whenever we update the docker script, which works fine.  I believe specific instance for the CPU was due to the fact that there was an error of rust env that prevents us from updating the CPU docker, I will take a stab to see if we can sync it, but of course we will need to fix the testcase before that :)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541164023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541166354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4097#issuecomment-541166354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4097","id":541166354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTE2NjM1NA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T18:05:37Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T18:05:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See also https://docs.tvm.ai/contribute/pull_request.html#ci-environment","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541166354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541166868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3865#issuecomment-541166868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3865","id":541166868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTE2Njg2OA==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T18:07:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T18:07:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yzhliu @wweic @anijain2305 Just rebased with master.

If you find that this is a cause, adding an additional pass before low-level codegen that folds the common multiplication factors will likely resolve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541179985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541191379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3465#issuecomment-541191379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3465","id":541191379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTE5MTM3OQ==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T19:18:53Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T19:18:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Yes.

It is complete TensorCore support. It is nice that you can support different types and different data layouts, which is not supported in my solution currently.\r\n\r\n## Lower Passes vs Intrinsic\r\nIntrinsic is a tool for describing what instructions can be done in specific hardware. I believe TensorCore is one kind of specific hardware. It is perfect to use tensor intrinsic. It is standard and easy to maintain (if Nividia add another accelerator, we only need to add another intrinsic rather than a new pass)\r\n\r\nAnother thing is auto tensorization. Just as Tianqi says, our final goal is to generate schedules for all kinds of hardware using tensor intrinsics, which is my major work direction.\r\n\r\n## Suggestions and Questions\r\n- As we know using TensorCores will decrease precision. So, NVIDIA set up a switch to turn on and off TensorCores in CUBLAS and CUDNN (default not use TensorCores). At least we should let users determine whether use them.\r\n- In Volta Arichitecture Whitepaper, TensorCores do production in full precision, rather than half precision. I recommend changing the pattern into `A/B -> Load -> Cast -> Mul -> Add` if we still use pattern matching solution.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25500082/66683911-86c12880-ec2d-11e9-9b16-18dedae1f2fd.png)\r\n- It shocks me that your solution is even faster than CUBLAS and CUDNN. I try to reproduce the result but fails. Did you use BatchMatMul and BatchConv? And which GPU did you test on? Could you show me the details about the performance?\r\n\r\n## Combine with Tensor Intrinsics\r\nI am glad to see a different solution for TensorCore. And it seems that it is more complete and faster than mine. However, tensor intrinsic is the solution that Tianqi and I recommend. It would benefit the project and the community if we can cooperate, combining my tensor intrinsic and your complete and well-performance backend. \r\n\r\nAfter all, thank you again for this impressive RFC.

Neither do I know that CI is running on the appropriate hardware.\r\n\r\nIn general the testing infrastructure needs to now start adding run time checks for the presence of newer instructions and skip tests gracefully as we will have folks running tests on hardware that has the support for the new instructions and hardware that doesn't. I'll note this is also applicable for some of the new AArch64 dot product instructions going in.\r\n\r\n One way I've done this in other projects is to have a dummy program containing an inline assembler instruction in the new instruction family and figuring out a way of executing that before running the test. If you get a run time exception , catch it and skip it. This routine could become common in the test framework for tvm for such hardware checks of these features and thus just be kept common. \r\n\r\nI guess for now we either need to xfail this test or skip it entirely, unless the original contributor comes back or someone else can pick this up. \r\n\r\nregards\r\nRamana","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541259270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541261101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4038#issuecomment-541261101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4038","id":541261101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTI2MTEwMQ==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-12T00:08:55Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T00:08:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A gentle ping @llyfacebook  :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541261101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/541264362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4107#issuecomment-541264362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4107","id":541264362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTI2NDM2Mg==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-12T00:37:09Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T00:37:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will try to take a stab at this next week.

We are trying out some of your suggestions. Will have further discussions with you after we have made some evaluations and trials.\r\n\r\n> As we know using TensorCores will decrease precision. So, NVIDIA set up a switch to turn on and off TensorCores in CUBLAS and CUDNN (default not use TensorCores). At least we should let users determine whether use them.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether \"using TensorCores will decrease precision\", if the inputs are already in fp16 or int8. We did try to add an \"enable_tensor_core\" option in tvm.build_config, but it seems like build_config can't be passed to AutoTVM building. Any suggestion on where to add this option is welcome. But I think eventually we will not need this option, after the implementation is proven to be robust enough. For example, in Tensorflow, MatMul/Conv on fp16 data by default uses TensorCore Kernel of cublas/cudnn.\r\n\r\n> In Volta Arichitecture Whitepaper, TensorCores do production in full precision, rather than half precision. I recommend changing the pattern into A/B -> Load -> Cast -> Mul -> Add if we still use pattern matching solution.\r\n\r\nThanks for correcting my understanding.

I considered the possibility of including a header file twice where the registration happens. But we actually have not called the TVM's `Register` function from MXNet at all, and the error thrown out is on a packed function registered in the TVM codebase. Any idea where might be wrong? Please note that it only throws the error after MXNet is built with both gcc and nvcc. This is also the part that I don't understand.

We discussed the difference and similarity of our solutions. They are different in the front-end: our solution tries to make it as transparent as possible to make it easy-using while #4095 provides more controllability to the user (schedule developer). They are actually targeting different users, so we think both solutions can co-exist. But we both agreed that the intrinsics in the back-end should combine. As to the fragment allocation, we are OK to change from new_expr to the way of introducing new scopes, but currently the new scope introduced in #4052 is not enough for the codegen of fragment allocation if it's extended to support different warp tile sizes and data layouts (col_major/row_major). One possible but not so elegant solution we proposed is to extend the scopes to also include tile size and data layout. @Hzfengsy is also trying to figure out a solution here. We will have more discussions on this. \r\ncc @tqchen
