developer's convenience, I suggest setting `Spotless` executions configuration as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<executions>\r\n  <execution>\r\n      <goals>\r\n          <goal>apply</goal>\r\n      </goals>\r\n      <phase>compile</phase>\r\n  </execution>\r\n</executions>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, `Spotless` will automatically fix the style / formatting issues when compiling the project. However, we need to keep `Checkstyle` so that CI could make sure the style is correct in case developers do not compile and test the code before pushing it to remote repo.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to use `git pre-commit hook` and remove `Checkstyle`.

We can use java agent to read it before executing yarn job's JAR file, also, can take taskInstanceId as input of agent program. However, where to store this mapping relationship need to be further considered.\r\n> > Please let me know if you have any good suggestions!\r\n> \r\n> In fact, there is already a issue(#4025) talk about use agent to collect the appId, but I think it isn't a good way 😢 , we need to maintain a agent and we may need to maintain different version agant.\r\n\r\nI think there's no need to maintain different version agent, for example, we can parse the appId from some environment variables such as `APPLICATION_WEB_PROXY_BASE`. All yarn jobs' `AM` maintain this environment variable, i've already verified it in Flink, Spark, Hive, MR, Spark-SQL. The only difference is how to set java options which can be defined in each  type of task.\r\n\r\nSo, it seems like yarn jobs submitted by shell command can all get appId in this way. Anyway, there are some other design problems, like where to store the mapping relationship, as mentioned in issue([#4025](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4025)). I'll carefully think about that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1205251304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1205306443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11305#issuecomment-1205306443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11305","id":1205306443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5H14RL","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-04T14:05:47Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T14:05:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,

WDYT @kezhenxu94 @ruanwenjun\r\n> \r\n> I personally used pre-commit hook in my own project and I prefer to use this. Also even we have the hook we should still keep the style check in CI because that can be skipped in developers' local machine.\r\n\r\nI think it is a good point that we should check the style in CI in case users skip it.\r\n\r\nTo recap:\r\n\r\n1. Remove `Checkstyle` and only keep `Spotless` so that we will not need to maintain two style check files.\r\n2. Change the `execution goal` of `Spotless` from `apply` to `check` so that CI will check the style with `Spotless`.\r\n3. Encourage users to use `git pre-commit hook`.\r\n\r\nMay I ask there is any best practice for setting up `git pre-commit hook`? Should we provide users with a script to set it up or just give them a doc?

is a Far-reaching influence change, and maybe we should discussion it first. I have two way out of my mind\r\n\r\n1. we are already have https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/blob/bf5f7a88c5a7ef1c7772c6b9c5830fd72dc599ec/dolphinscheduler-python/pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/java_gateway.py#L30-L47, I think we should covert file into module(or keep file), and migrate all `gateway.entry_point.createTenant` call into this file or modules,\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef create_tenant(name, description, queue_name):\r\n    # we may also add some parameter verify before call\r\n    return gateway.entry_point.createTenant(name, description, queue_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand we only need to call function `create_tenant` when we need.\r\n\r\n2. we have `models` module in path https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/tree/dev/dolphinscheduler-python/pydolphinscheduler/src/pydolphinscheduler/models, and the `models` in python usually mean connection to data store system, we can take for all java gateway service is Python API DAO layer, and we migrate all `gateway.entry_point` call into module `modules`(create them if not exists)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1206348633/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1206375313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11324#issuecomment-1206375313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11324","id":1206375313,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5H59OR","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-05T12:10:28Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T12:10:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank
