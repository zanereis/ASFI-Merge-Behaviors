Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574235989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574255590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7160#issuecomment-574255590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7160","id":574255590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDI1NTU5MA==","user":{"login":"lokeshlal","id":3168965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjg5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3168965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal","html_url":"https://github.com/lokeshlal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lokeshlal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-14T16:23:09Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T16:27:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > The other thing you will need to do is add support for this column in to the Serialized DAG format.\r\n> > We should add this as an (optional) field in to `airflow/serialization/schema.json` and most things should be handled already.

Thanks for contribution. Currently I have couple of long term running clusters and i used to do same what you do. I was listing clusters and filtering by name. But that was resulted in throttling exception from AWS API when number of such dags was growing. Then I started to persist id of currently active cluster. Before submitting a step I was describing the cluster and making sure it is still running. This reduced number of throttling exceptions but still there were some. Then I introduced exception handling and [exponential back off ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27438273/exponential-backoff-time-sleep-with-random-randint0-1000-1000). This final step eliminated throttling issue. Also does your implementation take care of listing cluster with pagination?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574622784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/574628371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7173#issuecomment-574628371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7173","id":574628371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDYyODM3MQ==","user":{"login":"TobKed","id":32594847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTk0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32594847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed","html_url":"https://github.com/TobKed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T11:57:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T11:57:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kaxil I agree with you. Deprecated parameters can still be used, nothing is changed here.
