Delete the Project\r\nPremise: Ordinary user, create project, create workflow and save\r\nNormal operation: Normal user or administrator user, enter \"Project\", delete the project operation, prompt \"please delete the process definitions in project first! \"\r\nExtreme operation: Use the administrator account, enter \"Security -> User Manage\", delete the ordinary user, prompt \"Seccess\". The following phenomena may occur:\r\n1. Super administrator account, enter project management page, and the project created by the deleted user does not exist.\r\n2. In the Mysql database, in the t_escheduler_project table, the deleted project created by the user exists.\r\n3. Enter the project management page with any account, create the project with the same name as the deleted project, and create it successfully.\r\n4. Super administrator account, enter \"Security -> User Manage\", when authorizing the project for the user, it will show the project that does not exist in the project management page but exists in the Mysql table\r\n\r\n\r\n(2). Delete the User\r\nPremise: delete the user and the following problems will occur:\r\n1.All resources created by the deleted user will still be in the HDFS platform and Mysql table, and all resources of the user cannot be used through the UI.\r\n2.Project created by deleted  users will also be removed, the administrator account to check the project management will find the project which created the user does not exist, but in Mysql table  the project still exist.\r\n\tIf the project had been empowerment to others before delete user action, the deleted items will still be shown in \"Security -> User Manage -> Grant authority -> Project \"\r\n\r\nThe following is the self-test recovery operation:\r\nStep 1: use the administrator account to enter the \"Resources\" and delete all resources belonging to the deleted user\r\nStep 2: delete the resources created by the user on the HDFS platform (if the user has a tenant migration operation, delete the files belonging to the user under the old tenant)\r\nStep 3: if the deleted user has created an item, delete the data corresponding to the user in the Mysql table t_escheduler_project (the project record created by the user).\r\nStep 4: if the deleted user has created a project, then cancel the assignment of other users belonging to the project created by the user (or delete Mysql table t_escheduler_relation_project_user related data).\r\nStep 5: if the deleted user has created a datasource, the datasource will be unavailable, and the prompt \"resource not exist\" will be prompted. Delete the data corresponding to the user in the Mysql table t_escheduler_datasource (the record of the datasource created by the user).\r\nStep 6: If the deleted user has an item that is authorized, and in the item that is authorized, a workflow definition has been created. It will appear that, the workflow definition created by the deleted user will be unavailable. It is necessary to change the Mysql table \"t_escheduler_process_definition\". The \"user_id\" of the related workflow is the user ID or administrator user ID that has permissions for the

Resources\r\n(1) I personally think that there is no need to involve the tenant. \r\nI don't agree with the design that the user tenant will copy the files to the directory of the new tenant, which will cause file redundancy(From the results of testing on HDFS, other file centers have not tested).\r\n(2) Enter \"Resources-> FIle Manage\"\r\nSuggest change \"Name and FileName\" to \"FileName, MD5Name (FileName+owner+createtime to unique identifier), Owner, LastModifyUser\".\r\nThe FileName of the same user cannot be duplicated, and the HDFS storage file name is MD5Name. The files are placed in one directory.\r\nFile permissions can be designed to make the files visible to team members in the project or to themselves\r\n\r\n3. Project \r\nThe project created by the administrator, the administrator has the highest authority of the project.\r\nOrdinary users can only in the project development for workflow\r\n\r\n4. Process definitions\r\nThe user of the workflow is recommended to bind to the project ID, not the user. \r\nIf the user is deleted, the workflow invalidation is an unreasonable

跨项目依赖在1.2.0中已经实现了\r\n\r\n好的，这个是目前遇到的最大的问题，还有很多地方最好能微调下，我有很多使用过程中的建议，如果能采纳，那这将会是一个了不起的项目。\r\n例如：\r\n1.分页查看，每页固定10条，我觉得很不合理，至少要留给用户一个可选的条数。\r\n2.批量上线下线的问题\r\n3.用户创建shell任务的界面，右边弹出的框太小了，我的shell经常会写的很长，要拖到最下面才有进度条来查看后面的内容。你至少要留给我很大空间能够让我看到我的命令，或者就放弃这种右边弹框的方式，直接正中央弹出，并且这个弹框是可以随意移动，可以伸缩大小的，这样就不要纠结shell长度的问题。\r\n4.创建shell任务界面的时候，所有东西都填好了，不小心在左边空白处，点了下鼠标，弹框就缩回去了，然后我填的很多东西都没有了，我很气知道么，好多次就是这样，我填了一大堆，然后就没了，我觉得应该给用户一个关闭当前弹框的按钮，而不是不小心点击了空白界面就什么都没有了。\r\n5.还是shell创建页面，如果我填了很多东西，突然我想放弃这次任务，我点击了chrome左上角的后退按钮，返回到了“工作流定义”界面，这个时候弹框还会存在，我觉得这是个界面BUG。\r\n6.设置定时任务点击“执行时间”按钮，会导致API使用内存不释放，导致闪退，只能重启服务，这个问题可能会修复。\r\n7.建立Dependent任务时，我的任务名字会很长，回显shell名称那里，太长的任务名字显示不了，找不到哪个是我想要的，只能输入名字精确搜索，这里应该要优化一下，至少让用户能完整的看到任务名称，或者把鼠标移上去，能显示完整的名称。\r\n8.我觉得建立子任务名称，不应该叫节点名称，让人很容易想成是物理机节点名称，一个Job下由多个Task组成工作流,而那里应该改为TaskName(任务名称),而不是NodeName(节点名称)。\r\n9.应该让管理员控制每个账户有哪些可选的work工作组，我们之前发生了一件事，就是本来在大数据平台的建表任务，阴差阳错跑到TiDB上建表了，首先能确定你是在什么平台跑数据的，然后只授权一个默认的work工作组，，如果需要连接多个地方，在授权这个账户多个work工作组。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/558542423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/558899342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/756#issuecomment-558899342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/756","id":558899342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODg5OTM0Mg==","user":{"login":"dudiao","id":38355949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzU1OTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38355949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao","html_url":"https://github.com/dudiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dudiao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T02:23:27Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T02:23:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"这个是指元数据存放的数据库吗？我看现在是MySQL，支持其他的数据库都是有哪些啊？现在进度如何","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/558899342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/558908154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/703#issuecomment-558908154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/703","id":558908154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODkwODE1NA==","user":{"login":"francis-du","id":25944814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTQ0ODE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25944814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du","html_url":"https://github.com/francis-du","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francis-du/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T03:08:17Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T03:08:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@dailidong

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n> \r\n> 我们现在大部分的任务使用的是Flink实时计算，在一个工作流中，任务间没有顺序依赖\r\n> \r\n> Most of our current tasks use Flink real-time calculations. In a workflow, there is no order dependency between tasks.\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32353326/69849552-06778500-12b8-11ea-98c8-260537a52a0e.png)\r\n> \r\n> 像图中展示的这样，在当前系统中，箭头代表任务执行的先后顺序，由于我们是实时计算，任务间是并行运行的关系，箭头仅仅代表数据流转方向，并不代表任务执行顺序。所以我们现在，在执行工作流时，会把箭头去除，让所有任务并行执行。\r\n> \r\n> As shown in the figure, in the current system, the arrows represent the order of task execution. Since we are calculating in real time and the tasks are running in parallel, the arrows only represent the direction of data flow and do not represent the task execution order.\r\n> So we now remove the arrow when executing the workflow and let all tasks execute in parallel.\r\n> \r\n> 但是，当前系统的异常通知，如果设置为失败继续，那么某一个任务的失败并不会发送通知。如果设置为失败停止，那么某一个任务的失败会导致整个工作流实例的停止。这并不是我们想要的。\r\n> \r\n> However, if the abnormal notification of the current system is set to continue to fail, a notification of the failure of a task will not be sent.\r\n> If set to fail stop, the failure of one task will cause the entire workflow instance to stop.\r\n> This is not what we want.\r\n> \r\n> **Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n> 1、我们期望可以管理的更加细致。某一个任务的停止，异常，恢复，通知都是独立的。而不是会影响整个工作流。\r\n> \r\n> We want to be able to manage it in more detail.\r\n> The stop, exception, resume and notification of tasks are independent.\r\n> Rather than affecting the entire workflow.\r\n> \r\n> 2、希望可以增加数据流转方向的连线。连线只是为了标识数据流转方向，而不是任务执行顺序\r\n> \r\n> It is hoped that the connection of the data flow direction can be increased.\r\n> The wiring is only to identify the direction of data flow, not the task execution order\r\n> \r\n> **Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n> \r\n> 目前我们只能把每一个任务放在单独的工作流中，也就是一个工作流实例中只有一个任务\r\n> \r\n> **Additional context**\r\n\r\n个人拙见:\r\nFlink实时计算任务，我们已经部署运行线上任务，任务之间不应该存在依赖关系，因为流计算是7*24*365天运行的。不存在所谓的上下游，真实意义的上下游只是MQ中的数据而已。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/560088667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/560113443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1369#issuecomment-560113443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1369","id":560113443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDExMzQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"davidzollo","id":15833811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMzODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15833811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo","html_url":"https://github.com/davidzollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T14:16:05Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T15:24:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"very good idea, I will update the doc tomorrow!

Flink实时计算任务，我们已经部署运行线上任务，任务之间不应该存在依赖关系，因为流计算是7_24_365天运行的。不存在所谓的上下游，真实意义的上下游只是MQ中的数据而已。\r\n\r\n是的 我同意你说的 上下游只是MQ中的数据 所以希望可以有一个数据流转方向的连接线 这样可以清晰的看到数据的走向。可以加VX 聊一下吗？ 可以的话请加我
