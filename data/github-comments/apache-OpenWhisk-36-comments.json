In some deployments we can't hold the request open up to action timeout anyway without keep-alive since there may be overriding settings out of our control. Lastly blocking is for request/response.

'extra complexity': in a traditional http env, you make a request, and wait for the response. the main cases are...it either succeeds (200), fails (50x) or times out. in any case, i can assume nothing keeps running in the background which might provide an update to the status i received as part of the response.\n\nwith the 202 behavior around blocking activations, i can't make that assumption. i have to use the activation id, go back to the server side and keep on polling to see if there is a status change (i might have to poll as 'forever' as waiting for a response for a blocking call). i as a developer implementing a client could equally decide to not use a blocking call at all -- instead, i could use non-blocking calls from the beginning and only do polling...which would be less code than having to handle both the response of a blocking call and doing polling.\n\nthe fact that we're doing polling today in code we wrote is imho not such a good argument, since that's coding complexity we took on our shoulders vs putting it on the shoulders of devs using openwhisk.\n\nso yes...polling is not that hard, but it is additional coding effort for the dev, defeating to some degree the value prop of a blocking call, due to the increased amount of client-side logic.\n\ni also don't have a perfect solution for how to solve this, so trying to lay out the problem stmt here so we can brainstorm on options to address this in the best possible way.\n\nhappy to be corrected. am i missing
