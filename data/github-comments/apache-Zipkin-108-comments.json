Indeed, searching for this returns nothing. \r\n\r\nPaging @adriancole then if this should remain open then or not. It's a bit counterintuitive I guess to want to search this way, but i agree if you have uniquely identifying tags (message ids for example) and a large volume of traces and you want to search for an occurence where message X was handled in the beginning and later on message Y in the same trace, it would be surprising not to find it.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"traceId\":
