I think the approach is in a good direction. (thinking outloud below)\n\nI'm a bit cautious about the `as(Class<T> clazz)` usage in Segment. Somewhere there needs to be a wiring up from the data in storage to the proper objects for extracting that data. `DataSegment` seems to be the current and proposed descriptor for what data exists. And `QueryableIndex` and `StorageAdapter` for expressing the data.\n\n`QueryableIndex` focuses on making Columns, and `StorageAdapter` focuses on making row cursors.\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, the `as` method effectively finds a factory for the class requested, and calls the factory to create the data expression object (QueryableIndex or StorageAdapter).\n\nThe `getSegment` call effectively allows `ServerManager` and others to do some preliminary work on segments by wiring up the mmap stuff, and possibly doing some early validation if needed.\n\nWhat I'm cautious about is that having `as(Class<T> clazz)` does not free up expressions of data in the way that it looks. This change would effectively make the storage mechanism pluggable (as per the issue title) but doesn't allow for a different range of data expressions compared to what exists now. Specifically, if a target for the `as(Class<T> clazz)` does not appear in the same classloader as io.druid.cli.Main or in the same classloader as the extension with the Segment storage impl, then it cannot be used.\n\nAs such, I suggest leaving the two\n\n``` java\n  QueryableIndex asQueryableIndex();\n  StorageAdapter asStorageAdapter();\n```\n\nfor now, until use cases for more dynamic data expression can be more fleshed out.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/219131954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/219140699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2117#issuecomment-219140699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2117","id":219140699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTE0MDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T19:41:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T19:41:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"reopening, @acslk saw this on master recently.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/219140699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/219142323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2117#issuecomment-219142323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2117","id":219142323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTE0MjMyMw==","user":{"login":"acslk","id":11131839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMxODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11131839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk","html_url":"https://github.com/acslk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acslk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T19:49:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T19:49:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis failed this test on Java 8, but not Java 7.
