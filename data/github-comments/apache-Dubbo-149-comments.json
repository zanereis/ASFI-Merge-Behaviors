从调用过程上看这个效果是一样的。但是从使用上来说，dubbo-proxy还是需要先部署http接口然后通过postman来调用，整个过程比之dubbo-postman更繁琐，并且这些操作的接口都是不能集中维护和动态更新的。\r\n我建议可以从使用了两个工具的对比后，可以更直接的感受到这个的差异。\r\n可以这样来对比吧，我觉得可以把dubbo-proxy看作是dubbo-postman产品里面使用的一个具体实现功能。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/606993513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/606996966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5953#issuecomment-606996966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5953","id":606996966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjk5Njk2Ng==","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-01T02:51:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T02:51:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just
