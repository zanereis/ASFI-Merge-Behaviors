I like that you can show arbitrary dialogs without the need to keep them in the component tree prematurely.\r\nI'm not a big fan of the ModalMgr interface and other details though, but these might stem from the fact ModalX uses the old clumsy ModalWindow in the first place. And I don't think imposing any superclass or interface on pages is a bad idea, since Wicket pages have to much responsibility anyway.\r\nI've seen many projects doing the same with their own implementation that keeps central 'pool' of dialogs somewhere in the component hierarchy. How this pool is managed has to be decided by each project individually.\r\n\r\nNote how the example ModalDialogPage uses the new AjaxListPanel to do something similar but more generally:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/a1a6206c30c1f388ec9c3ec32139addb8979c768/wicket-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/examples/ajax/builtin/modal/ModalDialogPage.java#L188\r\n\r\nIMHO this serves the same purpose. Please share your thoughts on what might still be missing or could be improved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/569816088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/570616496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/375#issuecomment-570616496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/375","id":570616496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDYxNjQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"svenmeier","id":543253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/svenmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T16:06:51Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T16:06:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks,

I didn't remove the changes for WICKET-6527, only a very small part of it, namely the customizable classname. In WICKET-6527, the user requests that the styling of the hidden fields is customizable. As the inline styling is now gone and the fields are styled via a classname selector, this is now very easy. In fact, the user can replace the whole core stylesheet. I see no need to keep the classname customizable.\n\nOther customizable classnames serve a different need. Those classes are meant to be matched in user stylesheets. In those cases it is desirable to have them match other classnames in the application. This class had predefined styling, which must not conflict with user styling, hence the `wicket--` prefix. When the user wants to change the styling, he can match the wicket class with `div.wicket--hidden-fields` to make it more specific or replace the entire core stylesheet. Both solutions do not require changing the classname.\n\nI can introduce a second class, as suggested by @solomax, but I would like to see a valid use case first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/577531197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/577582507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/399#issuecomment-577582507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/399","id":577582507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzU4MjUwNw==","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T08:44:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T08:44:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@martin-g

It must be separate from the blocking header, because you need to be able to specify different policies for both. This can be used to test a more strict policy while the old policy is still in effect.\n\nIt is not very useful to share the rules between the 2 headers, because the blocking header can have a reporting directive as well. Perhaps the documentation on these methods can be improved?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/581061980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/581088761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/399#issuecomment-581088761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/399","id":581088761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTA4ODc2MQ==","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T01:52:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T01:52:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@papegaaij the main problem: `reportong` method was the only **configured one**, but surprisingly response contains both `blocking` and `reporting`\r\nif this is by design - rules should be shared (IMO)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/581088761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/581106224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/399#issuecomment-581106224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/399","id":581106224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTEwNjIyNA==","user":{"login":"papegaaij","id":191540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTU0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/191540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij","html_url":"https://github.com/papegaaij","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/papegaaij/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T07:12:41Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T07:12:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@solomax this is because the blocking header is already configured in`WebApplication`.
