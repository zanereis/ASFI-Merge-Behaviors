This means,\nthat the Java license is acceptable to Apache policy.\nUntil September 2018, JavaFX is still part of Java. Then it becomes OpenJFX\n<http://jdk.java.net/openjfx/> with the GNU General Public License, version\n2, with the Classpath Exception\n<http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html>.\n\nWhy the same license is acceptable from Apache for one product (Java) and\nnot acceptable to another (OpenJFX)?\n\nI started using Java 20 years ago in 1998. The Java world has been waiting\nfor JavaFX for over 20 years. Swing and AWT were a failure for Java and\nDesktop applications in the Java world. This was one of the serious\nreasons, Microsoft .NET to overtake Java in many ways.\n\nWhy repeat the same mistake so many times?\n\n\nMiro.\n\nOn Mon, Aug 13, 2018 at 7:31 PM, Matthias Bläsing <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> As a general comment: Swing can be used for GUI because you can expect an\n> installed JDK to carry it. We can't currently depend on OpenJFX, as\n> GPL-v2-CPE is not whitelisted by the apache foundation. There are\n> discussions whether or not it should be usable, but at this time, JavaFX as\n> a core dependency must be considered off-limits.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/pull/672#issuecomment-412580318>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABxbvy0PQw7Q-9AbxhdeHRPoaGkxUpFaks5uQan4gaJpZM4V6VPn>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/413078754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/413079884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/672#issuecomment-413079884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/672","id":413079884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzA3OTg4NA==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-15T03:00:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T03:00:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mnachev As @geertjanw wrote above, please discuss your issue on other places.
