At a high level, I believe there is agreement that we need to 1) reduce bounds checking to (preferably) once per write, and 2) to minimise the number of function calls before memory is actually written to.\r\n\r\nWe have three layers where we could potentially check bounds - i) the operators, ii) the vectors, iii) DrillBuf. Right now, we do so at each level, at multiple times at that. Paul's work on batch sizing provides us with a layer that gives us the bounds check guarantees at the operator level. This means we could potentially use value-vectors' set methods (as opposed to the setSafe methods) and DrillBuf can use PlatformDependent directly. \r\n\r\nSome caveats - \r\nUDLE's check for and enforce little-endianness. Checking for endianness is important for value vectors because they assume little endian,  but the enforcement is sometimes not so desirable. Drill's Java client uses the same DrillBuf backed by a UDLE and that means that client applications can no longer run on big endian machines (and yes, I have heard this request from end users). However, the fact is that UDLE's are an intrinsic part of the drill-memory design [1] [2]. Eliminating UDLE's can lead to re-doing large parts of very well tested code.\r\n\r\nThe caveat to using the vector set methods is that the setSafe methods provide resizing capability that operators have come to rely upon. Switching from setSafe to set breaks practically every operator. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]

DrillBuf is the only memory-level abstraction that (low level) Drill code should reference. The UDLE and other bits should be fully encapsulated. This guideline lets us evolve the representation if we ever need to do so.\r\n\r\nThe original design appeared to be that value vectors would be the primary interface to memory. But, a great many issues made that difficult, not least of which is that vector access methods are heavily typed, resulting in far too much casting. Also, the mutator methods try to do the full operation, leading to inefficiency (especially around VarChars).\r\n\r\nA more general rule is that application code should work with vectors until they can migrate to working with the result set loader or reader. (We should probably call these the row set emitter and collector to be more Hadoop-like...) The higher-level abstractions handle the grunt work currently spread throughout operators.\r\n\r\n(And, to answer a prior question: we want to use the row set abstractions so we have a uniform way to write to vectors, to control batch size, to handle schema issues and so on on write. And, to have a standard way to handle indirection vectors and vector navigation on read.)\r\n\r\nIdeally only, the vector mutator or row set loader implementation works with DrillBuf to do actual data reads and writes. In an early version, the row set loader code used `PlatformDependent` to avoid bounds checks. But, with @vrozov's improvements, doing so became unnecessary -- a nice improvement.\r\n\r\nStill, bounds checks should be done during tests: it is handy to work with a safety net.\r\n\r\nSince bounds checks are optional (turned off in production), then the changes here make good sense: no code should count on bounds checks from the \"unchecked\" methods for the simple reason that the checks are normally off.\r\n\r\nThat said, if there is a reason to have \"checked\" access, we could provide such methods. Those methods would throw the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.  That is, the checked methods would recreate the original \"get/set\" methods prior to @vrozov's improvements. I can't think of a reason to do that off the top of my head, but someone might present a valid use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/378473671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/378702125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1199#issuecomment-378702125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1199","id":378702125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODcwMjEyNQ==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T18:37:14Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T18:37:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva \r\n\r\nI've added 2 snapshots and tested in Chrome.\r\n\r\n**Mouse Over**, showing tooltip\r\n![mouseover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4335237/38327176-74ac0aac-37fc-11e8-9a0e-d5b5ad638460.png)\r\n\r\n**On clicking**, the copy of the text to the clipboard, followed by the alert.\r\n![mouseonclick](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4335237/38327185-79c0377a-37fc-11e8-955f-5dd9ad7bfaea.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/378702125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/378747001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1199#issuecomment-378747001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1199","id":378747001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODc0NzAwMQ==","user":{"login":"priteshm","id":1015719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1015719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm","html_url":"https://github.com/priteshm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T21:13:01Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T21:13:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Nice work, @kkhatua!

But, from what @dvjyothsna explained, it seems that this was the result of a technical hurdle with HTTP**S** protocol. My understanding was that issuing shutdown to secure remote nodes won't work because of lack of certificates for those nodes, making it difficult for the remote Drillbit to authenticate the shutdown command. Keeping that in mind, the SHUTDOWN buttons would appear only for unsecured  Drillbits, i.e. when Authentication is **_not_** enabled.\r\nhttps://github.com/kkhatua/drill/blob/12480507232a91f7bf6e9a045b351cb50e794c67/exec/java-exec/src/main/resources/rest/index.ftl#L100\r\nFor setups requiring Authentication, the shutdown button would not appear.\r\n(PS.
