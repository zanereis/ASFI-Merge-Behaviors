s1) >= level_size (s1) 时，candidate_rowsets直接赋值给input_rowsets，退出。\r\n- 当level_size (s_total - s1) < level_size (s1)  时，candidate_rowsets去掉第一个版本后，回到第一步，循环该流程。\r\n\r\n### 2.2.3 检查input_rowsets，(与原流程一致)\r\n- 当input_rowsets的compaction_score小于最小分数5时，input_rowsets清空，不合并。\r\n- 检查input_rowsets为空时，按时间补充检查，大于1天未执行合并，并且candidate_rowsets中有overlap类型的rowset时，candidate_rowsets直接赋值给input_rowsets，退出。\r\n\r\n### 2.3 执行合并\r\n### 2.4 Cumulative Point更新(调整部分)\r\n新产生rowset的磁盘空间大于base版本rowset的2%或者大于等于2G时，Cumulative Point向前移动，否则不移动。\r\n\r\n### 合并效果评估\r\n### 1 配置参考\r\nsmallest_compaction_limit: 64m\r\nmin_base_compaction_promotion_size: 2G\r\nbase_compaction_delta_ratio: (2%)\r\n\r\n### 2 文件增长情况\r\n根据算法流程的描述，在最坏情况下，经过Cumulative Compaction各个文件都达到临界值没有合并的情况是log2的对数个文件。如下表所示\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67053339/88304370-bfed0400-cd3a-11ea-840d-1b9d66042a75.png)\r\n\r\n### 3 前后对比\r\n这里包括了base compaction和cumulative compaction。假设每次导入文件大小为d，经过q轮导入后执行一次cumulative compaction，经过k次cumulative compaction后执行一次base compaction。共执行n次d的导入。这里假设k大于4\r\n\r\nBase IO 写放大情况可以理解成在n次导入的过程中，Base Compaction执行次数。 因为每次的Base Compaction都要对Base进行完全重新写入一次。通过比较Base Compaction次数可明显看出写放大的情况。\r\n\r\n### 3.1 之前流程\r\n最大存在文件数量 = k + q，\t\t\t// k具有不确定性\r\nBase Compaction次数 p = n / (k * q)\r\nBase IO写入数据量 = d * q * k * p * (p + 1) / 2 = d * n * (n + k* q) / k * q  \r\nCumulative IO写入数据量 = d*n\r\n\r\n### 3.2 改后流程\r\n### 3.2.1 文件数量是相同的，不用分情况讨论：\r\nq * d > 2G时：\r\n最大存在文件数量 = k + 6\r\nq * d < 2G时：\r\n最大存在文件数量 = k * q * d / 2G + 6  \r\n可以避免太多小批量导致的文件数过多\r\n\r\n### 3.2.2 Base IO写入放大情况：\r\na)\t当d * q * k >= 8G时：\r\n\r\n       Base Compaction次数 p = n / (k * q)\r\n       同时，可计算出 Base IO 写入的数据量 =  d * q * k * p * (p + 1) / 2 = d * n * (n + k * q) / k * q\r\n\r\n这种情况下，Base Compaction IO与之前的Base Compaction IO情况整体基本相同，\r\n\r\nb)\t当d * q * k < 8G：\r\n\r\n       Base Compaction次数 p = log(1 + 8%)(n) ，这里不依赖于次数k\r\n       Base IO 写入数据量 = d(1-n/1.08) / (1-1.08) = 18.51 * n * d – 20d\r\n这种情况下，Base Compaction IO会有明显减少，\r\n\r\n### 3.2.3 Cumulative IO写入放大情况：\r\nq*d > 2G时：\r\n\t\r\n           Cumulative IO写入数据量 = n * d\r\n\r\nq*d < 2G时：\r\n\t\r\n           Cumulative IO写入数据量 =（log（2G / q * d）+ 1）* n * d\r\n\r\n### 3.4 整体结论：\r\n在 q * d < 2G时，Cumulative IO牺牲了log（2G / q * d）次的写放大，缩减了k - k * q * d / 2G个文件数。\r\n在 k * q * d <= 8G时，Base IO大量减少了写放大。\r\n在 q * d > 2G时，与之前效果一样。 \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/663071982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/663098881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/4113#issuecomment-663098881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4113","id":663098881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzA5ODg4MQ==","user":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T16:16:44Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T16:16:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhangchangwei ok","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/663098881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/663100986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/4120#issuecomment-663100986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4120","id":663100986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzEwMDk4Ng==","user":{"login":"francisoliverlee","id":5908412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5908412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee","html_url":"https://github.com/francisoliverlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francisoliverlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-23T16:20:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T16:20:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@chaoyli i have checked the query log, query profile is so long that can not be read easily. tool analysis is better.

Changing the current data model to \"Copy-on-Write\" is a very costly thing. Having you any idea about it?\r\n\r\nWe can do it by add delete flag for old rows when doing delete operation.\r\n\r\n> Actually, I think the value column can be filled by some dummy placeholder values. And user can also specify the column mappings in `columns` properties to specified the key columns, and the missing value columns can either will filled by default value automatically, or filled by user manually.\r\n\r\nNow, in one Load job, there are inserted rows and deleted rows, columns mapping works for all of them. Which means loaded rows and delete rows should have the same number of columns.\r\n \r\n> Oh, I forgot, uniq key is also a kind of aggr key model, so this can be performed on aggr key model in some scenarios. It is just like `DELETE FROM` method that system will check if all key columns exists in rollups or materialized views.\r\n\r\nBecause all columns should be given in Load, actually all the delete will be disabled for aggregate model.\r\n\r\n> Duplicate key model is not within our consideration. Cause we do not found a good way to handle this model.\r\n> First of all, the main purpose of this delete function is to receive the data changes of the TP system captured by the CDC system. The data in the TP system usually has the concept of a primary key. And many CDC systems or data transmission systems themselves also require data to have a primary key, otherwise effective incremental data capture cannot be performed. In my opinion, duplicate key is not a data model for strict CRUD scenarios.\r\n\r\nActually, when you create a MySQL table, there is no primary key. And primary key is just a constraint, it is OK to delete/update rows for a table without primary key.\r\n\r\nAnd what's more, if we support this scheme for deletion, how can we support standard SQL delete syntax.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/666958042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/666959279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/4226#issuecomment-666959279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4226","id":666959279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Njk1OTI3OQ==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T06:45:12Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T06:45:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
