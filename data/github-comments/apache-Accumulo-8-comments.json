The problem I am having is\nsimulating console input to the readPassword called by JCommander in the\nChangeSecret tool.  I can run the class using the exec in\nMiniAccumuloClusterImpl but it will hang waiting for input from the\nconsole. I have tried to grab outputstream from the process and write the\npasswords to it. Since readPassword is looking for System.in, I also tried\nsetting the passwords in an InputStream through System.setIn().\n\nThe closest I have come to a successful test is by creating a separate\nthread that constantly writes the password to the OutputStream of the\nChangeSecret process. This won't allow me to change the password though\nsince it will be the same thing for both prompts.  I have no way of knowing\nif its asking for the old or new password. I tried looking at the\nInputStream for which password prompt to determine the correct password but\nreadLine will also block waiting for the password input.\n\nThe ShellServerIT gets around this problem by not calling readLine and just\nexecuting all the commands on the Shell separately.\n\nAnother problem I have is that the ChangeSecret tool requires that\nZookeeper be running and not Accumulo, which there is currently no way of\ndoing with the MAC.\n\nOn Mon, Jul 18, 2016 at 10:36 AM, Josh Elser notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Changes look fine.

IMO using these names will make the code users write shorter and less redundant w/o any loss in readability.  \n\nI would suggest making the builder class package private and adding a `newBuilder()` method to Key that returns the first interface.\n\nBelow is an example of code using all of these suggestions.\n\n``` java\n    byte r[];\n    String f;\n    Text q;\n\n    Key k = Key.newBuilder().row(r).family(f).qualifier(q).build();\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/244126176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/244189467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/145#issuecomment-244189467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/145","id":244189467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDE4OTQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"melrief","id":1481478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODE0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief","html_url":"https://github.com/melrief","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melrief/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T19:41:53Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T19:41:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner Ok I'll add the possibility to use different data types.

The issue on doing this is that `row` cannot be final in the `KeyBuilder` anymore and must default to `null` when the `KeyBuilder` is built, which means that I have another `null` around for a value that cannot be `null` and must be set. That's why I prefer to combine passing the `row` and build the builder together, so I can use the constructor of the builder to set the `row` asap and skip a `null` that eventually must be not `null`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/244189467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/244199276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/145#issuecomment-244199276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/145","id":244199276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDE5OTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T20:18:42Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T20:18:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I have to disagree in removing the column from the column components.

There are definitely two classes of users to consider, new users and experienced users.  I am thinking about making the code pleasant to read and write for more experienced users and you want to make the code easier to read/write for new users.   They are both valid concerns.  Do you think having shorter names and good javadocs on the methods would be good enough for both users?\n\n> I don't understand why the newBuilder() method. What problem does it solve?\n\nNot much.  It offers the following advantages :\n- One less class in public API.   The interfaces need to be in public API, but with this static method the class implementing the interfaces can be package private.\n- When a developer is looking at the Key class methods in an IDE, it makes it easy to discover that a builder exists.  This could also be accomplished with good javadoc for Key that points to the Builder. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/244199276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/244202708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/145#issuecomment-244202708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/145","id":244202708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDIwMjcwOA==","user":{"login":"dhutchis","id":1687158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODcxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis","html_url":"https://github.com/dhutchis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhutchis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T20:31:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T20:31:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The `Key.newBuilder()` also mirrors common practice in Guava and other libraries, that developers may be more familiar with.
