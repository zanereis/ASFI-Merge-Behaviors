That viz could also look good on its own, as well as be used as input for other slices\r\n* can we break down the data driven annotations to a different PR?\r\n* I'm all for formula, vertical, and point markers, though I think we need a bit of a plan as to how all of these annotations come together. The Popover you have here is a very good starting point for this. I'd like to see the Popover have a dropdown for the type marker first, and then alter the form to only show the relevant options in that context.\r\n* for the data-driven annotations, there are considerations around whether they are fetched independently asynchronously or whether they become part of the existing data payload. If async, things get more complex on the visualization interface, having to deal with promise and such. Sounds like in many cases we can't render the markers until the actual data has landed.\r\n* to make all of this comprehensive, we'll need a s-ton of tooltips and some nice docs, this can come later as we settle on the design\r\n\r\n@williaster had some thoughts and said something about providing mocks for the \"Annotations and Markers\" control section and popover","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/332582306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/332583029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3518#issuecomment-332583029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3518","id":332583029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjU4MzAyOQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-27T16:43:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T16:43:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW, I'm excited we got the ball rolling on all this and grateful for all the work that you're doing @fabianmenges.

This would result in deleting a whole bunch of code and make some of the architecture look pretty useless. \r\n\r\n>I'm all for formula, vertical, and point markers, though I think we need a bit of a plan as to how all of these annotations come together...\r\n\r\nI'm making the popover dynamic for each Annotation type right now.\r\nIt already is, if you consider that when its a _Formula_ you can enter the formula, but when it is any other type it is a \"Slice Selector.\" For the slice selector you will be able to pass down 'Since' and 'Until', there is even more things we could pass down, e.g. (Filters, Mapping)\r\nThis is also where you could specify a 'Tilte' and 'Description' and 'Link' coloumn  for a dropdown of a list of all columns, but I probably won't be able to get that stuff into this PR.\r\n\r\n> for the data-driven annotations, there are considerations around whether they are fetched... \r\n\r\nFetching them independently, asynchronously and on the client has many advantages. \r\n- We can fetch all annotation layers in parallel (async), I did not see anything in your current python project configuration that would allow me to do this in a reasonable way in python, (e.g. no gevent, etc). I feel very strongly about not doing this synchronously. \r\n- Separation of concerns: Your charts will still load fast even if there is something wrong with your annotations that might be stored on a different system. Even if we would implement this in python asynchronously we would still have to wait for the timeout of each annotation layer before we could return data. \r\n- If AnnotationLayers are hidden and you 'unhide' them you only have to load the missing data and not all the data\r\n\r\n> to make all of this comprehensive, we'll need a s-ton of tooltips\r\n\r\nI can take care of this. Would like to get that into a 2nd PR.\r\n\r\nThis will get deployed to our production environment by Friday. It would be great if we could nail out the architecture questions beforehand. I hate writing JSON migration scripts.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/332604969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/332608169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3534#issuecomment-332608169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3534","id":332608169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjYwODE2OQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-27T18:08:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T18:08:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

It works for me if I do\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport PYTHONPATH=.\r\n./run_tests.sh\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/332767475/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/332769130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3503#issuecomment-332769130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3503","id":332769130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjc2OTEzMA==","user":{"login":"qeorqe","id":15161073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTYxMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15161073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe","html_url":"https://github.com/qeorqe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qeorqe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-28T08:39:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T08:39:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why did you close this item?
