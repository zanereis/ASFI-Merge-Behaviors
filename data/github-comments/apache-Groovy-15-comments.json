some more thought I wonder if this (2.5+) would be the time to start a `org.apache.groovy.vmplugin` or `org.apache.groovy.internal.vmplugin` package and start with a `vm8` package under it establishing it as a new standard naming (i.e., followed soon by `vm9`)?\r\n\r\nIf there's interest in that I'll redo the PR, otherwise will merge this as

think it would be confusing to have the plugins for different vm versions across different packages but I like your idea of doing a bit of a clean up.

Then create an `org.apache.groovy.internal.vmplugin` package as you suggest and bring across a merged Java7 class in the `vm7` package which merges the current v5/v6/v7 classes (later versions taking priority). The `vm8` package would of course reappear in the new package.\r\n\r\nWe'd need to double check that didn't alter anything but I believe should be what we want for 2.5+.

for the PR, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nJust a note, I relocated the newly added `GeneralUtils#cmpX(Expression,Expression,boolean)` method into the `SortableASTTransformation` class as a private helper method.  Given its limited use it didn't seem to warrant exposing it as a public method.  If/when other uses come up then it may make sense to move it back to a public method like `GeneralUtils`, but I think it's always good to err on the side of less visibility whenever possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/315634645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/315636937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/555#issuecomment-315636937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/555","id":315636937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTYzNjkzNw==","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-16T21:01:20Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T21:01:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This
