basically, this is caused by the size of the metrics set is much smaller than the size of the trace dataset. Right? If so, I would like to ask you, consider to enhance `StorageModuleElasticsearchConfig#dayStep`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Since 6.4.0, the index of metrics and traces data in minute/hour/month precision are organized in days. ES\r\n     * storage creates new indexes in every day.\r\n     *\r\n     * @since 7.0.0 dayStep represents how many days a single one index represents. Default is 1, meaning no difference\r\n     * with previous versions. But if there isn't much traffic for single one day, user could set the step larger to\r\n     * reduce the number of indexes, and keep the TTL longer.\r\n     */\r\n    @Getter\r\n    private int dayStep = 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to your case, we should add a new config for `dayStepForRecord`, which default is `-1`, meaning disabled. Then the codes still use `dayStep = 1`.\r\nBut to resolve your issue, you could set `dayStep = 7`(or more) and `dayStepForRecord = 1`, then the number of index(es) and shards decrease clearly. Then the ElasticSearch LB mechanism should be back to work again.\r\n\r\n@EvanLjp If you like this, we should forward this change to the mail list before we change the codes(PR).\r\n\r\nFYI @apache/skywalking-committers WDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/669726512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/669728244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5251#issuecomment-669728244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5251","id":669728244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTcyODI0NA==","user":{"login":"EvanLjp","id":31562192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTYyMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31562192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp","html_url":"https://github.com/EvanLjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T06:23:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T06:23:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wu-sheng it's a good feature.

Probably they will raise their eyebrows. The package declaration in the .proto file is the namespace used by the protobuf language. The recommended name pattern will be something like `package company_name.project_name`. As an example, the well-known types are defined in the `google.protobuf` namespace. The lack of a package declaration means that all declarations in your *.proto file are in the top-level global namespace, which seems very highly prone to namespace conflicts.
