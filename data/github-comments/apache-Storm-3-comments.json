makes them. The same is true for Juju. Who do you think makes the best Hadoop type of charms, the Apache foundation or Canonical? Most Hadoop type of projects are currently hard for people to setup and integrate into other projects. Canonical wants to help people to reduce the setup, integration and scaling to one line commands: juju quickstart bundle, juju add-relation, juju add-unit, etc. Canonical basically has the same goal as the Apache foundation: make it easy for everybody to use great open source solutions. So I would only ask for you to give Juju a quick try and then you will understand that jointly we can make the life of millions of people easier and spread Apache software more widely and more consistently.

Multilang's Metrics feature</p>\n\n<p>    for <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-200\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-200</a></p>\n\n<p>    Storm 0.9.0.1 exposes a metrics interface to report summary statistics across the full topology. We can build our own metric, and build metrics consumer to use those statistics. </p>\n\n<p>    But when we use Multilang(ie. Python), we can not use this feature. So we want to summit a proposal for multilang's metrics. </p>\n\n<p>    The specifics of the proposal: <br/>\n    1. The main idea is: when user want to add a metric statistics in multilang(python) bolt， <br/>\na) he need first create a metric object and register in ShellBolt's sub-class, <br/>\nb) then update the metric in Python bolt process through RPC call. </p>\n\n<p>    2. In Metrics API: <br/>\na) extend IMetric interface add a method for RPC call：<br/>\n       public void updateMetricFromRPC(List<Object> params); <br/>\nb) modify IMetric implements, to support updateMetricFromRPC; </p>\n\n<p>    3. In ShellBolt， <br/>\na) we have a Map<String, IMetric> to hold user's registered metrics object； <br/>\nb) we have a method registerMetric(String name, T metric) for user to register their metrics object; <br/>\nc) we have a method handleMetrics(Map action) to handle RPC call from Python process； </p>\n\n<p>    4) In Multilang protocol: add a command \"metrics\" for shell process to make RPC call. The protocol is: </p>\n{\"command\":\"metrics\", \"name\":\"metric-registerd-name\", \"params\":[\"param-1\", param-2]}\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>    5) In storm.py：add rpcMetrics(name, params), user can update remote metric through this RPC call. </p>\n\n<p>    -------<del>ExamplePythonBolt.java</del>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n

The RELEASE file appears to no longer be used except to check if this is a RELEASE or not when running storm.  Should we just remove it? or at least remove the VERSION stored in it?  Also I am a bit concerned about windows.  Windows support was added recently and it does not look like the new shell script is going to work when building on windows.  Also there is a storm.cmd now for running on windows, instead of the python script.  I think that needs to also be updated with the same changes that went into the python storm script.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612454023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612431556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/3905#issuecomment-2612431556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3905","id":2612431556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0MzE1NTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-25T17:36:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:35:51Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/33#discussion_r10046165\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/33#discussion_r10046165</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/drpc.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -59,6 +63,8 @@<br/>\n (when-let <span class=\"error\">&#91;sem (@id->sem id)&#93;</span><br/>\n   (swap! id->result assoc id (DRPCExecutionException. \"Request timed out\"))<br/>\n   (.release sem))<br/>\n    +      (.remove (acquire-queue request-queues (@id->function id)) (@id->request id))<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    Either your indentation is wrong here or you have put the remove in the incorrect place.

That does something very similar, but for downloading the file instead of uploading it.  My biggest concern with that part though, is if someone tries to download a very large file, say 2+GB to many different nodes it could saturate the network for an extended period of time.

Controlling chunk size seems like a poor substitute for actual rate throttling, but I don't want to cause grief for cluster operations with this patch.

Even 4GB on gigabit Ethernet is only going to take 30 secs to a min, and that is a one time transfer to a single machine.  My bigger concern is with downloading to potentially hundreds of nodes.  If Taylor is going to resurrect the bit-torrent patch, which seems much more like the right solution overall, I don't see a reason to improve code that will go away in the near future.

I did a small hack in core.clj, add a loader page which use javascript to redirect to the right URL:<br/>\n(GET \"/loader\" request (str \"<script>window.location.href='http://\" (:server-name request) \":\" (:server-port request) \"'; </script>\"))<br/>\nAnd then fill the loader page as TrackingURL, so, if the storm ui IP:port can be accessed from your client machine, then it should work.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612454500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612432421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/3912#issuecomment-2612432421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3912","id":2612432421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0MzI0MjE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-27T04:58:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:36:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ptgoetz\">ptgoetz</a>:</i>\n<p>I looked into this a bit, but not too far.</p>\n\n<p>With the curator versions that are compatible with zookeeper 3.4.x, things seemed to have changed a bit.</p>\n\n<p>(Specifically in our unit tests) We make a lot of calls to backtype.storm.utils.Utils.newCurator(), which creates a new (and expensive) <tt>CuratorFrameWork</tt> with every invocation.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Curator documentation <span class=\"error\">&#91;1&#93;</span>, a <tt>CuratorFramework</tt> instance should only be created once for each distinct zookeeper quorum/cluster.

On Linux things are just generally a bit slower.  Not totally sure why, but everything still works.  On Mac, however, there appears to be some sort of a timeout that is happening some of the time when a new curator instance is created.  On my mac about 4 out of 10 new curator instances will have almost exactly a 5 second delay before the curator client's first command can be processed.</p>\n\n<p>This is specifically a ZK issue, because zk-3.3.6 is always very fast, but zk-3.4.0 shows this, while holding everything else the same.
