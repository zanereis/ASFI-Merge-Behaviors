As far as I can see jclouds wants the providers (`rackspace-cloudfiles-uk-1.9.1.jar`, `rackspace-cloudfiles-us-1.9.1.jar`) to be present in the classpath. Except for this thing it works like a charm and it also seem to start more faster than before.\n\nRegarding the additional classpath, may it be an issue for the acceptance of this merge? Do you think that it could be useful to check if `DRUID_CP` is already defined in `run_druid_server.sh`?

So in your case, another way to let Druid load your extension is to add `\"druid-cloudfiles-extensions\"` in `druid.extensions.loadList`(you can modify the value of that property in common.runtime.properties under `druid-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/config/_common`), then at runtime, Druid will look for `druid-cloudfiles-extensions` under extensions directory.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/152755582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/152766934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1895#issuecomment-152766934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1895","id":152766934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mjc2NjkzNA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-31T20:00:25Z","updated_at":"2015-10-31T20:00:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: given that,\n- Single segment announcing provided a transition for folks upgrading from 0.6.x, and we've kept it for a couple major versions but should not keep it forever\n- Bridge nodes / Offheap ingestion / IndexMaker are not documented and I believe nobody uses them\n\nAlso agree we should hold for #1804.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/152766934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/152767039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1892#issuecomment-152767039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1892","id":152767039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mjc2NzAzOQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-31T20:03:11Z","updated_at":"2015-10-31T20:03:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that ideally search should be case sensitive by default.

I took a look at your code. I think the problem comes from the jClouds API you used.\nSpecifically, in this line\n\n``` java\nContextBuilder cb = ContextBuilder.newBuilder(config.getProvider())\n            .credentials(config.getUserName(), config.getApiKey()).modules(modules);\n```\n\nThe `ContextBuilder` will search for `config.getProvider()` from all the registered providers and see if there is a match, and throw `NoSuchElementException` if there isn't. This `all()` method below returns all the registered providers.\n\n``` java\n   /**\n    * Returns all available providers.\n    * \n    * @return all available providers\n    */\n   public static Iterable<ProviderMetadata> all() {\n     return ImmutableSet.<ProviderMetadata>builder()\n                        .addAll(fromServiceLoader())\n                        .addAll(ProviderRegistry.fromRegistry()).build();\n   }\n```\n\nIf you look at the implementation of  `fromServiceLoader()`\n\n``` java\n/**\n    * Returns the providers located on the classpath via {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.\n    * \n    * @return all available providers loaded from classpath via ServiceLoader\n    */\n   public static Iterable<ProviderMetadata> fromServiceLoader() {\n      return ServiceLoader.load(ProviderMetadata.class);\n   }\n```\n\nWhat it does is searching implementations of `ProviderMetadata` through current thread's context classloader, which is essentially the classpath used to run Druid. Since we are using classloader isolation to load this extension, the Druid classpath won't contain any jar related to cloudfiles extension. So `fromServiceLoader()` will return an empty iterable and `ContextBuilder` will eventually throw `NoSuchElementException` in your case.  \n\nFrom looking at the code, I believe there is another way to register Providers, can you try using `ProviderRegistry` to register different implementations of `ProviderMetadata`? You can put something like this before you create the `ContextBuilder`,\n\n```\nProviderRegistry.registerProvider(CloudFilesUSProviderMetadata.builder().build());\nProviderRegistry.registerProvider(CloudFilesUKProviderMetadata.builder().build());\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/153163814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/153171843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1804#issuecomment-153171843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1804","id":153171843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzE3MTg0Mw==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-02T22:05:38Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T22:05:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@himanshug I had marked default bitmap config deprecated mainly because it is possible to specify it in the index spec ever since we added compression, whereas before that property was the only way to specify it.
