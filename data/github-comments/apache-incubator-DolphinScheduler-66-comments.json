It may be that first time the master reads the data on the master , it will be executed, and then the command will be removed from the master, and the second loop will be read from the slave. However, due to the delay of master-slave synchronization, the command in the slave is not deleted, so it is executed again\r\n\r\n---\r\n就是插入command是插入到master了，但是读的时候可能会从master或者slave读，那可能第一次读了master发现有数据就执行了，然后从master中移除command，第二次循环就从slave读了，但是由于主从同步延时，所以这时候slave里面的这条command并没有被删除，所以又执行了一次
