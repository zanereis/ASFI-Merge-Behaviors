href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kabhwan\">kabhwan</a>:</i>\n<p>cleanup-corrupt-topologies! is a legacy code written at very first version of Nimbus so it doesn't consider H/A of nimbus. It assumes that all topology codes should be available at Nimbus startup, but in many cases it doesn't.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show some cases:</p>\n\n<p>1. When we launch nimbus process from new node. The node never has topology code in local dir since this is the first time Nimbus process is launched. So while startup of Nimbus, Nimbus calls cleanup-corrupt-topologies!, and all topologies goes away from ZK.<br/>\n(This is easy to reproduce and occurred during valid use case so IMO this is 'Blocker'.)</p>\n\n<p>2. At a glance, Local BlobStore does full replications to all nimbuses which is same as before.<br/>\nBut when submitting topology, leader Nimbus starts to make assignment when topology.min.replication.count is achieved or it waits longer than topology.max.replication.wait.time.sec. So there's still a gap between topology assignment and full replications. If one or more follower nimbuses are crashed before replicating topology code at that time and restarted, cleanup-corrupt-topologies! removes that topology from ZK.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, I didn't look deeply at the source code, but full replication seems to be started immediately when topology is submitted. I set nimbus.code.sync.freq.secs to 600 to give a delay, but full replication is started while topology code is uploading to leader nimbus. If then this gap may be small in LAN.</p>\n\n<p>N1 (leader)</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">2016-07-17
