I looked at the code, and the only way that they are removed from the response of the list VMs methods is after the expunge thread execution that fills out the “removed” field in the database.\n\nI also looked at the code of the integration tests, my perl is a little rusty, but I noticed that the code waits a few cycles (2) of the expunge delay to execute; therefore, there is no way to guarantee that the expunge thread has already been executed and the VM has passed the expunge delay and has been removed.\n\nIf I recall properly, there are mainly three (3) variables in play, the time that the VM was destroyed, the expunge delay per se and the expunge interval (the interval of the expunge thread execution). \n\nSo, if the expunge thread runs, but the VM has been destroyed too recently and has not passed the expunge delay, it will not be marked as destroyed. That is what seems to have happened there. I know some people may come and say, “the test worked a lot of time”. And yes it can work, but it depends if you are luck or not. I personally do not like tests that may present this kind of behavior.  Moreover, the expunge interval depends on the time that the MS has been started.\n\nI will illustrate it with an example that we have seen happening here.\nGiving that our expunge interval is 24 hours, and our expunge delay is also 24 hours. Suppose the MS server was started and got up and running at some day at 23:59 and that the first time the expunge thread runs is 00:00. If we are unlucky and we destroy the VM at 00:01, next day (second run of the expunge thread) when the thread runs at 00:00, the VM will not be removed and will continue appearing, since the expunge delay that cotrols the VMs removal is 24 hours and the VM has been destroyed for 23:59 (almost there, but not yet). Therefore, the VM will only be removed in the third execution of the expunge thread.\n\nHaving said that, I have the following questions, what do we want with that test? We want to test the expunge thread? Or just test If the destroyed VM is not listed? If we want the second, why don’t we force the expunging (using expungeVirtualMachine command) instead of waiting the expunge thread?\n\nIf the idea is to let the test as it is, to avoid the problem I have just described, we could just change a \"bit\" of the file test_vm_life_cycle the multiplier, in line 632 from “4” to “6” . That change would guarantee to wait till the third execution of the expunge thread, and avoid cases as the one described.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/160966699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/160973087","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1108#issuecomment-160973087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1108","id":160973087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDk3MzA4Nw==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T13:40:02Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T13:40:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@DaanHoogland problem solved with that class.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/160973087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/160978139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1134#issuecomment-160978139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1134","id":160978139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDk3ODEzOQ==","user":{"login":"pdube","id":2355044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTUwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2355044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube","html_url":"https://github.com/pdube","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdube/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T14:03:35Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T14:03:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@resmo @ustcweizhou @remibergsma Any news on testing?
