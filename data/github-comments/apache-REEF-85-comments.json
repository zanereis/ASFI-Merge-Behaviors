An `AllocatedEvaluator` isn't actually running anything, not even `Evaluator.exe`. Hence, this shutdown should be much, much faster. We have a test for this in Java in `org.apache.reef.tests.close_eval.CloseEvaluatorTest` which on my machine runs very fast. Hence, the reason for the slowdown is more likely to be either in the Bridge or the .NET code. However, nothing obvious comes to mind. All that code does is to call `.close()` on the java side. Maybe the bridge assumes a different call order?\r\n\r\nMaybe a next step is to write a test just for this code path?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/318791622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/318794325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1344#issuecomment-318794325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1344","id":318794325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODc5NDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-29T01:27:54Z","updated_at":"2017-07-29T01:27:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I actually don't think it is caused by slow.
