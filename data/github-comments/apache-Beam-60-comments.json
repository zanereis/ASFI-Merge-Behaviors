It was using PipelineOptions as the parser for arguments only used in IT tests main(), such as checksum (which is not a true pipeline option).\n2. It is still using PipelineOptions as the arguments parser for WordCount.main(). All cmd arguments, relevant or irrelevant, are passed to WordCount.\nWordCount.main(TestPipeline.convertToArgs(options))\n\nThose improper uses requires declaring all PipelineOptions in the global namespace through register(), which caused the post-submit failure.\n\nThis PR removed the first improper use, and reduced some utilities (which we are not currently depends on). So, I think it is a good change.\n\nThere is some ideas about support a testArg for ITs tests in here:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-898?focusedCommentId=15648972&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15648972\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/259536872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/259542465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1264#issuecomment-259542465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1264","id":259542465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTU0MjQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T22:16:00Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T22:16:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R: @swegner can you take a look?
