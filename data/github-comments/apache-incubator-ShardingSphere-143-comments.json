If there is no `parsing`, then `rewriting SQL` can not work either. Consequently, users have to write SQL with the actual table name instead of a logic table. That will confuse the user, right?\r\n3.

Why do you think these tests are as expected? You mean your test method is reasonable?\r\n\r\n1. Our bussiness is mostly like selecting one record in one sql. We will do some test like what you recommended  if we need.\r\n2. We have done a group of testcases of sharding-proxy and sharding-jdbc(4.1.0) compare to mysql(5.7.31). Our hardware and software enviroument is  just simulation of our product enviroment , so I am afraid can not be a standard performance to consider.\r\n4. We think this test result is as expected, without sharding any databases or tables, sharding-jdbc's natural performacne overhead is less than 10%, sharding-proxy's natural performance overhead is less than 30%. If the hardware environment including disk and memory configuration is unchanged, the single database  sharding-table can acctually not improve the performance, and the performance bottleneck of our test results eventually falls on the disk I/O. So sharding-databases will be our solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/673988325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/673988802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6839#issuecomment-673988802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6839","id":673988802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Mzk4ODgwMg==","user":{"login":"Lucas-307","id":5524798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQ3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307","html_url":"https://github.com/Lucas-307","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-307/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T09:39:35Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:39:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@whg903 ,From the stack log, I think it's cause by you didn't init h2 database. you should create table \"t_order\" first.\r\n`Caused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLSyntaxErrorException: Table \"t_order\" not found`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/673988802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/673990336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6685#issuecomment-673990336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6685","id":673990336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Mzk5MDMzNg==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T09:43:14Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T09:43:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lishijun121910 \r\nIf you'd like to use connector/J 8.x, please turn to ShardingSphere-Proxy 4.1.1.
