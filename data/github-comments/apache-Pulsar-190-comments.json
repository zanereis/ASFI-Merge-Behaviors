I would like to avoid using it if possible, as we would need to reimplement full functionality of subscriptions but on the client side, as we need an out-of-order acknowledgements as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe explaining the full flow of the system (Apache Flink based) would be useful:\r\n\r\nMessage is read from pulsar and sent asynchronously down the processing pipeline. Given that some messages go down the pipeline faster than others - ordering might be lost. At a point of time, a synchronization signal is sent for all processors to \"checkpoint\" their state changes, similar to a \"commit\" of a transaction. At this moment our reader needs to ack the messages that have reached the end of the processing pipeline (which again, might miss a few late ones).\r\n\r\nEvery \"commit\" that the system has made is in theory restorable. That is, for every other component we can say \"restore your state from 3 commits before now\". Except Pulsar subscriber. In pulsar subscriber the only \"commit\" I can go back is the set of messages that have been acked by sending a `redeliverUnacked` command. \r\n\r\nThat's where this feature request comes in. By copying a subscription we would essentially be able to make a \"snapshot\" of the state of subscription that we would be able to go back later if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks, hope that clarifies the feature request.

However this behavior has been there from v1 to v3. If this \"buggy\" behavior was exposed publicly to the user, that means some existing tools might already rely on this behavior. Changing such an API is breaking the behavior that people saws before. Hence I think a better option is to introduce a newer API to amend this buggy behavior.\r\n\r\nFor any behavior changes, it should be highlighted in a release note. I understand that we used t create release notes when cutting a release. But it has introduced many troubles to the release manager as well as for the users. Because it is hard for a release manager to grab all the changes at the time of cutting a release. Users are frustrated about the breaking changes that are not documented and have complained about the documentation here and there. Hence I would suggest we should adding a place to track breaking changes and behavior during developing a release. Adding a section for an under-developing release in release notes for accumulating breaking changes seems to be a good way to go. Because the release manager can find it when cutting a release and users can find potential breaking changes in the upcoming release.\r\n\r\nI think the conversation here should be brought to the mailing list for a discussion and a potential vote since it is related to behavior change and also release process/document change.

How soon is \"soon\"?\r\n\r\n@sijie any feedback on this?\r\n\r\n> @sky-big regarding a specific design I would design it as explained above but I will see if I can produce a more detailed design specification as a PR.\r\n\r\n@sky-big  sorry for not getting back to you, the pulsar project took a back-seat for while where I work. It is getting reprioritised again so I will start looking into that PR again. Note that I am not talking about code at this point but at least I should be able to put how I think it should work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/581127317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/581128644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5534#issuecomment-581128644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5534","id":581128644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTEyODY0NA==","user":{"login":"sky-big","id":15882125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODgyMTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15882125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big","html_url":"https://github.com/sky-big","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T12:02:08Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T12:02:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chrsoo OK","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/581128644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/581132978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5534#issuecomment-581132978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5534","id":581132978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTEzMjk3OA==","user":{"login":"sky-big","id":15882125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODgyMTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15882125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big","html_url":"https://github.com/sky-big","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sky-big/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T12:57:31Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T12:57:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I created slack https://pulsaroperator.slack.com/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/581132978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/581144257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6185#issuecomment-581144257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6185","id":581144257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTE0NDI1Nw==","user":{"login":"Phat-Loc","id":173334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc","html_url":"https://github.com/Phat-Loc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phat-Loc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T15:05:57Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T15:05:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The multi topic feature does not work as documented.
