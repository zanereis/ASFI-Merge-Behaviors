And I am \"almost\" finish the python implementation. Basically:\n1. configure neural nets\n2. bind those symbols to an executor\n3. self defined iteration and EM update\n   (3.1) E  step: executor.forward and combine some functions, then sampling\n   (3.2) M step: executor.backward and combine some functions, then updating\n\nAre these steps right? However, current python implementation is not efficient enough, considering the python sampler. So my advisor suggested to the cpp implementation, and the sampler could use the \"dmlc/experimental-lda\" (need many changes). So I was wondering if you have cpp examples?

for point it out. Yes. These could be reduced to two possible cases by use it with together reshape. For example, say X is 3 dimension (c, t, h, w), what and we want to swap c and w, what we can do is \n\nSwap that involves the lowest dimension\n\n``` c++\nreshape(swapaxis<0, 2>(reshape(X, (c, t *h, w))), (w, t, h, w))\n```\n\nGeneral swap dim1, dim2\n\n``` c++\nswapaxis<1, 3>(reshape(X, (prod(shape[0:dim1]), dim1, prod(shape[dim1:dim2]), dim2, prod(dim2:end]))\n```\n\nSo you can use get_with_shape function in TBlob, which allows you to convert any TBlob contiguously into 4D Tensor using above rule,m and do swap axis on 1 and 3\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/153569912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/153571980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/479#issuecomment-153571980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/479","id":153571980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzU3MTk4MA==","user":{"login":"winstywang","id":4225664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjU2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4225664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang","html_url":"https://github.com/winstywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T04:49:56Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T04:49:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You

, hmm, this seems a bug ;\nthe reason is that we cannot use \"arg_params=mx.nd.load('lenet_2GPU-0005.params')\" directly, because mx.nd.load() is not just return  arg_params but also return aux_params, so we should seperate the arg_params from the returned dict, and then feed into mx.model.FeedForward(...), can refer to https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/model.py#L425\nacturally, the mx.nd.load() interface is a bit puzzling for users, maybe @tqchen , can add seperate interface, like
