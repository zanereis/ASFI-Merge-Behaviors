it. Is it possible to bind the embedded Kafka to port `0` and then find out which it was assigned? I understand this might be a plumbing pain. I've run the following,\n\n```\nmvn integration-test -Plocal-runnable-on-service-tests -pl runners/spark -am\n```\n\nwhich surfaces a failure in `CombineTest.testSessionsCombineWithContext()`. Is this related to [BEAM-696](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-696)?\n\nTravis is doing its usual ~50% green.\n\nOverall, I prefer having a running test config with a failure to no actual tests running, and it is better for collaboration to get this in, so LGTM. I'll merge it and suggest to roll forwards with any further improvements and fixes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/254921132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/254922560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1055#issuecomment-254922560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1055","id":254922560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDkyMjU2MA==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-19T19:56:03Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T19:56:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Actually, could you rebase and maybe reword the first commit messages, then merge?
