more comment: since it `gobblin.yarn.job.conf.dir` may be used to specify a single job config file, it may make more sense renaming it to `gobblin.yarn.job.conf.path` and add Javadoc explaining what it means, otherwise LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/161410095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/161430615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/492#issuecomment-161430615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/492","id":161430615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTQzMDYxNQ==","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-02T20:52:08Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T20:52:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@liyinan926

I think we should instead take the following approach.\n- New interface called `ModifiableStateStore`, with methods like `modify(String storeName, String tableName, String key, Object newValue)`.\n- Have `FsStateStore` implement this new interface and move all the code in this PR into this new method.\n- Modify the the command line tool changes in this PR to work with `ModifiableStateStore`.\n  - This has the advantage that the command line tool is not tied to any specific State Store implementation. Currently, this PR assumes we are interacting with an `FsStateStore`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/162086675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/162087244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/448#issuecomment-162087244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/448","id":162087244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjA4NzI0NA==","user":{"login":"liyinan926","id":3709137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinan926","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T21:32:12Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T21:32:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed with @sahilTakiar.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/162087244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/162100409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/505#issuecomment-162100409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/505","id":162100409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjEwMDQwOQ==","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T22:32:05Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T22:32:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Weird that this builds fine on my machine, but fails within travis.
