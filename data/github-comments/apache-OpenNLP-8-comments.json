I know we are missing a lot of Javadocs in places. There are probably places to improve the [manual](https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/1.9.2/manual/opennlp.html), too. \r\n\r\nThere are a few tasks listed for wanting contributions at https://opennlp.apache.org/get-involved.html.\r\n\r\nAnd if you haven't already, be sure to join the user and dev mailing lists at https://opennlp.apache.org/mailing-lists.html. When we do a new release it would be helpful if you could help us test it and vote for the release.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your contribution!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/629193726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/629612529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/374#issuecomment-629612529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/374","id":629612529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTYxMjUyOQ==","user":{"login":"jongwoojeff","id":31905260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTA1MjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31905260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff","html_url":"https://github.com/jongwoojeff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongwoojeff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-16T08:57:52Z","updated_at":"2020-05-16T08:57:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jzonthemtn Thanks for the advice!
