These could be reasonably be being used by users, so I think it'd be useful to have these deprecated for a cycle with a call out in the release/upgrade notes. Specifically:\r\n> \r\n>     1. I think it's probably ok to change `isSame()`. It's rather unlikely for a difference to surface.\r\n> \r\n>     2. It'd be good to leave a `@Deprecated` `computeMd5Digest()` for the 1.14 cycle.\r\n> \r\n>     3. I'm torn on `generateAdditionalUrlsFingerprint` since it's intended use is pretty specific and I don't think it's as likely that there are users of it.\r\n> \r\n>     4. I think we can just deprecate `MD5SumMonitor` and add your new `DigestUpdateMonitor`.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Since it's (2) and (4) don't require any work, I think we should leave them around for a bit. The tough one is `generateAdditionalUrlsFingerprint`.\r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughtful feedback @jfrazee!  The points noted raise some good questions about the expectation of compatibility in various NiFi modules.  For instance, `MD5SumMonitor` is used exclusively in unit tests within the code base.  Aside from the usage of `computeMd5Digest()` in the `isSame()` method, the only usage of that method was in tests.  For that method in particular, it seems that it would have been better to mark it as private from the beginning.  Regarding `generateAdditionalUrlsFingerprint()`, the return value is now an SHA-256 digest instead of an MD5 digest, but the concept of computing a unique fingerprint from the provided values is unchanged.  Unfortunately the method was not documented and did not otherwise indicate that an MD5 digest would be returned.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to get some input from additional maintainers, but if all public methods in any class within NiFi should be considered part of the official semantic version, then it seems that more rigor is necessary when creating things like utility classes.  I'm open to marking `computeMd5Digest` as deprecated if absolutely necessary, but would prefer to leave the other changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/779460977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/779475215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4788#issuecomment-779475215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4788","id":779475215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTQ3NTIxNQ==","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-15T22:28:36Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T22:28:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfrazee The [Version Scheme and API Compatibility](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Version+Scheme+and+API+Compatibility) page indicates anything outside of `nifi-api`, aside from the REST API, extension components, and other elements mentioned, is not considered part of the public API:\r\n\r\n> Anything not listed above is not considered part of the API and is subject to change in a manner that may differ from the guidance below.

is a +1 from me. I think that the benefits of moving away from MD5 outweigh potential risks of people using parts of NiFi framework that aren't considered the official API. Hopefully it would also be a small change for them to correct if they are using these specific methods. From what I can tell from the code, comments above, and my own testing, we don't foresee any issues that could arise from the actual change of the hashing function away from MD5.
