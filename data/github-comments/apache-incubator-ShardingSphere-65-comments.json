Some logic of masterSlave was removed in DataSourceMetas. \r\n\r\nIf that can not match, catalog will be null. If catalog will be null then the mysql will find the first datasource to search table,in my mysql,the first datasource is admin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/527011161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/527015677","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2958#issuecomment-527015677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2958","id":527015677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzAxNTY3Nw==","user":{"login":"toby1024","id":1757739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTc3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1757739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024","html_url":"https://github.com/toby1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toby1024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-02T06:12:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T06:12:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> `HintManager` can work with myabtis too.

When an original DataSource is hacked for example to a ShardingDataSource. How to decide the behavior when the method of this DataSource is called? \r\nIf the user call ds.getConnection(), we want the DataSource behaves like a ShardingDataSource. While if the Sharding-JDBC call ds.getConnection(), we want the DataSource behaves like an original DataSource.\r\nIt's convenient that we can find out who currently call getConnection() via Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace(). When the stack trace is from Sharding-JDBC, we treat the DataSource as the original one. \r\n\r\n3. How to support so many DataSources from various connection pools?\r\nWe have to redefine DataSources for some popular connection pools one by one.
