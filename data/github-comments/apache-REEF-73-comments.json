Since master typically does not have data, it enters registration earlier and hence times out if its children are loading a large amount of data. Same thing can happen if cluster is busy and there is some latency in getting all the evaluators, although in this case exponential back off makes more sense

IMRUDriver is almost gone, however, the same code goes to those managers. There is nothing reduced. \n\nAnd it introduced a lot of complexity. \n1. All the managers need to know each other. e.g. in FailedEvaluator, it needs to inform Context manger to remove failed Context in the failed evaluator and Task Manager to record failed task. In Task Manager, it needs to ask Evaluator manager if EvaluatorId in IActiveContext is a master Evaluator. \n2. Since those are handlers, they must be injectable. That's fine. The result is most of the parameters in IMRUDriver constructor are copied to all the three managers. make every constructor complex. \n3. As some of the code needs to use <TMapInput, TMapOutput, TResult, TPartitionType>, it ends up each manager has to be generic with those Ts. Make the code looks complex.\n4. The code IsRecoverable() and RecoveryAction() etc need to access all the three managers. So it may end up a FaultManager. As the three managers need to reference this class as well. I tried future injection, it doesn't work out. \nI am half way of the refactoring, so far I don't see the code is significantly simplified but more complex. \nGiven the time constrains, I would suggest to complete the review of the current version. Make the logic work first. If we still like to refactor it, we can leave it as a separate Jira as it would be purely refactor. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/231246088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/231256274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1069#issuecomment-231256274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1069","id":231256274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTI1NjI3NA==","user":{"login":"jieunparklee","id":20215328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE1MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20215328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee","html_url":"https://github.com/jieunparklee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieunparklee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T01:50:35Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T01:50:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@motus Yes please.
