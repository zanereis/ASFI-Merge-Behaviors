Remaining issues can be addressed later as bugfixes in subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n@bertholdreinwald @nakul02  After spending significant amount of time on trial and error for Mac (and Windows), I think we should only support BLAS on Linux machines for following reasons:\r\n- GNU OpenMP is not enabled by default on Mac, and it requires either downloading GCC or using experimental clang-openmp.\r\n- GNU OpenMP is not supported by Intel MKL on Mac. Hence we see potential degradation due to switching between GNU OpenMP and Intel OpenMP for operations such as conv2d_backward_data.\r\n- To compile with only Intel OpenMP, we need to buy an Intel Compiler. GCC or Clang doesnot allow us to compile with Intel OpenMP.\r\n- Even if we buy Intel OpenMP, the problem remains with OpenBLAS+OpenMP support.\r\n\r\nSince we have already have cmake setup in place, we can always support BLAS on Mac and Windows in future when OpenMP related issues are resolved. \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor your reference, please see below for instructions for compiling BLAS-enabled SystemML on Mac and Windows:\r\n\r\n## 64-bit x86 Windows\r\n- Install MKL or Download the OpenBlas Binary\r\n- Install Visual Studio Community Edition (tested on VS 2017)\r\n- Use the CMake GUI, select the source directory, the output directory\r\n- Press the `configure` button, set the `generator` and `use default native compilers` option\r\n- Set the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Release`, this sets the appropriate optimization flags\r\n- By default, `USE_INTEL_MKL` is selected, if you wanted to use OpenBLAS, unselect the `USE_INTEL_MKL`, select the `USE_OPEN_BLAS`.\r\n- You might run into errors a couple of times, select the appropriate library and include files/directories (For MKL or OpenBLAS) a couple of times, and all the errors should go away.\r\n- Then press generate. This will generate Visual Studio project files, which you can open in VS2017 to compile the libraries.\r\nThe current set of dependencies are as follows:\r\n- MKL: mkl_rt.dll (for functions: `mkl_set_num_threads` and `cblas_dgemm`).\r\n- OpenBLAS: libopenblas.dll (for functions: `openblas_set_num_threads` and `cblas_dgemm`).\r\n- Visual C OpenMP: vcomp140.dll (for function: `omp_get_thread_num`).\r\n- Visual C Runtime: vcruntime140.dll (for functions: `memcpy` and `memset`).\r\n- API-MS-WIN-CRT-ENVIRONMENT-L1-1-0.DLL, API-MS-WIN-CRT-RUNTIME-L1-1-0.DLL and API-MS-WIN-CRT-HEAP-L1-1-0.DLL (for functions: `malloc` and `free`).\r\n- KERNEL32.dll\r\nIf you get an error `Error LNK1181 cannot open input file 'C:/Program.obj'`, \r\nyou may have to use quotation marks around the path in Visual Studio project properties.\r\n- Property Pages > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories\r\n- Property Pages > Linker > Command Line\r\nIf you get an error `CMake Error at cmake/FindOpenBLAS.cmake:71 (MESSAGE): Could not find OpenBLAS`,\r\nplease set the environment variable `OpenBLAS_HOME` or edit the variables `OpenBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR` and `OpenBLAS_LIB`\r\nto point to the `include` directory and `libopenblas.dll.a` respectively.\r\nIf you get an error `install Library TARGETS given no DESTINATION!`, you can comment `install(TARGETS systemml preload LIBRARY DESTINATION lib)` \r\nin CMakeLists.txt and manually place the compiled dll in the `src/main/cpp/lib` directory.\r\n## 64-bit x86 Mac\r\nThe version of clang that ships with Mac does not come with OpenMP. `brew install` either `llvm` or `g++`. The instructions that follow are for llvm:\r\n1. Intel MKL - CMake should detect the MKL installation path, otherwise it can specified by the environment variable `MKLROOT`. To use (with clang):\r\n```\r\nmkdir INTEL && cd INTEL\r\nCXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include cmake  -DUSE_INTEL_MKL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n### (with gcc-6):\r\n```\r\nmkdir INTEL && cd INTEL\r\nCXX=g++-6 CC=gcc-6 cmake  -DUSE_INTEL_MKL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n2. OpenBLAS - CMake should be able to detect the path of OpenBLAS. If it can't, set the `OpenBLAS` environment variable. If using `brew` to install OpenBLAS, set the `OpenBLAS_HOME` environment variable to `/usr/local/opt/openblas/`. To use (with clang):\r\n```\r\nexport OpenBLAS_HOME=/usr/local/opt/openblas/\r\nmkdir OPENBLAS && cd OPENBLAS\r\nCXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include cmake  -DUSE_OPEN_BLAS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n### (with gcc-6):\r\n```\r\nexport OpenBLAS_HOME=/usr/local/opt/openblas/\r\nmkdir OPENBLAS && cd OPENBLAS\r\nCXX=g++-6 CC=gcc-6 -DUSE_OPEN_BLAS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\r\nmake install\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298183415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/298191504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/270#issuecomment-298191504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/270","id":298191504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODE5MTUwNA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-29T20:07:34Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T20:18:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I guess @dusenberrymw  had concerns about this PR.
