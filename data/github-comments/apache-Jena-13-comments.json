I reverted the previous changes, and wanted to keep everything in the branch history in case we decided to go back that way, but messed up with a `git rebase`. Cherry picked a few commits, now it's looking OK.\r\n\r\nSo now this updated pull request is following a different direction. Instead of changing the default behaviour, based on language tags, it contains a 2-parameters \"collation\" function. All changes in ARQ.\r\n\r\nPlease, ignore comments/unit tests/code readability/etc, as what this pull request is right now is a mere suggestion of an alternative for JENA-1313, and may be again discarded in case there are too many problems with this implementation.\r\n\r\nThe FN_Collation.java contains the code for the new function. The first argument is a locale, used for finding the collator. The second argument to the function is the NodeValue (Expr). What the function does, is quite simple - and possibly naïve?. It extracts the string literal from the Expr part, then creates a new NodeValue that contains both String + locale.\r\n\r\nFurther down, the NodeValueString was modified as well to keep track of the string locale. Alternatively, we could create a new NodeValue subtype, instead of adding an optional locale (backward binary compatible change, as we add, but not change existing methods).\r\n\r\nThen, when the SortCondition in the Query is evaluated, and then the NodeValueString#compare method is called, it checks if it was given a desired locale. If so, it sorts using that locale.\r\n\r\nNotice that this function will be applied always in the String Value Space in ARQ, as even when we have a Language Tag, it is discarded and we use only the string. Basically, any node with a literal string will become a NodeValueString, when this function is applied to the node.\r\n\r\nWith this, users are able to choose a Collation, overriding any language tags. This way, if your data contains @en and @en-GB, you can decide to use any Collation you desire on your query.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBruno","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/298205227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/298205335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/237#issuecomment-298205335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/237","id":298205335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODIwNTMzNQ==","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-30T01:40:13Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T01:40:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have a sandbox project here https://github.com/kinow/jena-arq-filter, not really unit tests, but some renamed main methods that I use for experimenting.

I think not because of this approach, but I tried to find if sort could be unstable, and think I found one case.\r\n\r\n> I think it could be avoided by the following logic: If two `NodeValueSortKey`s have different collation languages, sort them by the collation languages instead of even looking at the text.\r\n>\r\n>This is the (lang, lex) approach discussed earlier, just applied in a slightly different context.\r\n\r\nSounds like a plan. Let's wait and see what others think.\r\n\r\nNow, on stability...\r\n\r\nI tried finding ways that the sort would be unstable, but for two values A and B, with same collation, the result would be stable. For two values C and D with different collations, or missing collations, the result would be the sort by the string literal. The node produced would be a `Node_Literal` (function rewrites any node given to it as a `Node_Literal`).\r\n\r\nNow here is the interesting part. `#equals(Object)` and `#hashcode()` use the node value, i.e.  the `Node_Literal` string to compare values. Using the approach suggested by @osma `NodeValue#compare(NodeValue, NodeValue)` for `NodeValueSortKey`(\"Casa\", \"es\") and `NodeValueSortKey`(\"Casa\", \"pt\") would return that `NodeValueSortKey`(\"Casa\", \"es\") < `NodeValueSortKey`(\"Casa\", \"pt\"). i.e. since both values have different collation language tags, we would compare \"es\" and \"pt\".\r\n\r\nHowever, `#equals(Object)` and `#hashcode()` would report true based only on the `Node_Literal` node. So `NodeValueSortKey`(\"Casa\", \"es\").equals( `NodeValueSortKey`(\"Casa\", \"pt\") ) would return true.\r\n\r\nI believe this could cause problems, where the merge-sort sort would be stable (I think), but using the elements (sorted or not) in a map/set could result in weird behaviours...\r\n\r\nSome code to illustrate the above stated:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNodeValueSortKey nvsk1 = new NodeValueSortKey(\"Casa\", \"es\");\r\nNodeValueSortKey nvsk2 = new NodeValueSortKey(\"Casa\", \"pt\");\r\nSystem.out.println(nvsk1.equals(nvsk2));\r\n// true\r\n\r\nNodeValueLang nvl1 = new NodeValueLang(\"Casa\", \"es\");\r\nNodeValueLang nvl2 = new NodeValueLang(\"Casa\", \"pt\");\r\nSystem.out.println(nvl1.equals(nvl2));\r\n// false\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `NodeValueLang`s, when a `Node_Literal` is created, it is given a `LiteralLabel` object that it wraps. Then, when you call `NodeValueLang#equals(Object)`, `NodeValueLang` uses the `LiteralLabel#equals(Object)` to compare the other `NodeValueLang`. `LiteralLabel` is checking the language tag.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should create a new `Node_Concrete` implementation in `org.apache.jena.graph` (Node_SortKey?), or if we should modify `Node_Literal`... I feel like the latter would be less elegant than the former.\r\n\r\nBy using the current implementation, plus @osma's suggestion of comparing the collation language tag, and finally by making sure equals/hashcode agree with what our comparable says; then I believe we would have a stable sort.

It includes a Java IFace and Server implementation and instructions on how to use another language to access the wrapped DSG. This allows a DSG to be accessed in another JVM. This is binary part.\nDatasetGaphMosaic wraps multiple DSG and presents them as one DSG. Useful when the wrapped DSG is a DSG thrift. It will apply optimistic locking and wraps the transaction with a try mechanism. Effectively MRMW with no contention unless writes are to the same DSG. This is clustering part.\nDatasetGaphMirage uses rules to auto magic quads based on the find methods. An example Ray is a folder which is mapped from between a urn: and file: schema and has the ability to load triples and quads to fulfill the find methods calls. This is dynamic part.\nThrift I think is a candidate for core.

This clearly doesn't conflict with existing code. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is some overlap in functionality to earlier attempts at making the analyzer configuration more generic. For example, I think that the equivalent of LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer can now be specified in three different ways: using LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer directly; using ConfigurableAnalyzer to build it from KeywordTokenizer and two filters; or with the new GenericAnalyzer. If we had had functionality like this earlier, then there wouldn't have been any need to create ConfigurableAnalyzer or indeed the pre-packaged LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer. \r\n\r\nBut now I think we must simply support all the different configuration styles. If we want to drop one or more of those options, it should at least be clearly deprecated well in advance. It is not the fault of this PR, just something that has happened as the feature set has grown organically over time.\r\n\r\n+1 for merging after the minor issues identified by @afs have been sorted out.\r\n\r\nI must say that without the excellent documentation updates that come along with this PR, I would be a lot more hesitant to merge this because of the added complexity in index configuration. But with the very clear examples and thorough explanations (also for older jena-text features!), I think this adds a lot of value, even for jena-text users who don't need the full power of this meta-configuration language.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/311625894/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/311679723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/246#issuecomment-311679723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/246","id":311679723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTY3OTcyMw==","user":{"login":"xristy","id":3542294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDIyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy","html_url":"https://github.com/xristy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T14:37:44Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T14:37:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added `JenaSystem.init()` to the jena-text tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/311679723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/311724344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/246#issuecomment-311724344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/246","id":311724344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTcyNDM0NA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T17:04:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T17:04:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xristy  -

There is a syntax extension `CALL` (little know, undocumented; a toy from a long time ago) which is very similar.\r\n\r\n\"FN_Collation\" is related `fn:collation-key` has a specific, different result type specified by the standard.
