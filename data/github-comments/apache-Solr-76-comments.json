Around\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/620175a5626e69823b5aec8e20734a6352195000/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/servlet/SolrDispatchFilter.java#L336\r\n> it appears that MAYBE there is an opportunity for some refactoring to simplify the flow... Especially since we specifically mention the Hadoop Auth as the reason for the extra complexity.. I do not understand this bit and would love another set of eyes.... I could also see a path to updating the very lengthy comments to say \"This has complexity due to hadoop auth partially, and now that it is gone there may be an opportunity for improvement\"...\r\n\r\nI wrote that comment to memorialize several hours of digging I did back when I moved startup to a context listener. One of the things I found perplexing about SolrDispatchFilter when I first tried to understand it for that task was the lack of a call to doFilter(req,resp,filterchain) ... note that our custom version with the boolean retry doesn't count, because it doesn't make the normal call to the method specified by javax.servlet.Filter. Normally filter implementations look like:\r\n\r\n````\r\n  public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)\r\n      throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n\r\n      // Do stuff, that seems important here\r\n\r\n      if (importantStuffSeemsHappy) {\r\n        chain.doFilter(request, response, chain);\r\n      } else {\r\n        // do unhappy error type stuff. (maybe/maybe not doFilter anyway)\r\n      }\r\n     // add try/finally if there is mandatory cleanup.\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nSo it was very weird not to find a call to doFilter in the doFilter method, nor in our custom version of it. EVENTUALLY I figured out that that call is made either in the dispatch method, OR in our auth filter (I haven't tried to prove it can't get called twice, but with just SolrDispatchFilter in play that is not currently going to cause a problem since chain.doFilter is a no-op for the final filter). One of the long term goals I have is to start pulling stuff that we are doing in this monster filter out int a series of filters, which will make the individual missions easier to understand and put the cleanup code near the instantiation code where, again it would be much easier to understand (and nesting can be easily seen to be correct). \r\n\r\nMy impulse (not yet informed by actual attempts) is to rework our auth plugin to be auth filters. The other thing I'm pointing out in that comment is that the HadoopAuthFilter is what seems to stand in the way of writing an if block such as:\r\n\r\n````\r\n      if (authPlugin.authenticate(req, resp)) {            // <<< note the lack of filterchain arg\r\n\r\n        // do searchy stuff here\r\n\r\n        chain.doFilter(request, response, chain);\r\n      } else {\r\n        // do unhappy 401 error type stuff.\r\n      }\r\n     // add try/finally for mandatory cleanups.\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\nThat is of course the first step to breaking auth out to it's own filter where it becomes\r\n\r\n````\r\n  public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)\r\n      throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n        if (authPlugin.authenticate(req, resp)) {            \r\n          chain.doFilter(request, response, chain);   // <<< dispatch filter is later in the chain.\r\n        } else {\r\n          // do unhappy 401 error type stuff.\r\n        }\r\n       // add try/finally for mandatory cleanups.\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe particular issue with the hadoop auth  plugin that complicates the transition is that chain.doFilter() comes before a switch statement and other code...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/solr/blob/6f94c505fc923c452c58c2a3946ee4408ea06fac/solr/modules/hadoop-auth/src/java/org/apache/solr/security/hadoop/HadoopAuthPlugin.java#L247\r\n\r\nAt least at the time of that comment it seemed that all the other plugins called chain.doFilter() at the end (or possibly in a shortcut followed by an immediate return statement). Only Hadoop auth seemed to have mandatory actions AFTER doFilter(). If it disappears, we can possibly remove the filterchain argument and make a simpler use of the return value from authenticate().\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2494228698/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2494322602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2869#issuecomment-2494322602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2869","id":2494322602,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6UrFeq","user":{"login":"hossman","id":450139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDEzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/450139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman","html_url":"https://github.com/hossman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hossman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-22T17:13:59Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T17:13:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't know about the `shutdown()` changes, but moving this logic into a `Rule` seems great, and and using that `@Rule` in `SolrTestCase` (instead of `SolrTestCaseJ4`) seems fine... \r\n\r\nBut I'm curious: why not just leave that `@Rule` in `SolrTestCaseJ4` (for backcompat) and let any other `SolrTestCase` subclasses that want to use this functionality add the `@Rule` themselves? ... isn't that the real value of the `Rule` API, that's it's easy to wire in and mix/match?\r\n\r\nEither way I would suggest updating the `TestLogLevelAnnotations extends ...` declaration to use `SolrTestCase` -- that's the best way to \"prove\" that making these changes \"works\".(There are also some comments in that class that probably need updated? ... i think the code they comment is all still true, but they make references to `SolrTestCaseJ4` that should probably now refer to something else?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2494322602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2495527115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2835#issuecomment-2495527115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2835","id":2495527115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6UvrjL","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-23T16:14:06Z","updated_at":"2024-11-23T16:14:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am going to not touch `SolrDispatchFilter` as I don't have a good game plan to move forward with it!

Also mix/match, yes.  But I don't see why any test would want to opt-out of this one given how cheap/light-weight it is, with its annotation based activation of the underlying Statement wrapper.  I think we want to make it super-easy to debug a test with logs -- just add an annotation.  Likewise I'm grateful other rules are defined always like system property clearing; I don't want tests to waste lines of code over basic book-keeping.

Put differently, do you see runtime manipulation as an important feature/approach for its viability vs editing solrconfig.xml and sending a RELOAD command?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2508199409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2508216592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2809#issuecomment-2508216592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2809","id":2508216592,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6VgFkQ","user":{"login":"alessandrobenedetti","id":513195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti","html_url":"https://github.com/alessandrobenedetti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alessandrobenedetti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-29T18:00:30Z","updated_at":"2024-11-29T18:00:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure, I thought that it was handy to have the vectorisation models as a managed resource, that can be added/deleted/viewed on the fly via REST.\r\nAlso thought managed resources were a natural evolution of the old \"let's put it in the solrconfig.xml or separate files approach\".\r\nThose were my motivations, not much more\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2508216592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2508795505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2815#issuecomment-2508795505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2815","id":2508795505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ViS5x","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-30T02:31:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-30T02:31:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > I think I prefer the GC being explicit instead of relying on whatever JDK value is the default.

Start with at least three nodes for fault tolerance and scalability, and scale horizontally as your needs grow.\r\n\r\n- **Sharding and Replication:** Break your data into shards for parallel processing and use replicas for redundancy. A good starting point is two replicas per shard, but adjust this based on your workload.\r\n\r\n- **Optimize Indexing:** Carefully plan your schema to ensure efficient indexing and querying. Use dynamic fields and copy fields where appropriate to keep things flexible without overloading your system.\r\n\r\n- **Caching for Speed:** Solr provides powerful caching options like query, document, and filter caches. Use these for frequently accessed data to speed up query times significantly.\r\n\r\n- **Tune the JVM:** Since Solr is Java-based, JVM tuning is crucial. Adjust heap size to balance memory usage and garbage collection. Monitor GC logs and experiment with policies like G1GC or CMS for optimal performance.\r\n\r\n**2. Always Use Solr in Cloud Mode**\r\nFor a robust, scalable setup, Solr Cloud Mode is the way to go. This setup requires ZooKeeper, which manages cluster coordination, leader election, and configuration.\r\n\r\n- **ZooKeeper’s Role:** ZooKeeper ensures your Solr cluster runs smoothly by handling shard placement, failover, and configuration changes dynamically.\r\n\r\n- **Backups and Security:** \r\n-Always back up your Solr and ZooKeeper data regularly. Use Solr's built-in backup tools or external snapshot mechanisms for safety.\r\n-Secure your cluster with SSL/TLS, and set up role-based access control, ideally with tools like Apache Ranger. If Ranger isn’t an option, manual permissions management works too.\r\n     \r\n- **Monitoring is Essential:** Keeping an eye on your Solr cluster is crucial for ensuring smooth operations. A great place to start is the Solr Web UI, which provides a user-friendly interface to monitor metrics like query performance, index health, and cache usage. It's easy to use and perfect for quickly spotting any issues. For more advanced needs, you may integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana for custom dashboards and alerting. However, I should mention that I don’t have direct experience with Prometheus or Grafana specifically when working with Solr.\r\n\r\n**Using Scenarios: Real-World Applications of Solr**\r\n**1. Managing Solr for a Large Dataset**\r\nI used open-source Solr as a search engine for a mobile app. Instead of interacting with Solr directly, I managed the setup via ZooKeeper APIs. Here’s what that looked like:\r\n\r\n- **Cluster Configuration:**\r\nThe cluster handled over 100 TB of data spread across 11 physical machines, each running 16 Solr instances.\r\n- **Sharding and Replication:**\r\nData was stored in shards, with each shard having two replicas to ensure fault tolerance and load balancing.\r\n- **Data Storage:**\r\nData was stored directly on the local file system, which was a great fit for this use case.\r\n- **Management Approach:**\r\nInstead of accessing Solr directly, I managed the system via ZooKeeper APIs. This approach, even with an embedded ZooKeeper, worked efficiently under heavy load.\r\n\r\n**2.Using Solr with Cloudera and HDFS**\r\nAnother scenario involved deploying Solr in a Cloudera ecosystem with HDFS for storage. Here’s what worked and what didn’t:\r\n- **Cluster Management:**\r\nZooKeeper handled cluster coordination, while Ranger (and previously Sentry) managed permissions.\r\n- **Challenges:**\r\nOccasionally, node failures caused HDFS file locks, which were difficult to resolve without downtime. These required manual fixes and a lot of patience!\r\n\r\nIf you’ve got questions or need help with something specific, just let me know.

Basically it was a secure token passed around instead of doing the whole roundtrip to the KDC for each call. There are some other things the delegation token can do as well (impersonation if needed). \r\n\r\nAs David said the Hadoop authentication framework is not just Kerberos, but has a whole framework for authentication. Its similar to how Hadoop filesystem support isn't just HDFS but also S3 and some other backends. \r\n\r\nJetty does have Kerberos/SPNEGO support if we want to go down that route later. The Hadoop implementation for Kerberos support was better than most other Java support out there since not many Kerberos and Java implementations historically and lots of bugs across implementations (Active Directory vs Kerby vs others). \r\n\r\nI do think its time to remove this module and make it fully opt in (via a plugin or separately supported module). I haven't had time to keep up with the Hadoop side development of this and don't use it anymore. \r\n\r\nAs Gus pointed out, there are some interesting hooks to make the Hadoop auth client stuff work. so cleaning all of that up is worth it and removing a module that isn't used that widely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2509523158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2509796949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2815#issuecomment-2509796949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2815","id":2509796949,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6VmHZV","user":{"login":"malliaridis","id":33470669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDcwNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33470669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis","html_url":"https://github.com/malliaridis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-01T14:37:25Z","updated_at":"2024-12-01T14:37:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since this PR is only addressing GC log options now, should we address other related issues here as well?

I don't have anything against continued support for javax per se, but there are definitely folks I've worked with that would benefit from being able to eliminate javax classes from their stack. Specifically they got tripped up by the appearance of jakarta based jetty versions (upgraded from other dependencies), which were then providing jakarta HttpServletRequests to tests based on our cloud solr test classes... boom.  The goal with 17503 is to enable folks that integrate with our core code to use jakarta based servlet classes without explosion. If we do additional work to also continue to handle javax that's not a problem so long as Solr stops being the reason people can't upgrade their dependencies that also pull in jetty (or other jakarta based classes). One thing that's already sticky about our situation is our rest api stuff is already on jakarta packages ('jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api'). \r\n\r\nSo IIUC,  EE10 is simple to satisfy SOLR-17503 too, if we do more ok, but how important is that? is it worth the effort? I have a suspicion that we would involve separate artifacts and/or significant config gymnastics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2518447174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2518814930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2809#issuecomment-2518814930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2809","id":2518814930,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6WIhDS","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-05T00:13:19Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T00:13:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Eric, you demonstrate how to save some arbitrary file into the cluster to the so-called \"file store\".

However, the refactoring of the Gradle job and few changes to the web.xml might be required to provide to fully support the current approach.

It will help browser to avoid this issue.

I've added some general [docs in this branch](https://github.com/kotman12/solr/tree/solr-monitor-doc/solr/modules/saved-search) that could help you out. I plan to add it to the refguide but I'm still working through some stuff.\r\n\r\nUntil this is upstreamed though and solr picks up lucene 9.12 (which is in the works) you will have to do this hack:\r\n\r\n1. Build the module and copy `build/packaging/saved-search/` into `solr-9.7.0/modules/` of your solr installation. Alternatively, you can use the one I just built to get started: [saved-search.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18048761/saved-search.zip). You might notice the strange name `aa-solr-saved-search-10.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` .. this is a temporary hack to load saved-search classes _before_ lucene-monitor classes. This won't be necessary once lucene 9.12 is picked up.\r\n2. You can pretty much follow the instructions of [Basic Configuration](https://github.com/kotman12/solr/tree/solr-monitor-doc/solr/modules/saved-search#basic-configuration) in the README but any time you see a classpath pointing to a _new_ class like `solr.SavedSearchUpdateProcessorFactory` .. you will have to replace the resource path with `solr.savedsearch.update.*` or  `solr.savedsearch.cache.*` or  `solr.savedsearch.search.*` depending on the class. That is unless you want to build the whole solr distribution from scratch .. because the resource loader name mapping is in solr-core which I've updated in this PR but is obviously not something you'll pick up if you only patch in the saved-search jar.\r\n3.
