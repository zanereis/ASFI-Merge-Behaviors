When weighing stability (via dep freeze) versus commonsense keeping up (to get bugfixes and features that haven't bitten us _yet_), I think the Beam community particularly benefits from the following, especially considering our recommendation to use AutoValue in contributed transforms.\r\n\r\n> - The classes in the autovalue jar are now shaded with a $ so they never appear in IDE autocompletion.\r\n> - AutoValue now uses its own implementation of a subset of Apache Velocity, so there will no longer be problems with interference between the Velocity that was bundled with AutoValue and other versions that might be present.\r\n> - Explicit check for nested @AutoValue classes being private, or not being static. Otherwise the compiler errors could be hard to understand, especially in IDEs.\r\n> - An Eclipse bug that could occasionally lead to exceptions in the IDE has been fixed (GitHub issue #200)\r\n> - Added logic to AutoValue to detect the confusing case where you think you are using JavaBeans conventions (like getFoo()) but you aren't because at least one method isn't.\r\n\r\nSo you could reasonably file a JIRA with the title \"AutoValue 1.1 -> 1.3 adds bugfixes and features that help us\" with those bullets (or more) in the description, just so anyone curious dropping in would find the most interesting details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/275865471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/275874206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1866#issuecomment-275874206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1866","id":275874206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTg3NDIwNg==","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-28T20:58:02Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T20:58:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:
