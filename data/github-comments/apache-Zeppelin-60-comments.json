Thanks for the update!\n\nIn 'option' section, 'shard | scope | isolated' dropdown is more for how interpreter instances/processes are mapped to notebooks. 'executing' is little bit different from them i think. So how about separate from dropdown list? I think something like a check box could work to toggle 'executing'.\n\nAnd what do you think about use little bit more specific name for label and variable name, instead of 'executing'? for example, 'connectToExistingProcess' or any name that can explain that it is not spawning new interpreter process but connect to existing process.\n\nLastly, this branch somehow includes commits not belongs to this contribution, for example afb1214, c4170b5, etc. Could you make sure that this branch does not include commits from other contributions?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/223997149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/223999965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/969#issuecomment-223999965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/969","id":223999965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzk5OTk2NQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-06T15:46:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-06T15:46:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM

Quick answer for last question. InterpreterResult include new logs only after `getProgress()` called before. See [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/957/files#diff-f9d22f7302ae356454cdcc637942856fR145). Thus logs actually doesn't grow O(N) if getProgress is called periodically. But I'm also finding a better way to reduce memory usage.\n\nAnother problem with this implementation, it cannot covers multi-tenancy at all because that are thread-unsafe and unaware users from interpreter context.\n\nAnd I also think of finding a better name of Remote*.\n\n@felixcheung I'm very glad of you to review this PR, and give some idea.
