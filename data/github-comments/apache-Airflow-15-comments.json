It now fully caches python dependencies after first build. First build can take around 30min, but subsequent builds only around 3min. Further optimization can be done by adding the hadoop downloads to the cache or, only for now, commenting them out as they are not used yet.\n\nI have also included python 3.5 to the build matrix as I saw that was a request somewhere. It fails on the wheel now at the moment as librrabitmq is in the requirements and that is not python 3 compatible yet. Maybe differ between different python versions for the requirements? Anyways its means that 4 builds are now triggered.\n\nIt would be nice if airflow pre-fills its connections for testing. In travis you can use mysql (username root password blank or username travis password blank) and postgres (user: postgres). Both have been pre-configured with a \"airflow\" database that is empty.\nSee http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/ for more details.\n\nEnjoy fixing the tests ;-)!\n- Some issues that might popup: in tox.ini you can specify \"deps=-rrequirements.txt\" but this didn't do anything for me, so I used the commands.

Have `Executor` ship logs of any running tasks to S3 whenever `heartbeat()` is called.  The only issue I see is that it looks like running a task locally uses `LocalTaskJob` but not `LocalExecutor` -- or any executor for that matter (https://github.com/jlowin/airflow/blob/s3_log/airflow/jobs.py#L744). But an extra line of code in LocalTaskJob could solve that.\n2. If the task state is `RUNNING`, serve logs from the worker. Otherwise, get them from S3.

The challenge is to do all this in the scope of a web request: passing a message, picking it up, uploading to s3, passing a message back that says \"done\", rendering the page from s3... Celery doesn't allow to target a specific worker, so that doesn't work, and the heartbeat mechanism may be a little slow to do this interactively.  \n\nDistributed systems are hard.\n\nAt some point I was fed up and said something like \"I swear to god I'm going to setup a mount point for the logs\" and everyone seemed to think it was the absolute worst idea.

Though we had corner cases on the scheduler side that we solved with a shortcut at Airbnb. We fully restart the scheduler every 5 runs to make sure it 100% represents what's in the file system. Corner cases included dag_ids that had moved from a file to another, files getting deleted and the dag_id lingering, ... \n\nWe will address these issues so that no one has to restart the scheduler, but in the meantime you may want to wrap an `airflow scheduler -n 5` (run 5 schedule cycles and exits) command into a bash script or something like runit that restarts it as soon as it's done.\n\nNo need to restart flower.\n\nAs far as the web server goes, you may need to hit the refresh button on the main page, it's the rightmost  icon on the DAGs table view. This \"expires\" the DAG, meaning that the webserver(s) will see that they loaded the DAG before that expiration date and reload it, assuming that it's still in the same file where it found it originally.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/151207096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/151208868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/556#issuecomment-151208868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/556","id":151208868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTIwODg2OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-26T16:58:56Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T16:58:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seems reasonable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/151208868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/151215661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/557#issuecomment-151215661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/557","id":151215661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTIxNTY2MQ==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-26T17:23:23Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T17:23:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.

It can happen for some reason that results of a query are different than expected. We have been bitten by this for example on a cluster upgrade when hive start behaving different and started to return more rows than it should. It would be nice if DAGs could output metrics/stats that are automatically available in a chart on the profiling page so one can monitor data quality. Ideally one can run analytics on these metrics in order to recognize issues by defining boundaries for example. \n\nOf course it can more or less already be done by defining a schema yourself upload it from a task in the DAG and then define it on the data profiling page.

The stats to collect are defined based on rule configuration based on on field naming conventions and data types that you can define yourself.  Say a STRING will collect a APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT and a SUM(LENGTH(s)), and numerical values get SUM/MIN/MAX/STDDEV/... and so on. You can also define custom expressions like SUM(CASE WHEN, ...) and such.\n\nWe use the stats for data quality purposes and anomaly detection. \n\nWe'd be happy to share, though it may not be in a 100% perfect sharable, documented state. I wonder how many folks are interested in stack-specific, higher level constructs built on top of Airflow.
