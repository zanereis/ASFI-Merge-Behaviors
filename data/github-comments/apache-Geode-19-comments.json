The socket itself is thread-safe and properly handles concurrent access, so we're not concerned about multiple threads trying to close this.\r\n\r\nThe real fix here is just the removal of line 734.  With this gone, the nulling of the local variable is only done in the StopServices call and the race condition goes away.  It seems like the volatile is no longer necessary as this variable is no longer being accessed by multiple threads (curiously, with the exception of line 734, the other thread only accessed the socket through a separate local variable), but I'll go ahead and add it back in just to minimize the chances for unintended consequences.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/393614229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/393648800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2005#issuecomment-393648800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2005","id":393648800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzY0ODgwMA==","user":{"login":"bschuchardt","id":7441204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDEyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7441204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/bschuchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T19:25:10Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T19:25:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am very much in favor of not nulling out instance variables.

GEODE-5142 (#1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n@bschuchardt requested changes on this pull request.\r\n\r\nI like the sentiment here but this looks like a dangerous change. It is putting a fixed time limit on execution of arbitrary jobs with no real check to see if threads are stuck or not. If a thread is doing some heavy lifting it could be killed with Thread.stop() in the middle of its work. Think initial image transfer, for instance. This can also leave threads stuck waiting for replies until they, too, are killed.\r\n\r\nKilling threads without knowing what they're really doing could result in data corruption when updating cache values or disk stores. We've seen this before when Thread.interrupt() was used to stop arbitrary threads in an unknown state during shutdown and we stopped doing that.\r\n\r\nI'm against this being merged. If it were changed into a diagnostic tool by getting rid of Thread.stop() I'd look at it again, but I'm not sure it would be much more helpful than a couple of thread dumps.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1868#pullrequestreview-125737507>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/Ak7Mv3Q2gKX4pvP-3bc4Cl71XiYz0kbWks5t5Z2YgaJpZM4TkwN2>.\r\nThis message and the information contained herein is proprietary and confidential and subject to the Amdocs policy statement,\n\nyou may review at https://www.amdocs.com/about/email-disclaimer <https://www.amdocs.com/about/email-disclaimer>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/394586402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/394785264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1868#issuecomment-394785264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1868","id":394785264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDc4NTI2NA==","user":{"login":"metatype","id":2790361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2790361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype","html_url":"https://github.com/metatype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-05T17:00:52Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T17:00:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"-1\r\n\r\nI agree with @PivotalSarge and @bschuchardt.  `Thread.stop()` is scheduled to be removed at some point.

Galen,\r\n\r\nThanks for your review\r\nI will work on the changes u requested – as we prefer to have the option of kill thread available for us, I will try to implement it with a callback as u suggested\r\nFor the third bullet – did u mean to put the entire thread monitor classes in a new package? Something like -  org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.threadMonitor ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nYossi Reginiano\r\n\r\nFrom: galen-pivotal [mailto:notifications@github.com]\r\nSent: Tuesday, June 05, 2018 9:35 PM\r\nTo: apache/geode\r\nCc: Yossi Reginiano; Author\r\nSubject: Re: [apache/geode] Thread Monitoring Mechanism GEODE-5142 (#1868)\r\n\r\n\r\n@galen-pivotal requested changes on this pull request.\r\n\r\nI agree that Thread.stop() absolutely should not be used -- it can result in an exception being thrown almost anywhere and lead to inconsistency in state. It may be useful to detect hangs and do something about them, but we have to rely on some coordination from the thread process. If you wanted the Thread.stop() behaviour and were not worried about data inconsistency, perhaps you could put a callback in the monitor to register such.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I have a few concerns about the code:\r\n\r\n  *   AbstractExecutorGroup actually refers to a single thread; ThreadMonitoring is what monitors a group. The names seem wrong.\r\n  *   setIsThreadStuck is named like a boolean but takes an int\r\n  *   We should move this to its own package, reduce visibility, and be very clear about what the public API for this for the monitoring package is. For example, setThreadMonitoringProcess / getThreadMonitoringProcess.\r\n\r\nIn general, I also think it's a good practice to make as many fields final as possible, so that it's clear what can change.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1868#pullrequestreview-126098962>,

It may be useful to detect hangs and do something about them, but we have to rely on some coordination from the thread process. If you wanted the Thread.stop() behaviour and were not worried about data inconsistency, perhaps you could put a callback in the monitor to register such.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I have a few concerns about the code:\r\n\r\n  *   AbstractExecutorGroup actually refers to a single thread; ThreadMonitoring is what monitors a group. The names seem wrong.\r\n  *   setIsThreadStuck is named like a boolean but takes an int\r\n  *   We should move this to its own package, reduce visibility, and be very clear about what the public API for this for the monitoring package is. For example, setThreadMonitoringProcess / getThreadMonitoringProcess.\r\n\r\nIn general, I also think it's a good practice to make as many fields final as possible, so that it's clear what can change.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1868#pullrequestreview-126098962>,
