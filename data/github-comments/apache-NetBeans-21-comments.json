Instead, we should use [nette.min.php](https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/blob/fa0fe898d43e566e78ab60e9da9909631657a15e/php.editor/test/unit/data/testfiles/actions/testImportData/libs/nette.min.php)(New BSD: 22475 lines, 537 KB) or [Mpdf file](https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf/blob/development/src/Mpdf.php)(GPL: 1.01 MB) which Tomas suggested.\r\n\r\n@tmysik What do you think?\r\n\r\nIf Mpdf file is better, I'll add it as an external file as well.\r\n\r\n> I don't quire get what the changes to html*.php are about.\r\n\r\nWe can see \"Akismet\". Those codes may be part of an external script. So, at least we should not include that word. I found out the similar example code here: https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=124273#c0.\r\n```php\r\n<body><?php\r\n    if ($a == 1){\r\n    ?>    \r\n    <br/><?php                        \r\n    $r =123;               \r\n?><br/>\r\n<?php\r\n}\r\n?>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n So it should be OK, maybe.
