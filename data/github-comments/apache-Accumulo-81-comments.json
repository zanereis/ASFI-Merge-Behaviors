For example:\r\n```java\r\n    Supplier<String> message = () -> \"Calculator.add(2, 2) test failed\";\r\n    assertEquals(3, Calculator.add(2, 2), message);\r\n```\r\nor equivalently \r\n```java\r\n    assertEquals(3, Calculator.add(2, 2), () -> \"Calculator.add(2, 2) test failed\");\r\n```\r\nThis has the benefit of being lazily evaluated so the string will only be created when the message is needed rather than always being created. I am wondering if this possible performance gain is worth the possible (small) decrease in readability/increase in code complexity. This could be something we standardize while the migration of JUnit 4 to 5 takes place since we need to change the order of the assert parameters when there is a message anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts on this?

Hopefully these changes make it easier to debug individual tests. I had a hard time debugging one of the tests in ShellServerIT and it took a while to run the whole IT. For example, now they each get their own directory in mini. I would prefer lots of small tests that take less than a minute to run. Even with this change, ShellServerIT still have ~50 tests in it so I might split out another IT since that is a lot for one IT. One idea I had was to put all the tests that are testing a simple command in one and the rest (which do more complicated things) in another IT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1042325546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1042889951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2503#issuecomment-1042889951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2503","id":1042889951,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM4-KTzf","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-17T12:16:44Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T12:16:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii are you familiar with the test `scansWithClassLoaderContext` in ShellServerIT ?

See the note at https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.3/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkGuarantees.\r\n\r\nMy guess would be doing that could possibly make mutateExisting loop less in the case of concurrent updates (and therefore possibly perform better?).  I don't think its needed for correctness though.  Knowing if its worthwhile for performance seems tricky because sync() read may be more expensive, so is that offset by possibly looping less.

If I remember correctly, most lines are shorter with TimeUnit, even more so if you static import the type, as in `HOURS.toMillis(24)`, but Duration might be better in some cases. Duration might also use more object creation whereas TimeUnit is an enum, basically a bag of singletons.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1046686133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1047006634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2397#issuecomment-1047006634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2397","id":1047006634,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM4-aA2q","user":{"login":"Manno15","id":29436247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDM2MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29436247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15","html_url":"https://github.com/Manno15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-21T15:38:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T15:38:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems the issue is the if statement is true so it throws the RuntimeException.
