We were noticing too small Flowfiles compared to the \"maxPollRecords\"  when handling production Flows ( up to over 250'000msg/s ), on a secured Kafka cluster in a non trivial network layout. \r\nThe fixed 10ms timeout per single poll roundtrip led to undeterministic polling results, reporting \"no more records\" after  ~200 messages on average, never mind \"maxPollRecords\" and \"maxWatingMilllis\" being very high. (we would have preferred ~10000msg/FF)\r\nIn a simple, unsecured Lab setting, we could not reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, \"maxWaitmillis\" is the maximum time a Nifi-KafkaConsumer-Processor can use up to fill a FlowFile, whereas x in kafkaConsumer.poll(x) is the timeout for a single Kafka-transaction.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should not put the user supplied-maWaitMillis directly here, but also a lower bound of the previously hard-coded 10ms ?
