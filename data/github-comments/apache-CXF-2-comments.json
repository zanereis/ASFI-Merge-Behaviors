We are trying to give a feature of maxRetries as well so that customers can configure on their own as per their needs. Thus, I would still suggest we put a loop controller with maxRetries as in the original code from this pull request. Further there are 2 problems in addition\n1. If a thread interrupts the loop, you are not cleaning up the resources done in method deactivate(). It simply is coming out without cleaning up the resources.\n2. We are still not giving control to the customer using this feature to control the maxRetries and coming out of the loop without interrupting the thread.\n3. Also, in addition to that, Thread.sleep() should be put in try block before deactivate as done in original code in this pull request since it does not make sense to retry immediately the JMS Connection. Thread.sleep will allow a grace period for Queue Mgr to come up and thus, we should keep Thread.sleep before deactivate and put maxRetries back in loop to come out of the endless loop\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/213021417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/213348723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/132#issuecomment-213348723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/132","id":213348723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzM0ODcyMw==","user":{"login":"cschneider","id":484584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDU4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/484584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider","html_url":"https://github.com/cschneider","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T09:19:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T09:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I do not yet see a good case for limiting the number of retries as the cxf endpoint would be unusable at this point.

The client may not like to continue the retry infinite times due to the CPU Spikes that they can experience unnecessarily after every completion of thread.sleep. Also, this situation becomes worst if a single JVM has >50 JMS Destination Listeners defined and a single physical host has multiple such JVMs. In such scenario, client would still see high CPU when it continues to do infinite retries. Thus it makes sense to give flexibility to client in terms of exposing both retries and retryinterval.\n\nAlso for point 2, I was trying to avoid need for client to put custom solution to call explicitly shutdown on JMSDestination as well. ALso, if you note, shutdown variable is proned to race condition since its not defined volatile. If you call shutdown from another Thread, and the retry thread is still looping in another thread, the change in the value of shutdown variable may not be instantaenously visible to other thread.\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/213663398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/215464414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/129#issuecomment-215464414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/129","id":215464414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTQ2NDQxNA==","user":{"login":"cschneider","id":484584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDU4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/484584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider","html_url":"https://github.com/cschneider","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschneider/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T15:23:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T15:23:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I checked with Dan Kulp how to solve the multiplicity of the busses.

What would be a use case to use such precise and not really straightforward Swagger configuration in CXF? I think the approach with path-based configuration (which essentially does the same trick by manipulating scanner/config ids) is simpler and does not really expose the internals of Swagger to CXF users. Plus, we could just make it a default behavior so the need to manipulate  scanner/config ids would be a very rare exception if at all. \n\nWhat do you think?\nThank you.\n\nBest Regards,\n    Andriy redko\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/241290128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/241333220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/160#issuecomment-241333220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/160","id":241333220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTMzMzIyMA==","user":{"login":"splatch","id":199488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch","html_url":"https://github.com/splatch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-22T07:25:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T07:25:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Indeed, this binds cxf more to swagger than relying only on swagger option, however this one offered consistency with Swagger approach.
