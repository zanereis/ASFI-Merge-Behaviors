@guimingyue ,\r\n\r\nI gave a look at your repo, and basically, it is on the right way to do query optimization. : )\r\nHere are some of my thought about how to leverage Calcite to do query optimization and SQL federation for ShardingSphere.\r\n\r\n@junwen12221  @guimingyue\r\nWhat's your thinking about the process below?  Welcome your any comments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Process\r\n\r\n#### Preparation\r\n\r\n- Create SQL Parser using configuration\r\n- Create Calcite schema factory using `sharding rules` (TODO)\r\n- Put the reference of ` Calcite schema` and `Calcite context` in `SchemaContexts` for the following SQL optimization and SQL federation  (TODO) \r\n\r\n#### Parse (DONE)\r\n\r\n- ShardingSphere parser parses SQLs as an AST or SQLStatement\r\n\r\n[SQLStatement](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/blob/master/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-statement/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/sql/parser/sql/common/statement/SQLStatement.java) is a concise object of a String SQL and generated by Antlr visitor.\r\n\r\n#### Optimize (TODO) @guimingyue \r\n\r\n- ShardingSphere optimizer transforms `SQLStatement` to `SqlNode` of `Calcite`\r\n- ShardingSphere optimizer applies some of the rules (e.g., CoreRules or EnumerableRules) to perform logical transformations on relational expressions\r\n- ShardingSphere optimize returns a optimized `RelNode` (BestPlan)\r\n\r\n#### Execute (TODO)\r\n\r\n- Create Calcite raw executor\r\n- Execute SQL by `InterpretableConverter` of `Calcite`\r\n- Packaging `Enumerable<Object[]>` and `ResultSetMetaData` as `QueryResult` of `ShardingSphere`\r\n- Pass the execution result, i.e., `QueryResult` to `executeEngine` of `ShardingSphere`\r\n\r\n---\r\nPlus, @guimingyue, It looks you need at least a `ShardingSphereCalciteSchema` to do SQL  optimization. I will first try to finish the **preparation** part next week. After that, you can use the Calcite Context for the optimation module (**Ready to raise a PR at this time**).  BTW, my task seems not a blocker for your work. Just pretend you have a `ShardingSphereCalciteSchema` and continue Sqlnode transformation work. : )\r\n\r\n@junwen12221 I am unsure whether you have time programming? If not, could you help review the succeeding PRs?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/743767420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/743968723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/8601#issuecomment-743968723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8601","id":743968723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Mzk2ODcyMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-13T07:42:23Z","updated_at":"2020-12-13T07:42:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

But this way will make `DataSourceConfiguration` senses `Driver Types`.\r\n\r\n### HikariJDBCParameterDecorator\r\nThat's a specific class to decorate properties to `HikariCP`, a proper place to do some exclusive works for a certain Driver pool. So we can give `exceptionOverrideClassName` a proper value here. Meanwhile, we have to move this class from `proxy` module to maybe `infra` module.\r\n\r\nFor me, I prefer the first one to avoid the impact of other setting operations in `HikariJDBCParameterDecorator`.
