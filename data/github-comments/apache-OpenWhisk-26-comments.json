Here are a few reasons for keeping the message concatenation processing as it is.  Encapsulation - each error object is responsible and stores it's own error message; only pull in another object's error information when it is needed.  Secondly, while memory consumption is not really an issue for the CLI right now, concatenation the sub-error message would increase memory consumption for errors that are made up of a series of error objects.  Also, there's not much performance savings by concatenating each message during the error object construction since the CLI only calls toString() once.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232446271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232466696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/884#issuecomment-232466696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/884","id":232466696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjQ2NjY5Ng==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-13T19:50:37Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T19:50:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"IPG

proposal:\n- All blocking action activations will return 20x regardless of `status/statusMessage` if the activation results in an activation record. the rationale is that the request completed and produced the activation record. The system did its job, it ran the action, and produced the activation record that includes the details of the activation.\n- Blocking activations that are converted into non-blocking activations continue to return 202 (accepted). This can arise if the system is temporarily overloaded and the request was accepted but not yet processed completely.\n- Blocking activations that fail with internal (system) errors will continue to yield a 50x response.\n\nOf course for invoking an action that doesn't exit, or one that the subject is not authorized to, or if the subject does not authenticate, or if the request is throttled, or if the content payload is not a JSON object will return 40x level errors.\n\nThis simplifies the API and pushes the idea that the HTTP status code is not what you should rely on to determine if the activation result was what you expect it. This is also more in line with Lambda for reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html#API_Invoke_ResponseSyntax but where Lambda returns headers e.g., `X-Amz-Function-Error` whisk returns a JSON object with properties for status, log, the result, and other activation details.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232534948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232672456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/713#issuecomment-232672456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/713","id":232672456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjY3MjQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"perryibm","id":14339749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzM5NzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14339749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm","html_url":"https://github.com/perryibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perryibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-14T13:55:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T13:55:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For me, the magical 2 seconds is not needed anymore.

It means you are making all rules unique. To get back the functionality of having named ruled you will create more than one trigger for the scenario I describe which means two feeds instead - so you traded two rules for two feeds. A feed is more heavyweight (to manage) than a rule. Alternatively you trade two rules for two actions `A_S1` and `A_S2` which now means no shared code and updating the same action code twice when there is a need to change `A`, and still have to create the rule for `T` to `A_S1` and `A_S2`.\n\nNow imagine more than 2 apps that want to consume the same feed but where you want to allow individual control over the rule. \n\nThis isn't a hypothetical scenario either. Dark vision uses one cloudant feed and two rules, one for Watson vision analysis and the other for thumbnail generation. \n\nFurther, what's the advantage of \n`wsk trigger associate triggerName actionName` vs \n`wsk rule create triggerName actionName` which we can add to create an anonymous rule and \n`wsk rule create ruleName triggerName actionName` where the rule is created with a name.\n\nAnd what about `enable` and `disable` for the rule? You suggest these become trigger `associate` and `disassociate` which is more like rule `create` and `delete` so now enable/disable which afford the ability to pause/resume a rule without having to recreate it become create/delete.\n\nSo the totality of augmenting the CLI commands for triggers and the API for triggerrs is to bloat and conflate concerns for what is otherwise a simple API for orthogonal concepts.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232897171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232898185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/894#issuecomment-232898185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/894","id":232898185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjg5ODE4NQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T08:55:00Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T08:55:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PPG

The memory vs. hd storage aside, we need to limit storage for containers. A user container is basically a function call. It should not have the need to store anything locally besides runtime data. Why would a stateless, serverless function need to store any data on a disk anyway?\n\nThe 512 MB limit is mostly helpful for blackbox containers where you are free to do whatever you like. When you are in a swift action or nodejs action, you are basically using a runtime instead of the naked container, so storing files on disk is even less relevant.\n\nBesides, the user code can not rely on being in the same container the next time it gets invoked.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232915255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/232918730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/867#issuecomment-232918730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/867","id":232918730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjkxODczMA==","user":{"login":"jberstler","id":7012682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTI2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7012682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler","html_url":"https://github.com/jberstler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T10:35:27Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T10:35:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mdeuser @dubeejw Before merging this, please make sure that someone independently checks out this change.
