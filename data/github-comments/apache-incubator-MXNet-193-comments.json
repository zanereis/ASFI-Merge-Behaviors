Interesting, thanks. So by and large my guess was correct? The symbol is GPU optimized whereas the module is more general, but also has a class that links into the optimized symbol through the FusedCell? In which case, I would presume that users should probably always be using the module and simply call the FusedCell if they want cudnn optimization.
