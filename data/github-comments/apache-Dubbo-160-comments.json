  }\r\n        return buf.toString();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut in fact if we use a default group (in provider) , so we get a group null here\r\n\r\nIn offline command\r\n```java\r\nprivate boolean

version = getParameter(Constants.VERSION_KEY);\r\n        if (version != null && version.length() > 0) {\r\n            buf.append(\":\").append(version);\r\n        }\r\n        return buf.toString();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt's in different way .So this command may fail to work
