@lightning-pro, \r\n\r\nI just go through all the messages on this issue. You already have a lot of findings.\r\nI need the clear and brief answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have you tested by connecting to MySQL directly? How about the result?\r\n2. Have you tested by connecting to Sharding-Proxy with raw Connector/J? How about the result?\r\n3. Is there a bug in Sharding-Proxy? Is the bug related with certain connection pool like bitronix ?\r\n4. I think you have already found out the root cause, but I can't get the point. Can you figure it out?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/559952725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/559968597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3617#issuecomment-559968597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3617","id":559968597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTk2ODU5Nw==","user":{"login":"avalon566","id":48051589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDUxNTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48051589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566","html_url":"https://github.com/avalon566","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avalon566/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-30T13:36:22Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T13:36:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The progress data look like this\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": \"0\",\r\n    \"job_name\": \"\",\r\n    \"data_node_progress\": [{\r\n        \"id\": \"{host}-{port}-{schema}\"\r\n        \"stage\": \"prepare/history_data/realtime_data/stopped\",\r\n        \"history_data_progress\": [{\r\n            \"id\": \"{schema}-{table}-split#0\"\r\n            \"expected_rows\": 0\r\n            \"sycned_rows\": 0\r\n        }],\r\n        \"realtime_data_progress\": {\r\n            \"id\": \"{schema}-realtime\"\r\n            \"log_positon\": 0,\r\n            \"delay_second\": 0\r\n        }\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/559968597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560062931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/3596#issuecomment-560062931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3596","id":560062931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDA2MjkzMQ==","user":{"login":"wgy8283335","id":22066046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDY2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22066046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335","html_url":"https://github.com/wgy8283335","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T06:11:26Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T06:11:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/run ci","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/560062931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
