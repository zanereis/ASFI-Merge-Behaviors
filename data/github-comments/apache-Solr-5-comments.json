I think a lot of them stem from using stuff like Preconditions, which pass a generic error back to the User and doesn't tell them what they need to do to fix the problem. I agree with @madrob , we shouldn't have any Preconditions in this code. Same for `Objects.requireNonNull`.\r\n\r\nSounds like there are two separate issues here: (1) usage of Preconditions/Objects for pre-checking, and (2) a lack of human readable errors when failing those checks.\r\n\r\nRegarding (2), I agree slightly -- for methods that use parameters that are user-specified, we should add better messaging that can help remediate. I'm not sure that'll be helpful everywhere though, since some methods are deeper in the call stack and use variables that have already been post-processed in some way.\r\n\r\nRegarding (1), I'm fine ripping out Preconditions usages. But we can also add some of these messages without getting rid of Objects.requireNonNull (there's a two-arg method for supplying the message), any objection to

Depending on how complex the \"thing\" is, it might be all on a single page or on multiple pages.\r\n\r\nSo following this organizational idea, I think the Schema Designer should move from being a child of `solr-admin-ui.adoc` (where it feels a little orphaned organizationally, being the only child page there) to being a child of either `solr-schema.adoc` or `fields-schema-design.adoc` - that's where all the content about Solr's schema generally and the specifics of the schema elements live now.\r\n\r\nI understand why you may have thought to put it under `solr-admin-ui.adoc`, since that page lives under Getting Started, and you stated you wanted the Schema Designer to be a getting started tool. Moving it may seem like it prevents that, but I think we could highlight within the various pages under Getting Started (like in `documents-fields-schema-design.adoc`, for one, but also others) that the tool exists. But by moving it, when people do use the docs for the tool, they have access through the left nav to the related ideas and documentation that they need.

I have some local changes that generally make the experience better, in my opinion. Will probably push soon, but the biggest change is this:\r\n\r\nIt removes the ability for the s3 object name to start with a `/`. This is because figuring out the correct location URI to use was beyond confusing to me when the `/` was required to start. If we auto-remove any `/` at the begging of the location (and update some of the logic around this), then it's practically impossible for users to pass a `location` that results in an error.\r\n\r\nThis is a major change, but I think a big improvement in terms of usability. Is there a reason why you mandated paths that start with `/` in the first place? This doesn't seem to be an S3 standard, and is definitely not easy to do when creating directories in the S3 UI...\r\n\r\nI've made some other changes that I think are good and do not negatively impact s3 performance. Will post this patch when y'all have signed off on the change above ^.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there are things that need to be done before this is ready to be merged:\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation of the S3 Repo option in the solr-ref-guide\r\n- [x] The tests currently have a lot of asserts without comments, these should be easy to debug when tests fail. Please add messages to any asserts there.\r\n- [x] Finish debugging the async error, if it still occurs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/893609933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/893768746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/243#issuecomment-893768746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/243","id":893768746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM41RdQq","user":{"login":"madrob","id":1592330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTIzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob","html_url":"https://github.com/madrob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madrob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-05T20:17:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T20:17:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

again @HoustonPutman for your time and energy on this PR.\r\n\r\n> This is a major change, but I think a big improvement in terms of usability. Is there a reason why you mandated paths that start with / in the first place? This doesn't seem to be an S3 standard, and is definitely not easy to do when creating directories in the S3 UI...\r\n\r\n@psalagnac might know better than me, but looking through our internal commit history, I don't see any clear reason why we chose to require a leading slash. Given our logic for parsing out parent dirs, maybe there was some code in Solr 7 (the version we were on at the time) that choked on it not starting with a slash? I agree with your logic, and no time like the present to fix it.\r\n\r\nYour other fixes look good to me -- I like using content-type as an indicator for dirs, and the `createDirectoryUri` refactor is also nice.\r\n\r\nHave you been testing against real s3? Or against the mock s3 locally? After syncing the latest, I'm no longer able to restore with mock s3.
