But I can also see that these customizations are opinionated, maybe some \"nice\" features are not desirable for some other people.\r\n\r\nFrom my personal experience, my team also defined some Intellij run configurations for people to use to simplify testing and published in a repo, and people kept changing those to fit their own need. So we ended up just showing all the configurations in a wiki, and people can pick whatever they want. The `.idea` folder is ignored anyway, so it does not impact anyone else. I think this might be another way we can follow here to have Intellij configurations as a part of the developer guide (#3485).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/963410861/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/963428126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3400#issuecomment-963428126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3400","id":963428126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845bL8e","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T18:11:03Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T18:11:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing everyone!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/963428126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/963440771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3275#issuecomment-963440771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3275","id":963440771,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845bPCD","user":{"login":"nssalian","id":8526007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MjYwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8526007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian","html_url":"https://github.com/nssalian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nssalian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T18:26:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T18:26:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue  @jackye1995 , would like to see this merged in.

Execute the command: \r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew -DflinkVersions=1.12 iceberg-flink:iceberg-flink-1.12:build -x test\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/964925966/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/964927551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3518#issuecomment-964927551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3518","id":964927551,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845g6A_","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T09:15:46Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T09:15:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Close this issue now,  feel free to reopen it if have more questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/964927551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/964947287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3095#issuecomment-964947287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3095","id":964947287,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX845g-1X","user":{"login":"Initial-neko","id":40999666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTk5NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40999666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko","html_url":"https://github.com/Initial-neko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Initial-neko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T09:37:41Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T09:37:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > > > @MOBIN-F It's true, this PR translate update to -D and +I.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > It will query the record(1,qq). but this record is from before the update, Is that right?\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > If you don't query op of data, you will get only one result (1,aa).\r\n> \r\n> Sorry, I don't understand how to get only one result(1,aa).

I would expect only very advanced users to provide an entire custom `EncryptionManager` implementation. \r\n\r\nI also think this is a simpler and cleaner approach for organizations and their users. One developer/ team would implement the KmsClient class for their organization, integrating with the local KMS and IAM services (the KmsClient interface should be able to support any). Once the implemented class is deployed, any authorized user in the org can write encrypted tables, passing only one parameter - a string with the table key name (later, we'll add column keys). The readers don't need to pass anything. Both writers and readers use auth credentials (KMS-specific). \r\nLast but not least, this approach is based on the standard \"envelope encryption\" practice.\r\n\r\n> during the discussion I remember Ryan was for having these key generation logic directly in the manager itself as a `BaseKmsEncryptionManager`. I think adding that part of the logic here can facilitate the discussion.\r\n\r\nOne area where we might need to expand the basic approach, described above, is custom encrypted file streaming. By default, Iceberg will use its built-in encryption for the tables (PME/ORC for data; GcmStream for metadata, and potentially for Avro data; we can also add a built-in AwsS3ClientStream in Iceberg). But if an organization prefers to use its custom encryptors instead of those built in Iceberg, we can load them. I'm sending a new commit to this PR, that adds an interface currently called BaseKmsEncryptionManager. The name and content are a subject for discussion.\r\n\r\n> I think it's beneficial to also include code about how this class will be used in `EncryptionManager`. \r\n\r\nWe have an internal implementation of EncryptionManager, a class called EnvelopeEncryptionManager that uses a KmsClient plug-in, and leverages the \"envelope encryption\" practice.
