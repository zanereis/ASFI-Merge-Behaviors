 Personally, I'm not a fan of this change.  It breaks makefile protocol and expected behavior, in that it forces removal of files in order to re-build them instead of detecting they are out of date with sources.\r\n\r\nI understand that our makefiles are not in particularly good shape of re-building things unnecessarily, so that is why I'm not a -1.\r\n\r\nThis is an ugly work-around rather than fixing makefiles.

Ideally, makefiles should be written so that if none of the source files have changed, make does not rebuild anything. But if a source file changes, then the right things do get re-built without needing to do make clean. \r\n\r\nRight now, we have the problem of way too much re-building that does not need to be done.  With your change, we have less of that problem, but the developer needs to know what to remove/clean if they do need to re-build something.  That may be a better problem to have.  It just goes against the ideal makefile methods.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n     Trafci_jar:\r\n\t    mvn clean install -DskipTests\r\n\r\nThis rule always runs becuase \"Trafci_jar\" is not a real file, instead make is asking maven to make sure it is up to date, but maven is told not to trust existing objects by doing clean first. (Ugh).  You are changing this to:\r\n\r\n    Trafci_jar:\r\n    \t@if [ ! -f target/trafciInstaller.jar ] ; then \\\r\n     \t    \t   mvn install -DskipTests ; \\\r\n     \tfi\r\n\r\nWhich is not running maven at all regardless of dependencies if the jar exists.  The simpler way to write that rule is:\r\n\r\n     target/trafci.jar:\r\n              mvn install -DskipTests\r\n\r\n(Replacing all references of \"Trafci_jar\" in the makefile with the full jar file name.)  Even better would be something like this:\r\n\r\n     target/trafci.jar: src/main/java/org/trafodion/ci/*\r\n              mvn install -DskipTests\r\n\r\nWhich would cause a rebuild if any sources in that directory changed.  Other dependencies may also be needed, and nice to have.  But at least use the simpler makefile syntax instead of shell script in the rule.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, the rules are even more complicated because there are two different pom files in the same directory that probably interfere with each other.  So fixing this is not easy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/454882627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/455026323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1578#issuecomment-455026323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1578","id":455026323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTAyNjMyMw==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T03:09:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T03:09:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Check
