I think your PR makes Zeppelin support separate users within a same instance. I have two questions regarding current behaviour. The first is about collaborative mode. If some users want to share their notebook to others which are able to login in same Zeppelin instance, and enable them to run it, how can user do that? The second one is about running interpreter instance. For now, Zeppelin supports three mode for different notes to run an interpreter, 'shared', 'scoped', 'isolated'. But in your PR, because you make interpreterFactory divided by users, all interpreters run a 'isolated' mode for all users. This means that if hundred users run simple markdown interpreter, Zeppelin launches same number of JVM on a same host. My PR considers that situation but your PR divide interpreterFactory by user, then will break my consideration. What do you think of it?\n\nAnd complexity of configuration, @corneadoug will help to make intuitive menu.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/244979768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/244990608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1380#issuecomment-244990608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1380","id":244990608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDk5MDYwOA==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T15:33:57Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T15:33:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo I've misunderstood your comment.

Given Zeppelin ships with Spark 2.0 as default, and you can't have multiple SparkContexts (e.g. a Spark 1.6 and a Spark 2.0) it's likely this 'terp would be dead on arrival for many users.  \n\nNew thought, based on a lot of work I've been doing recently- create a python script that in essence updates `conf/interpreter.json` with a new interpreter based on the current Spark interpreter, and adds the required libraries and configurations (such as the Kryo serializers), resulting in something called `%sparkMahout`\n\nA much lighter weight version of what you can see here in principal:\n[create a new interpreter](https://github.com/rawkintrevo/bluemix-extra-services/blob/master/data/services/zeppelin.py#L166)\n [update a spark interpreter with Mahout configs](https://github.com/rawkintrevo/bluemix-extra-services/blob/master/data/services/zeppelin.py#L68)\n\nIn addition, a page or two of documentation in Zeppelin saying, \"If you want to use Mahout with Apache Spark, you have to have Spark 1.5 or 1.6 (until Mahout is Spark2 compliant), go here run this python script, it will be created.  Here is some basic useage on Mahout and links to some other good getting started material\"\n\nSo in short we would scrap all of this code, and replace it with some docs and a python script that would create a more resilient (based on my experience) interpreter, that will be far less likely to give users a negative experience with Zeppelin or Mahout.\n\nThoughts? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/245400610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/245418230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1409#issuecomment-245418230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1409","id":245418230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTQxODIzMA==","user":{"login":"rawkintrevo","id":5852441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTI0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5852441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/rawkintrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rawkintrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-07T21:02:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T21:15:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Flink Tests all passing now.

Ready to hear ?\n\n1) First issue is we **do not** set the InterpreterSetting `status` and `errorReason` together. For example here: https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/InterpreterFactory.java#L398\n\n``` java\n    ...\n    setting.setStatus(InterpreterSetting.Status.DOWNLOADING_DEPENDENCIES);\n    interpreterSettings.put(setting.getId(), setting);\n    ...\n```\n\n So here we set the status to `DOWNLOADING_DEPENDENCIES` but the `errorReason` stills contains the previous value, possible something like \"Cannot download dependency x.y.z ....\". That explains why we see \n\n```\n...\n    \"status\":\"DOWNLOADING_DEPENDENCIES\",\n    \"errorReason\":\"Could not find artifact one:two:jar:1.1.1 in central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)\",\n...\n```\n\n2) Second issue is more serious, it is concurrency issue. We set the status of the dependency download in a separate thread: https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/InterpreterFactory.java#L400-L433\n\n``` java\n...\ncatch (Exception e) {\n            logger.error(String.format(\"Error while downloading repos for interpreter group : %s,\" +\n                    \" go to interpreter setting page click on edit and save it again to make \" +\n                    \"this interpreter work properly.\",\n                setting.getGroup()), e);\n            setting.setErrorReason(e.getLocalizedMessage());\n            setting.setStatus(InterpreterSetting.Status.ERROR);\n...\n```\n\nThe problem is that the initial status is set to `DOWNLOADING_DEPENDENCIES` and then the interpreter status is returned by the caller class to the client:  https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/rest/InterpreterRestApi.java#L113-L135\n\nI added extra log message to debug:\n\n```\n            ...\n            logger.info(\"************** DEBUG_ZEPPELIN setting status ERROR\");\n            setting.setStatus(InterpreterSetting.Status.ERROR);\n            setting.setErrorReason(e.getLocalizedMessage());\n            ...\n\n    ...\n    logger.info(\"************** DEBUG_ZEPPELIN setting debug \" + setting.toDebugString());\n    return new JsonResponse<>(Status.OK, \"\", setting).build();\n    ...\n```\n\n And below is what is displayed in the logs:\n\n```\nINFO [2016-09-07 12:35:26,151] ({qtp240166646-20}

I think we need more fine grained approach here and let every method/feature implementor to be able to send `ERROR_INFO` message on his own catch statement for say `PROPAGATE_USER_EXCEPTION` with the message specific to error and throw other kinds of errors up to the logs. does that makes sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/245803106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/245805466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1330#issuecomment-245805466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1330","id":245805466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTgwNTQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-09T02:59:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T02:59:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mwkang could you re-trigger CI?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/245805466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/245809428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1404#issuecomment-245809428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1404","id":245809428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTgwOTQyOA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-09T03:29:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T03:29:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo  Can you guide me how to run this test ?
