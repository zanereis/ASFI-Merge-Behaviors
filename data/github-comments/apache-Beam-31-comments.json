We have only _configured_ the RAT plugin in the release profile, which Jenkins uses. We probably meant to only _execute_ it in the `release` profile, but configuration should be global. So you can get the proper excludes on the command line with `-Prelease`. I will fix this separately.\n2. RAT includes defaults for IDEs to exclude things like Eclipse's `.settings` and `.classpath` but the exclude patterns are not correct in the presence of subprojects. I will also fix this.\n\nWhen I fix these two issues locally, the remaining RAT failure is `runners/gearpump/README.md`. Obviously we want it. The issue is that your `README.md` needs to have the Apache license header in a comment. See the source code for any of the other `README.md` files.\n\nI would fix this for you and merge to a feature branch, but since it is a licensing issue I think it best that you make the edits.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/233704477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/233706290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/688#issuecomment-233706290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/688","id":233706290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzcwNjI5MA==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T17:28:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T17:28:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R:

That way we can test the code without relying on the service.\n\nFor integration tests: I'm assuming that there's no \"free, public\" Kinesis installation anywhere nor a single-machine version we can run? For KafkaIO, we run a local Kafka instance during unit tests. For several other services, we have an Apache Beam account where we have set it up specifically for testing. We may need to set up something similar for continuous integration testing of Kinesis. We'll have to figure out how we could get accounts, etc. with the right Apache control to do so.\n\nAs far as writing an end-to-end test.. If you look at [BigtableIO tests, e.g., BigtableReadIT](https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigtable/BigtableReadIT.java) you'll see how those are set up. They are setup as Surefire integration tests (disabled by default) and they typically rely on pipeline options to be set in the environment variables + manually turning them on in order to run. In this manner, someone with access to a Kinesis installation can run the test by setting up the right test pipeline options.\n\nIn terms of things we need to do before merging .. someone can run your integration test manually and defer Jenkins-ifying it until later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/233836850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/233836973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/687#issuecomment-233836973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/687","id":233836973,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzgzNjk3Mw==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T04:44:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T04:44:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When you say \"run this on real Dataflow\" can you say more?\n- Beam HEAD with the Google Cloud Dataflow runner?\n- Google Cloud Dataflow SDK for Java 1.6.0?\n\nsomething else?\n\nMore info, I can look into it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/233836973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/233837068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/687#issuecomment-233837068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/687","id":233837068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzgzNzA2OA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T04:45:49Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T04:45:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Finally, I wanted to say thanks for porting forward from your PR against the Dataflow SDK to the Beam SDK here.
