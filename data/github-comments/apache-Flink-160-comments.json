I see the idea behind the fix.\r\n\r\nI am unsure whether we should let Flink manage the permissions of these directories.

is something probably worth of a mailing list discussion.\r\nI would put this on hold until we have a decision there.\r\n\r\nIf we want this change, we still need to do it a bit different, as we are

It may have worked with a smaller file, but there may be issues with heavier jobs.\r\n\r\nHow silly of me. This problem had nothing to do with this pull request, with YARN, with issues in Flink, or with the size of the input file at all. I was using `ExecutionEnvironment.from_elements` to generate a large sequence of indexed zeroes to fill in the gaps of another indexed DataSet with zeroes. However, when I was using large input files, I set larger parameters and generated larger zero sequences. Because I was using `from_elements`, the client needed to send all of those values (lots and lots of zeroes) to the runtime, which was very time-consuming and caused the timeout. I have replaced this with a `generate_sequence` call and a map function, which does not require sending lots and lots of values from the client to the runtime, and the job (and this pull request) seem to work just fine.\r\n\r\n(change in question: https://github.com/quinngroup/pyflink-r1dl/commit/00a16d564bfad21fc1f4958677ada0a95fa9f088)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280436754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280526553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3335#issuecomment-280526553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3335","id":280526553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDUyNjU1Mw==","user":{"login":"WangTaoTheTonic","id":5276001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzYwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5276001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic","html_url":"https://github.com/WangTaoTheTonic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T01:58:38Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T01:58:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @greghogan , I'm not sure I understand the relationship between HDFS ACLs and this change I proposed.

I have a prototype commit that exposes side outputs using `ProcessFunction`.\r\n - I removed `CollectorWrapper`/`RichCollector` in favour of the `ProcessFunction` approach\r\n - The internal implementation now doesn't store the `OutputTag` on the `StreamRecord` but instead adds an additional method on `Output` that should be used for emitting data to a side output. Side outputs now also work with chaining.\r\n - `WindowedStream` is changed to add a `sideOutputLateData()` method that is used to specify that late data side output is required. This is more general than putting it into the method signature of `apply()` because it will simply work for all different window types.\r\n\r\nI quickly talked to @StephanEwen and we agreed that we need to further think about how we want to expose side outputs for user-defined functions. Especially, we have to think about what this addition means for the `split()`/`select()` pattern. I will also do another change where `sideOutputLateData()` is not required but instead will be added when the late-date stream is requested.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280691045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280696611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2756#issuecomment-280696611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2756","id":280696611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDY5NjYxMQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T16:26:02Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T16:26:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I finally merged it!

sideOutputs?\r\n\r\n`window.sideOutput(OutputTag<IN>, Evaluator)`\r\n\r\n`interface Evaluator{ MergedWindows, key, watermark}`\r\n\r\n- Regarding `split` `select`, I think there is a chance of

Every flink job(session or single) can specify a directory storing checkpoint, called `state.backend.fs.checkpointdir`.\r\n2. Different jobs can set same or different directories, which means their checkpoint files can be stored in one same or different directories, with **sub-dir** created with their own job-ids.\r\n3. Jobs can be run by different users, and users has requirement that one could not read chp files written by another user, which will cause information leak.\r\n4. In some condition(which is relatively rare, I think), as @StephanEwen said, users has need to access other users’ chp files for cloning/migrating jobs.\r\n5. The chp files path is like: `hdfs://namenode:port/flink-checkpoints/<job-id>/chk-17/6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8`\r\n\r\n## Solutions \r\n### Solution #1 (would not require changes)\r\n1. Admins control permission of root directory via HDFS ACLs(set it like: user1 can read&write, user2 can only read, …).\r\n2. This has two disadvantages: a) It is a** huge burden for Admins** to set different permissions for large number of users/groups); and b) sub-dirs inherited permissions from root directory, which means **they are basically same**, which make it hard to do fine grained control.\r\n### Solution #2 (this proposal)\r\n1. We don’t care what permission of the root dir is. It can be create while setup or job running, as long as it is available to use.\r\n2. We control every sub-dir created by different jobs(which are submitted by different users, in most cases), and set it to a lower value(like “700”) to prevent it to be read by others.\r\n3. If someone wanna migrate or clone jobs across users(again, this scenario is rare in my view), he should ask admins(normally HDFS admin) to add ACLs(or whatever) for this purpose.\r\n\r\n@StephanEwen @greghogan @gyfora ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280829804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/280830833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3274#issuecomment-280830833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3274","id":280830833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDgzMDgzMw==","user":{"login":"WangTaoTheTonic","id":5276001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzYwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5276001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic","html_url":"https://github.com/WangTaoTheTonic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-18T08:21:45Z","updated_at":"2017-02-18T08:21:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen What do you think about this?
