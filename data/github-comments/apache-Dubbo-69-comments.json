不好意思，我刚看到您的回复，RpcUtils 的单元测试原先就已经有的。\r\njarslink做module隔离的场景，我在另一个项目有使用，只是代码量有点多，如果一定需要，我可以后续补上。\r\n出现ClassNotFoundException的原因是：Service Interface是通过moduleClassLoader加载的，parentClassLoader无法加载到。\r\nService Interface 和 Invocation Interface 的ClassLoader是同一个，在逻辑上可能会更严谨一些。\r\n最后感谢您的Merge。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/420870278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/420870782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/2493#issuecomment-420870782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2493","id":420870782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDg3MDc4Mg==","user":{"login":"lovepoem","id":827112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem","html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-13T03:22:26Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T03:22:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please
