Airflow is really just an \"orchestrator\", mostly telling other systems what to do. It can take on some serious workload since it is a distributed system, but real computation at scale should be shipped off of Airflow to a real computation solution.\n\nAs for Azkaban and Oozie, one of the key difference is a static declarative approach (xml/yaml config files) versus Airflow's dynamic approach to programmatically define pipelines (a DSL). Luigi is also programmatic, but creating a task requires deriving a class as opposed to instantiating it (in Airflow), which makes it somewhat less dynamic. \n\nFrom the Airflow docs: \"When workflows are defined as code, they becomes more dynamic, maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.\"\n\nIf are interested in streaming pipelines in Python, Luigi or Spark Streaming are probably a better solution.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/134502816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/134510198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/305#issuecomment-134510198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/305","id":134510198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDUxMDE5OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-25T07:29:58Z","updated_at":"2015-08-25T07:29:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Seen some tasks that got triggered that shouldn't have been triggered.

This is only an issue because we need to  seamlessly migrate users from pre-alembic Airflow and that means skipping certain steps (for tables they already have).\n\nSo I think the proper way to do this is:\n1. keep the first migration version largely as is, but remove the `is_encrypted` field from `connection` table, and add the `xcom` table. Then this first migration file is basically \"this is what a pre-alembic Airflow user looks like\" and can be full of guards against existing tables.\n2. create a migration version file for adding \"is_encrypted\" that has no guards against it already existing. (or maybe we need one guard for users who have installed Airflow since yesterday)\n3. create any future migration versions without guards...\n\nThis workflow should support existing users AND new users (including `resetdb`) without complication introduced by worrying about guards.

So as I understand, flask-login hook gives me \n1. Authentication and \n2. Access level as you mention.\nWe also need \n3. DAGs filtering based on owner\nSo can be taken up as a potential contribution.\n\nHowever, right now, I am struggling with flask-login. I am a python noob and trying to understand how it works. I copied default_login as airflow_login to pythonpath, and is picked up correctly (also set authenticate=true). However, it results in an infinite loop between \nGET /admin and\nGET /admin/airflow/login?next=/admin\n\nSo is there some minimal modification I can / need to do to the airflow_login.py to make it work?\n\nI was hoping something like a basic authentication popup to show with DEFAULT_USER (i.e. airflow) as valid username, and something (say secret_key?) as password.\n\nI guess going through flask login tutorials available online will probably help, but some immediate suggestions to make it work will allow me to get on board quickly.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/135589822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/135592507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/317#issuecomment-135592507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/317","id":135592507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTU5MjUwNw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T00:38:32Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T00:38:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here's an example of how this can be done.

Generally, dill is not able to unpickle modules.\n\nTo be short, if you want airflow being able to execute specific task on a remote box, you have to put the 'unusual_prefix_...' module on PYTHONPATH. There're two ways you can do that:\n1) Copy all of the $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags directory to remote box, and start task instance with '-sd' argument provided, namely, 'airflow run example_dag .. -sd '. This way, airflow would scan the provided subdir, and import dag modules as 'unusual_prefix_**' names.\n    In this way, we're actually not using the pickling feature of airflow.\n2) Ask the author of dill to add module serializing support.\n    The related issue is [here](https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/123).\n\nhi, @mistercrunch could you please give any hints on this ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/136298412/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/136394746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/332#issuecomment-136394746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/332","id":136394746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjM5NDc0Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-31T14:45:04Z","updated_at":"2015-08-31T14:45:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's from pypi not master is it?
