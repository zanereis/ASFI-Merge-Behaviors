We are targeting to implement WskRest for REST, and Wsk REST entities based on making REST calls to access openwhisk services for tests as well. \r\n\r\nThis piece of work can be designed to implement in the following steps:\r\n1. Make the final result for all the test cases consistent. \r\n-- We use RunResult to save the information from CLI, in terms of exitCode, stdout and stderr. We need to have RestResult to save the information coming back from http response. Http status code can be converted into exitCode (by minus 256 if it is greater than 400, otherwise keep the same), http resposne data can be converted into stdout, http error message can be mapped into stderr if there is error.\r\n\r\n-- Result of activation CliActivation need to be generalized. We need to make it accessible by class in packages, not just an inner class. In addition, we need to give a general name, like ActivationResult. Activation information from http should also be converted into this object. PR: #2592 \r\n\r\n2. Create base Wsk class and base entities for Wsk CLI and REST to extend or create. All the test cases are now using Wsk and Wsk entities of CLI by default. We need to switch to use Base Wsk and Base entities, so that test cases can call the implementation of either Wsk CLI or REST based on different needs. Wsk class and base entities are defined as traits with the methods. Wsk and Wsk entities of CLI and REST need to override the methods with different implementation. PR: #2593 \r\n\r\n3. When the base Wsk class and base entities are in hand, implement Wsk REST and wsk rest entities.\r\n-- Create WskRest framework \r\n-- Add WskRestAction\r\n-- Add WskRestTrigger\r\n-- Add WskRestNamespace\r\n-- Add WskRestRule\r\n-- Add WskRestPackage\r\n-- Add WskRestApi\r\n-- Add WskRestActivation\r\nPR: #2589\r\n\r\n4. Create abstract class for test cases, and create different wsk with either cli or rest. Test result verification may remain the same for most of cases, may need slight changes for some verification. \r\nPR: #2621","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/321317659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/321319503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2430#issuecomment-321319503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2430","id":321319503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTMxOTUwMw==","user":{"login":"houshengbo","id":1542989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1542989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo","html_url":"https://github.com/houshengbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-09T17:09:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T17:09:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@markusthoemmes @rabbah @csantanapr \r\nI have linked the sub-tasks of this piece of work item to the existing PRs.
