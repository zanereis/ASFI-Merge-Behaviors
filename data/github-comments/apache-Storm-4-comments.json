The latter was required so that the test runner triggered<br/>\n    by Maven can tell code (src/jvm/main) and tests (src/jvm/test) apart.</p>\n\n<p>commit 09081b3d2b1da3dcdd3b97b796b8adf56544583a<br/>\nAuthor: Michael G.

Let us assume that, during its half-hour,<br/>\n    the word \"Bieber\" appears <b>more than five times as often</b> as other<br/>\n    highly-ranked words. Then the very <b>last</b> \"Bieber\" report (in which<br/>\n    \"Bieber\" has only appeared for the first minute of the five-minute<br/>\n    window) will still be able to hold a place in the rankings. Objects are<br/>\n    only lowered in the rankings by being outranked, or by <b>appearing again</b><br/>\n    with a lower score.</p>\n\n<p>    <b>With</b> this change, we wipe zeros, and <b>then</b> wipe a slot. This means<br/>\n    that when we wipe the slot containing the last Bieber mentions, we<br/>\n    don't at that moment remove \"Bieber\" from our map. The <b>next</b> report<br/>\n    will include \"Bieber\" with a score of zero, removing \"Bieber\" from the<br/>\n    ranking object downstream.</p>\n\n<p>commit cb5e958745344849a6f4689963c5de08c5bc2386<br/>\nAuthor: Nathan Marz <nathan.marz@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2013-01-22T23:29:05Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge pull request #33 from MichaelBlume/emit-zeros</p>\n\n<p>    Ensure zeros get reported.</p>\n\n<p>commit 78a0a998c29113f6708cabb1f17bb67b0255ac2c<br/>\nAuthor: Nathan Marz <nathan@nathanmarz.com><br/>\nDate:   2013-01-24T07:53:01Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge pull request #32 from trevor/master</p>\n\n<p>    update to storm 0.8.2</p>\n\n<p>commit 2aaada7ff0db344335642eabd0da52751a17717a<br/>\nAuthor: Mike Blume <mike@loggly.com><br/>\nDate:   2013-02-01T20:49:10Z</p>\n\n<p>    fix unit tests to match new behavior</p>\n\n<p>commit 8f8f48c75989ea1af3afeb8c0fe27b51b6080850<br/>\nAuthor: Nathan Marz <nathan@nathanmarz.com><br/>\nDate:   2013-02-18T07:59:37Z</p>\n\n<p>    upgrade to lein 2</p>\n\n<p>commit e57bf89ab11c2ba6fae479133d78cc7471129495<br/>\nAuthor: Nathan Marz <nathan@nathanmarz.com><br/>\nDate:   2013-02-19T04:59:00Z</p>\n\n<p>    Merge pull request #35 from MichaelBlume/fix-tests</p>\n\n<p>    fix unit tests to match new behavior</p>\n\n<p>commit e7b4c09b6859e6b866d8b45b948c7d69b1cc0ceb<br/>\nAuthor: Michael G.

Apparently a separate thread is used by log4j to perform the<br/>\n    logging, whose execution path could interweave with the bolt's own<br/>\n    thread.</p>\n\n<p>    Even though this is not necessarily a deficiency of the Rankings class<br/>\n    (which does not claim to be thread-safe), we still decided to make<br/>\n    Rankings#updateWith() thread-safe so that users do not run into errors<br/>\n    when using log4j & Co. for logging purposes.  In other words, we decided<br/>\n    to add this fix for the convenience of our users.</p>\n\n<p>commit 3b2db7cfa11d9daf6e326202f3909d9d104f95dd<br/>\nAuthor: Michael G.
