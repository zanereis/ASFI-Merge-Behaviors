The situation with AbstractAWSProcessor is a bit odd.  It's deprecated in that you should not derive directly from it, but it still has live code we're definitely using.\n- **Number Parsing Exception Handling** - I tested with a non-double metric value.  A java.lang.NumberFormatException is thrown parsing the number at PutCloudWatchMetric.java:174.  The error message is clear enough, but the exception is not caught inside onTrigger(), so the entire session is rolled back and the flowfile remains in the incoming queue.  The same thing applies to parsing Timestamp.  Shouldn't we catch the exception and route the flowfile to failure in a case like this?\n- **Integration Tests** - Integration tests failed for me, complaining about no flowfiles routed to REL_SUCCESS.  I believe the fix might be as simple as adding an empty flowfile before running:\n  \n  ```\n  runner.enqueue(new byte[] {});\n  runner.run();\n  ```\n- **Unit Tests** - How about some unit tests that do not call AWS?  I agree there is no substitute for integration tests that actually call AWS, but I believe there is also no substitute for unit tests that can easily be run by anyone and everyone.  This can be a bit tricky for cloud services, but it seems like CloudWatch has an API with nice request/response patterns that can be mocked.  So I tried my hand at a [simple mock setup with sample tests for PutCloudWatchMetric](https://github.com/jvwing/nifi/commit/b6ae1accfecb464fe16a456cdef04669a65672fe).  You're welcome to not use this, but I recommend we try something similar that gets coverage of onTrigger from unit tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253334561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253376435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1112#issuecomment-253376435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1112","id":253376435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzM3NjQzNQ==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T00:18:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T00:18:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ktseytlin Thanks for the updates.

The purpose of these adapters is to create human readable values for either a timestamp or for a date-time. The timestamps are typically used to show when something was latest refreshed. Due to the frequency, rendering the date in these scenarios is not necessary. The date-time adapter will additionally include the date and is typically used for items like events.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not super familiar with the OpenAPI spec.

The tests were passing on my end, but maybe something has been broken.\n\nLet me explain the rationale:\n1) Your API should comply with the OpenAPI specs as you're using swagger and date-time (see https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). A datetime looks like this: https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14. Example:       1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z or       1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00. Knowing this, two solutions: either you rename your variable to \"string\" (and then the expectations are set), or if you keep date-time, you need to merge my changes.\n2) Regarding the UI: in my PR, I chosen to have timestamps with zones, meaning the timestamp will be adapted from where the NiFi instance is running (so not UTC). That's a good first step. The second step is to have the UI website format the date it's receiving from the now-valid REST API, and that's probably something we may want to add in this PR, or in a separate one. FYI- I have tested the UI and things aren't broken as far as I can see\n3) For breaking the existing clients: which clients are you talking about?\n\nLooking forward to reading from you\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253793079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253797740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1113#issuecomment-253797740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1113","id":253797740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzc5Nzc0MA==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T13:23:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T13:23:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This works great, thanks again for the contribution! +1 Merging to master\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253797740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253802805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1136#issuecomment-253802805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1136","id":253802805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzgwMjgwNQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T13:45:20Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T13:45:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Our use of swagger is simply for generating the documentation. The swagger.json is generated into the target directory and is not made available as part of the released source or convenience binaries.\n\nI think the issue here is the inability of Swagger to understand the use of JAXB adapters. These values are String's already as the adapters support (un)marshalling them. I would guess that Swagger is simply reading the type of the property as a `java.util.Date` and marking it a date-time.\n\nI would suggest we update the `ApiModelProperty` annotation of all fields that use any JAXB adapters to accurately reflect the actual data type a client can expect. It looks like there is a dataType field in the annotation.

What your suggesting is changing the meaning of those fields. They are strings that are meant to be human-readable (one with the time and the other with the date and time). If we change them, we could be affecting any existing clients of that API that expect them to be human-readable strings. The clients I'm referring is anyone consuming this API in an existing version of NiFi. As you mentioned, in our case we would need to update the UI (which is a client of this API) to reformat it as necessary. This is not something we would expect others to do in a minor/incremental version change or without somehow versioning the API.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I believe that any field using a JAXB adapter is currently being interpreted incorrectly by Swagger. While it would be nice if Swagger could correctly determine the actual data type (a string in this case and not a date-time) it appears they at least provide a mechanism for setting it explicitly.

have a few more comments from running the processor and reviewing the code:\n\n**Processor Annotations**\n- The CapabilityDescription says this processor transfers one flowfile for each sheet in the Excel document, but that was not my experience.  It aggregated all content into one output flowfile.  Is that the intended behavior?\n- Most NiFi attribute names are lowercase, \"sheetname\" or \"sheet.name\" instead of \"SheetName\".  I don't believe there is a hard and fast rule there, but I recommend going lowercase if you do not have a strong preference.\n\n**Properties**\n- PropertyDescriptors should have `name` as a machine readable key like \"extract-sheets\" and `displayName` for the user \"Sheets to Extract\".\n\n**Exception Handling and Logging**\nMost NiFi components use `getLogger().error(...` as you do later in the code, rather than `printStackTrace()`.  I haven't tested these error cases, but they appear to be informational rather than stopping or failing the flow.  Would `getLogger().info(...` or `getLogger().debug(...` be a better fit here?  Do users need the full stack trace, or would just the message be helpful enough?\n\n```\n} catch (InvalidFormatException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} catch (OpenXML4JException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n} catch (SAXException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/254628033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/254628153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1070#issuecomment-254628153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1070","id":254628153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDYyODE1Mw==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T20:23:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T20:23:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@scottyaslan This addresses the issue in the property table used throughout the canvas, however the same problem exists in the UpdateAttribute Custom UI.
