Instead we should try to retrieve the entity names from the database using a view that sorts for us. The type of sort should be controllable via a flag passed to the REST interface. \r\n\r\nWe can sort the entity names in the CLI as shown below. However, when the `--limit` or `--skip` flags are specified, an unexpected list is returned. From the example below, a user would expect to see the entities `9992` and `aaaaaaa` when using a `--limit` with an argument of 2. This is not the case in the example below because `NoSQL DB-em_Credentials-1` and `cloudant_Credentials-1` are returned from the server since the backend sorts entities by creation date.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwsk package list\r\npackages\r\n/namespace/9992                                           private\r\n/namespace/aaaaaaa                                        private\r\n/namespace/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa private\r\n/namespace/asdfasdfasdfasedf2                             private\r\n/namespace/cloudant_Credentials-1                         private\r\n/namespace/NoSQL DB-6v_Credentials-1                      private\r\n/namespace/NoSQL DB-em_Credentials-1                      private\r\n/namespace/Hub-ju_Credentials-1                           private\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wsk package list --limit 2\r\npackages\r\n/namespace/cloudant_Credentials-1                         private\r\n/namespace/NoSQL DB-em_Credentials-1                      private\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/315462305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/315473242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1569#issuecomment-315473242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1569","id":315473242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTQ3MzI0Mg==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T21:33:24Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T21:33:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> we've determined that the CLI should not be responsible for sorting entity names.

- with regard to @mdeuser 's suggestion for getting unions of annotated and default parameters: listing the union of these parameters can be kind of confusing all at once without at least differentiating the bound from the annotated parameters. For example:  \r\n```\r\npackage /whisk.system/cloudant: Cloudant database service\r\n   (parameters: bluemixServiceName, dbname, host, password, username, apihost, overwrite)\r\n```\r\nWhich ones do I actually have access to? Which are/aren't important? I thought about something like:\r\n```\r\npackage /whisk.system/cloudant: Cloudant database service\r\n   (parameters: *bluemixServiceName, *dbname, *host, *password, *username, apihost, overwrite)\r\n```\r\nwhere parameters with * are bound, and if they were finalized they could have a different prefix.
