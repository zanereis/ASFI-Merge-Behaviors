There is no failure. An empty commit that does not delete in data.

It is a great enhancement for bucket index.\r\n> \r\n> On high-level, could we use the current BucketIndex abstraction to unify the implementation of different BucketIndexEngines? Also, the dedicated Partitioner (i.e., SparkRangeBucketIndexPartitioner) may not be necessary, as long as we tag the file id during indexing (checkout consistent hashing which uses default Partitioner).\r\n\r\n     Right now, rangBucketIndex generate file like \"00000009-0_2-12-29_20220924180225595.parquet\", and it doesn't contain any UUID element,  I think it's ok, am I right?\r\n     By this clue, if simpleBucketIndex also act like this, SparkBucketIndexPartitioner may not be necessary eigther? and if use default partitioner， it can reduce a lot of empty spark-task。\r\n@YuweiXiao

But I think the benefit is saving the metadata loading overhead (i.e., listing to get the filename) rather than the one you mentioned. With the default partitioner, it should not be empty partition (`UpsertPartitioner`). Please correct me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\nAlso, we better to follow the naming convention of the file group, in case of potential compatibility problems.

But I think the benefit is saving the metadata loading overhead (i.e., listing to get the filename) rather than the one you mentioned. With the default partitioner, it should not be empty partition (`UpsertPartitioner`). Please correct me if I am wrong.\r\n> \r\n> Also, we better to follow the naming convention of the file group, in case of potential compatibility problems.\r\n\r\nyes，every empty bucket will access metadata in ‘getBucketInfo’，when partitionNum * bucketNum is very big，it‘s a heary overhead for metadata （and spark driver scheduler don't like it eigther）。\r\nMore important！I'am afraid that we can't follow ‘uuid naming convention’， because this name is genarated in rdd task one by one record but not a one by one bucket  like simpleBucketIndex rigtht now\r\n@YuweiXiao \r\n\r\n@danny0405 please help look at this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1257144913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1257172243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6788#issuecomment-1257172243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6788","id":1257172243,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5K7u0T","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-25T11:24:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T11:24:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@YannByron
