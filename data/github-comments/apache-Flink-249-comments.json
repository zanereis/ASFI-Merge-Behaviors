In a nutshell, time timer service can just register and operate on those states, where the basic operations that we expose are somewhat along the lines of `scheduleTimer`, `stopTimer`, `peekNextTimer`, `pollNextTimer`. I am currently working on a small design document to outline this integration. For RocksDB we can have an implementation of the state can be loosely based on some of the ideas from the class `RocksDBTimerHeap` of PR #3359.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/391985372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/391989009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6062#issuecomment-391989009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6062","id":391989009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTk4OTAwOQ==","user":{"login":"sihuazhou","id":7480427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7480427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sihuazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-25T08:59:16Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T08:59:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StefanRRichter Thanks for your reply, I think I should also have a look at https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3359 to supplement my knowledge on this.

It may be useful to suggest turning off task chaining for debugging.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Kafka connector page discusses the fact that the Kafka source only emits watermarks as the minimum of the per partition watermark, which means an idle partition may delay watermark emission.

I agree with @sihuazhou that it's not as easy as replacing `x` with `xAsync`. As @sihuazhou pointed out, we have to react to asynchronous Yarn messages depending on our internal state. So for example, when calling `startContainerAsync` we should store somewhere that we tried to start a container. If this request later fails, we should not fail the complete ResourceManager but rather send a new container request (as it is done in the `YarnResourceManager#onContainersAllocated` method).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while touching this code, we should check whether we can improve the unit tests for this component. Especially with the asynchronous node manager client, it should be rather simple to write good tests when creating a mock implementation and manually calling the callbacks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/393161939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/393165891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5593#issuecomment-393165891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5593","id":393165891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzE2NTg5MQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T13:40:50Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T13:40:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reminder @yanghua.
