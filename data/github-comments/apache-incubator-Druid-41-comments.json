@binlijin thanks for the awesome PR.  A few points and questions:\n1. It looks like there are two points of caching explicitly called out here. https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/1938/files#diff-af29f4b50bb9f1944744fa9a1b3f4df2R1024 and using STRING_STRATEGY at https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/1938/files#diff-4cb77a6cbc8f0534054954700125f6afR367 . If my overall reading is correct the main thing that's going on is that the looking for values is now done in such a way that explicitly uses the cached STRING_STRATEGY. Is that the right way to read this? A summarization for why you changed the aspects would be awesome.\n2.

@drcrallen @himanshug , I want to explain what's purpose of the BitmapIndexSeeker which the main performance boost comes from.\nIn the previous version of index merge, during the creation of invert index, we do something like merge sort of multiply bitmap indexes. It simply iterator all the previous sorted values, and \"binary find\" the id in each bitmap indexes, which involves disk IO and is really slow. Suppose we have N (which is 100 in our test) small segments, each have M (which is 50000 in our case) rows. In high cardinality scenario, we will almost have N \\* M uniq values. So the complexity will be O(N \\* M \\* M \\* LOG(M)).\n\nThere are 2 properties we did not use during the merging:\n1. We always travel the dimension values sequentially\n2. One single dimension value is valid only in one index when cardinality is high enough\nSo we introduced the BitmapIndexSeeker, which can only seek value sequentially and can never seek back. By using this and the help of \"getDimValueLookup\", we only need to translate all dimension value to its ID once, and the translation is done by self-increase of the integer. We only need to change the CACHED value once after previous value is hit, renew the value and increase the ID. The complexity now is O(N \\* M \\* LOG(M)).\n\n There is still a potential optimization though, since we use the Indexed<String> returned by \"getDimValueLookup\" to get the value of the id which may causes some binary search or disk io later. But these costs are small right now. When these costs get higher, we can move the \"seeker\" into the bitmap index, and travel the value sequentially to get the value and id tuple in O(1). By then the complexity will be O(N \\* M).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/155265184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/155274727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1921#issuecomment-155274727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1921","id":155274727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTI3NDcyNw==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T03:40:52Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T03:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen @gianm @himanshug \n\nThe benchmarks were unnecessarily creating a StringInputRowParser, I've revised them to use only the JSONParser/JSONPathParser.\n\nNew benchmark numbers:\n\nBenchmark                                    Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\nFlattenJSONBenchmark.baseline                avgt   50  20.971 ± 2.840  us/op\nFlattenJSONBenchmark.flatten                 avgt   50  36.168 ± 7.699  us/op\nFlattenJSONBenchmark.preflattenNestedParser  avgt   50  19.007 ± 3.677  us/op\n\nbaseline is old JSONParser\nflatten is new JSONPathParser on nested input\npreflatten is new JSONPathParser on preflattened input, same input as baseline\n\nAfter discussing some profiling results with @gianm  today, I added a 4th benchmark that extracts root-level fields with JsonPath (i.e., specify a \"nested\" field but with a root expression).
