JDK8's parallelStream has a global thread pool, we can call this ```thread resource```, all caller could share this thread pool.\r\n```TabletInvertedIndex``` has a lock, we call this ```lock resource```.\r\nIf we add a lock out of thread pool, then dead lock could happen between ```thread resource``` and ```lock resource``` \r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nstep 1 Thread 1  get TabletInvertedIndex's read lock.\r\nstep 2 Other threads calls parallelStream and the thread pool is full.\r\nstep 3 Thread 1 try to submit task to thread pool,  but the it is blocked because the

allocator有进一步的优化思路，欢迎继续提交，thks~👏","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200422888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200439666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/11169#issuecomment-1200439666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/11169","id":1200439666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5HjUFy","user":{"login":"Lchangliang","id":31928846,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTI4ODQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31928846?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang","html_url":"https://github.com/Lchangliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lchangliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-31T14:47:33Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T14:47:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200439666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200561850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/11366#issuecomment-1200561850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/11366","id":1200561850,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Hjx66","user":{"login":"0xez","id":110299556,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpMJpA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110299556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez","html_url":"https://github.com/0xez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0xez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T01:06:38Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T01:06:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Many

The JDK8's parallelStream has a global thread pool, we can call this `thread resource`, all caller could share this thread pool. `TabletInvertedIndex` has a lock, we call this `lock resource`. If we add a lock out of thread pool, then dead lock could happen between `thread resource` and `lock resource` For example,\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> step 1 Thread 1  get TabletInvertedIndex's read lock.\r\n> step 2 Other threads calls parallelStream and the thread pool is full.\r\n> step 3 Thread 1 try to submit task to thread pool,  but the it is blocked because the thread pool is full.\r\n> step 4 Threads in thread pool wants to get TabletInvertedIndex's read lock or write lock, but the lock is held by Thread 1.\r\n> Finally, deal lock between  thread resource  and  lock resource happens.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And there is still a key question is that why readlock could block read lock. We can refer this https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34672421. In short, even in unfair policy, write locks are not always preempted by read locks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom step 1 to step 3, I think we should follow the principle of acquiring locks when exactly needed in concurrent programming, which will be helpful to  avoid many hard-to-recognize deadlock scenarios.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200708441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200718449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/11305#issuecomment-1200718449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/11305","id":1200718449,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5HkYJx","user":{"login":"hf200012","id":820301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/820301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012","html_url":"https://github.com/hf200012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T05:16:42Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T05:16:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > doris support config line_delimiter.\r\n> \r\n> I had done some test , line_delimiter can only use ‘\\n’\r\nsupport line_delimiter\r\nhttps://doris.apache.org/zh-CN/docs/data-operate/import/import-way/stream-load-manual\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200718449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200718974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/11305#issuecomment-1200718974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/11305","id":1200718974,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5HkYR-","user":{"login":"hf200012","id":820301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/820301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012","html_url":"https://github.com/hf200012","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hf200012/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T05:17:35Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T05:17:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Wilson-BT \r\n<img width=\"905\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/820301/182077161-b00d4579-ecad-4321-a238-f5384ce5e929.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1200718974/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
