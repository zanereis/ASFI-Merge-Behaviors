Broker dispatch process:\r\n1. In the test, we will\r\nsettings: broker.MaxUnackMessagesPerConsumer=100 and broker.MaxUnackMessagesPerSubscription=500. \r\nsetup 2 consumer in share mode, and set consumer.receiverQueueSize=100.   Producer enable batching, and set producer.BatchingMaxMessages=2000.\r\nIn `PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers`, we have fixed setting : `MaxReadBatchSize`=100, and `MaxRoundRobinBatchSize`=20;\r\n2. Once a consumer subscribes to a topic, consumer will send a flow request with 100(receiverQueueSize) permits to broker to get messages.\r\n3. By default, broker will read 100(MaxReadBatchSize) entries from ledger and distribute entries to 2 consumers, each consumer is expecting to get 20(MaxRoundRobinBatchSize) entries. \r\n4. Once broker send messages to the first consumer, unacked messages will be 40000(20 * 2000), dispatcher will be blocked, so the dispatcher init available permits is 200(2 * consumer.receiverQueueSize), after send 40000 messages(20 permits) to the first consumer, available permits is 200 - 40000 = -39800. and Dispatcher is set as blocked.\r\n5. Client Consumer start receiving messages, then after received 50 messsages, it reaches threshold (receiverQueueSize,100/2), consumer will send Flow request to the broker again, but now broker.consumer is blocked by un-ack messages, so broker do not send any messages to consumer, and broker.consumer will increase permitsReceivedWhileConsumerBlocked.\r\n6. Since messages received but not acked,  consumer will send a redelivery request, dispatcher should release the flow control, but the logic in the [broker.consumer](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/Consumer.java#L632), consumer will use min(permitsReceivedWhileConsumerBlocked, totalRedelivery) to increase the available permits in the dispatcher.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is here, if totalRedelivery < permitsReceivedWhileConsumerBlocked, consumer is already send flow request, but broker can't release the flow control in time, because remaining flowPermits is too small(received_total - permitsReceivedWhileConsumerBlocked) comparing to permits in broker(-39800) . Dispatcher will be blocked forever.\r\ne.g. \r\nWhen a consumer receive 10000 messages(5 message, batch size is 2000), consumer will send 200 times flow request(50 messages per request), \r\nIf permitsReceivedWhileConsumerBlocked = 9000, at this time consumer redelivery 2000 messages, dispatcher will use 2000 to increase the available permits(at this time, available permits in dispatcher will be -8000). consumer will send the last 1000 messages(<8000) flow request,  so the dispatcher blocked continue.\r\n\r\nThis is the test log:\r\n\r\n[stop-consume-broker.log](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/files/2747607/stop-consume-broker.log)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/453328896/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/453418589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3359#issuecomment-453418589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3359","id":453418589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzQxODU4OQ==","user":{"login":"didasy","id":1462021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1462021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy","html_url":"https://github.com/didasy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/didasy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T08:01:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T08:02:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Turned out I missed this explanation in [this page.](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/latest/clients/go/)\r\n\r\n> Pulsar Go client library is based on the C++ client library.
