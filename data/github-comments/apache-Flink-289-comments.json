Even for integer values, the semantics for upper and lower would fail if you consider negative integers, where the byte sequence for negative values is lexicographically after those of positive values. \r\nYou could say, that we can just have a check that minByteString <= maxByteString, but even there in a general (non-integer) case you could miss elements that you expect to see in between min and max by `Comparable` from the result of the method if it is not aligned with the serialized byte sequence.\r\nI am not in favor of having some new method that looks like a general API enhancement, but then only works for a subset of cases and can fail sementically (not even always with an error) for other cases.\r\nWhat I would suggest instead is thinking about a more lower level api change that generalizes well and can be used as building block to support this use case on top of it.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we could not yet update the RocksDB version, because they had a performance regression in the merge operator, but this should be fixed soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/452237612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/452242624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7312#issuecomment-452242624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7312","id":452242624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjI0MjYyNA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-08T10:04:55Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T10:04:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we can add a new internal field `shouldSetCacheHeaders` (or something like this) and when creating the `StaticFileServerHandler` we set this appropriately in the constructor. `StaticFileServerHandler` is only used in very few places.

@pnowojski I took a look, so from my understanding, the migration that we're trying to perform here is:\r\nSwitch from using the Flink-determined serializer to a custom state serializer for the `NextTransactionalIdHint` class.\r\n\r\nLooking at the `NextTransactionalClass`, I think the `KryoSerializer` will be used to serialize that (it doesn't qualify as a POJO).\r\n\r\nShort answer: as of the current master this isn't possible yet, so the only way to do that is the \"old-school\" way for this specific case.\r\n\r\nLonger answer:\r\nWhile this is theoretically possible with the new state migration feature, the problem is that the `KryoSerializer` has not yet been updated to use the new serializer abstractions that is required to support state schema evolution. Only a few serializers, most notably the `AvroSerializer` had been updated in 1.7.x.\r\n\r\nGood news is, we're planning to fully update all Flink-shipped serializers to use the new abstractions for 1.8.\r\n\r\nSo, while you may only be able to do it the old-school way for now with the current master, things should change by the time we decide to release 1.8.\r\nI suggest that we proceed with the current solution, but open a JIRA ticket to keep this tracked for 1.8.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/452623432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/452627232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7405#issuecomment-452627232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7405","id":452627232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjYyNzIzMg==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-09T09:21:31Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T09:21:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tzulitai.

What will happen in your change if the task is using operator state, union state in particular. In `applyRepartitioner()`,\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/blob/1e2aa8e9f35e7a943a4ed56a47834ee50bab3b47/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/checkpoint/StateAssignmentOperation.java#L636 \r\n\r\nyou can see that all operator state is repartitioned if there is one union state. this can already be a problem with a union state, but even more if there is a union state and some partionable state -  the partitioning for the partitionable state for those tasks that are restarted could differ to the partitioning used in the original run - some partitions could be dropped or assigned twice by this. I think that means we need to change the method to only redistribute the union states, and I wonder if even distributioing the union state only for the failed task even makes sense. I think we need a testcase for this scenario (operator with 1 union and 1 partionable operator state)and I think it might fail as described before when we check how the operator state was reassigned after some partial recovery.

However, it is not aligned with the version format of the flink-shaded artifacts which seems a bit odd.\r\n\r\nThis version scheme is more similar to flink-shaded than using a `classifier` is. Every flink-shaded artifact (except flink-shaded _itself_) uses a composite version scheme consisting of  `<shaded-version>-<dependency-version>`.\r\n\r\nAs for hadoop 3, shaded-hadoop2 would simply not be used for that. It remains to be seen, but I believe it to be unlikely that we can find a reasonable setup that can cover both versions in 1 module.\r\nThis would also break existing flink-shaded conventions of encoding the dependency's major version in the shading pattern and name of the module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/453043597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/453052056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7449#issuecomment-453052056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7449","id":453052056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzA1MjA1Ng==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-10T10:46:03Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T10:48:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @leesf .
