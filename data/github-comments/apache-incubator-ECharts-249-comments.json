For different currencies, there are time frames for them to compare upon.\r\n\r\nWhy is it needed to adjust the interval distance?\r\n\r\nBecause if same group of currencies are nearer.

am not sure about the config `edgeMargin`. It seams define the gap between \"a pie chart\" and the dom container.
