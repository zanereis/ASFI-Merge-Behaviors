When caching is enabled only the first load will be slow (=fetch the data from the source), and subsequent dashboard views will get its data from the cache (usually sub-second load times). The cache can be warmed up automatically to make sure that even the first load is quick (not sure if it's comprehensively documented, though). However, there is a known bug affecting caching of Filterboxes, so that might be causing slowness.
