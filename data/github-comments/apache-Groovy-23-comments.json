The JIRA issue focuses on a side effect that is caused by calling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatcher as Boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsually you don't expect that casting an object to some other type causes internal changes in the casting object. I agree that using `==~` operator is easier and safer to use, and this is what the guy who asked question on Stack Overflow eventually did. However, the question is still open - should `Matcher.asBoolean()` change the internal state of the object? It shouldn't in my opinion, and that is why this pull request was created. But it's up to you to decide if this makes sense or not.
