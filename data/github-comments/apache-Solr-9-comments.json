So we silently fall-back `text/html` content-type to `text/plain` and only accept well-known content types.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that the Admin UI always attaches `;charset=utf-8` to the contentType param, and we did not accommodate for that, also I did not test the UI manually (stupid). This PR fixes this by checking the raw content-type, including lowercasing and we also accept `text/xml`.\r\n\r\nIt works well in 9.0 Admin UI for the files that I tested. The only thing that I see could still break is if a config-set contains some file that the Admin UI decides to request with an unknown content-type, then the 400 error would not be handled gracefully and result in the red error box on top with no message (that's another bug I think, that the error from the request is not rendered in the UI). But what I can see from [files.js](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/main/solr/webapp/web/js/angular/controllers/files.js), it will not happen, as the UI only handles xml, html, js, json and css explicitly, and everything else requests `text/plain`. Perhaps the UI should map html to `text/plain` here since that is what will happen on the backend anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/971721914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/971732727","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/418#issuecomment-971732727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/418","id":971732727,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM4563b3","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T16:14:08Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T16:14:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tested with 8.10, and put a css file in the config-set.
