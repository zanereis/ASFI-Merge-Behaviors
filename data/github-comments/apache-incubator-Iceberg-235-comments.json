If the parallelism is 100 or 1,000, there will be a lot of collisions and retries. The conditional commit can ensure the correctness. But it can be inefficient or infeasible with high parallelism. Flink Iceberg sink coalescing all data files to a single committer task so that there is only one committer thread (in a Flink job) committing to the iceberg table.\r\n\r\nI fully agree with you on all the points you've stated here. \r\nIf the parallelism is high, conditional commits will be extremely inefficient to the point of infeasible even though it guarantees \"correctness.\"\r\nIn general, it is best to have just a single thread committing updates to an iceberg table, which is what Flink Iceberg Sink does.\r\nThis is also exactly what we try to do in our custom system. \r\nOur issue however is that we cannot guarantee that there will **always** be exactly a single thread committing a given datafile to the iceberg table. \r\nIn **_rare_** situations, and for only a **_brief_** moment in time, there may be more than one thread attempting to commit **_the same set of datafiles_** to the same iceberg table **_at the same time_**. \r\nDue to the distributed nature of our datafile-committer application, it is impossible to completely avoid this type of situation ever happening, we can only make them rare. \r\nThis is where we want to use conditional commits as a last line of defence to ensure that only one of these threads is successful in committing the datafile during these rare and brief moments of instability. \r\n\r\nI hope this explanation clarifies why conditional commits is still useful for datafile-committer use-cases like ours where you can guarantee that the majority of the time there will not be any conflicts. \r\n\r\n> if we go with the conditional commit approach and fail the second commit with lower watermark, how would the second application handle the failure? we can also get into the situation where the second application may never able to commit. if it's watermark is forever behind the first application, the condition check will always be false. not sure if this is a desirable behavior.\r\n\r\nThe desired behaviour here will likely vary depending on the use-case. \r\nFor example, for our use-case, the second application which is hit with a failure would abandon trying to commit that set of datafiles and move on to the next set of datafiles. \r\nDue to the nature of our application, we're guaranteed to eventually (and quickly) converge to a stable condition where each instance will be left handling messages that cannot conflict. \r\n\r\nAs far as the iceberg library is concerned, IMO it should just provide the fundamental building block i.e. a way for iceberg-api users to express the conditions under which a commit should proceed, and leave how to handle failures up to the API users.

First I would refactor the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/35692a360ffd2d1b9107ec6018f9fd97fda04671/python/pyiceberg/io/pyarrow.py#L484-L519\r\n\r\nBy removing the `pq` package from there, and read in a PyArrow fragment instead:\r\n```python\r\nimport pyarrow.dataset as ds\r\nfrom pyarrow.fs import S3FileSystem\r\n\r\nwith fs.open_input_file(path) as fout:\r\n    # First get the fragment\r\n    fragment = parquet_format.make_fragment(fout, None)\r\n    print(f\"Schema: {fragment.physical_schema}\")\r\n    arrow_table = ds.Scanner.from_fragment(\r\n        fragment=fragment,\r\n        ... # add other arguments as well\r\n    ).to_table()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to add logic to decide the `Format` based on the extension of the file, we can read in different fragments:\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.ParquetFileFormat.html\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.dataset.OrcFileFormat.html\r\n\r\nThe fragment has this option to say `physicial_schema` that will return the schema in PyArrow.\r\n\r\nNote: For Parquet we actually fetch the Iceberg schema in JSON format from the metadata currently. https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6505 Will provide the logic to convert a PyArrow schema into an Iceberg schema.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1451550761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1451566878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6978#issuecomment-1451566878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6978","id":1451566878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WhSce","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-02T09:33:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T13:57:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

@nastra really appreciate you taking the time to take a look at this PR. I was a bit confused at first, and it took some time to identify the issue and relate it to schema evolution, so here's an attempt at clearing up any confusion one might have when taking a look at this issue...\r\n\r\nFirstly, my understanding is that the concept of snapshot_id is consistent between the actual iceberg table, and its corresponding state of its metadata tables that represent it at a certain point in time. Time travel on metadata tables based on the snapshot_id is actually an advertised feature of Iceberg within its [docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/spark-queries/#time-travel-with-metadata-tables).\r\n\r\nYour observation that the schema of the filesTable didn't evolve and that that's the cause of the issue is absolutely correct. But I want to make a distinction between the schema_id of the actual iceberg table, the metadata table and their consistent snapshot_ids. Here's a table describing the timeline of events that is described by my test:\r\n\r\n| event                  | create table | add row (id, data) | add column, add row (id, data, data2) |\r\n|------------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|\r\n| snapshot id (random)   | 6234         | 9023               | 8234                                  |\r\n| actual table schema id | 0            | 0                  | 1                                     |\r\n| files table schema id  | 0            | 0                  | 0                                     |\r\n\r\nThe schema ID of the actual table does not change until there is schema evolution. And this is consistent with @szehon-ho 's observation that there is no issue when you try to run time travel queries on the metadata table when there is no schema evolution, even when you add an extra row and increment the snapshot ID.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the schema evolves in the actual table, because #1508 makes a strong assumption that we are only looking at the schema ID of the actual table, we are using that schema ID to read the files metadata table, instead of using the schema ID of files table at that snapshot. Interesting thing is, that we are still able to query the files table for the first two snapshots in this series of events (6234 and 9023) even after the table has evolved, because the schema IDs within that snapshot are consistent across it's actual table and its metadata tables.\r\ni.e. this issue happens on snapshots where the _schema id of the actual table_ diverges from the _schema id of the files table_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1451946473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1451962697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6978#issuecomment-1451962697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6978","id":1451962697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WizFJ","user":{"login":"sungwy","id":107272191,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmTX_w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107272191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy","html_url":"https://github.com/sungwy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sungwy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-02T14:33:05Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T15:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have a couple of thoughts around what the \"correct\" fix would be for this issue... as @szehon-ho mentioned on PR #6980 it would absolutely be nice for us to be able to support looking up metadata tables using their corresponding snapshot's schema as well. \r\n\r\nFor additional context, the ability to read data using the snapshot's schema was introduced in 0.13.0 Release, which allowed users to view the actual table using the schema of the table in that point in time. This wasn't a feature that was supported for actual tables or metadata tables before. Also, the metadata table's schema can only be updated if a user operates on a specific iceberg table across multiple versions of iceberg jar. This can happen, but only happens with a clear intention to increment the infrastructure stack in a data pipeline, instead of a running pipeline consistently and passively invoking schema evolution on the table.\r\n\r\nSince this is a feature regression, I think it would be very important to put in a fix to at least make the metadata table readable upon schema evolution of the actual table by conditionally using the `icebergTable.schema()` if the table is an `instanceof BaseMetadataTable`. This will at least fix this bug and revert metadata table time travel to a useable state. And then, we can continue to look into the proper way to introduce the concept of snapshot-schema based time travel for metadata tables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1451962697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1452082339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6982#issuecomment-1452082339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6982","id":1452082339,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WjQSj","user":{"login":"ajantha-bhat","id":5889404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat","html_url":"https://github.com/ajantha-bhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajantha-bhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-02T15:44:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T15:44:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Discovered

@RussellSpitzer @huaxingao\r\n\r\nIf this functionality is still required and Spark side is still pending, I might try to implement it (as a Scala developer I would really like to have the merge API). \r\n\r\nI just need to have a chat with someone who knows the Scala code base to clarify some missing pieces in my analysis. \r\n\r\nI see two possible implementations, both following the implicit approach.\r\n\r\nOption 1: \r\n* implicits that extends DataSet[T] with a new method mergeTo(table,condition)\r\n* implicits that extends DataFrameWriterV2[T] with the following method:\r\n    * whenMatched(condition:Option[String],actions:Seq[String])\r\n    * whenNotMatched(condition:Option[String],actions:Seq[String])\r\n    * merge() that will calls the final operations\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nds\r\n.mergeTo(table,condition)\r\n.whenMatched(something here)\r\n.whenNotMatched(something here)\r\n.merge()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 2: \r\n* implicits that extends DataFrameWriterV2[T] with the following method:\r\n    * mergeWhen(condition:Option[String]) \r\n    * whenMatched(condition:Option[String],actions:Seq[String])\r\n    * whenNotMatched(condition:Option[String],actions:Seq[String])\r\n    * merge() that will calls the final operations\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nds\r\n.writeTo(table)\r\n.mergeWhen(condition)\r\n.whenMatched(something here)\r\n.whenNotMatched(something here)\r\n.merge()\r\n```\r\nThe difference between the two approaches is in the syntax of the API: on the first one we generate a new 'mergeTo' method, on the other we refer to the already existing 'writeTo'.\r\n\r\nLooking at the actual code base I see that a MergeInto operation has already been resolved in a Spark LogicalPlan, probably we could reuse this logic and just call the executePlan on the final merge call\r\n\r\n
