think this behavior is expected. The reason is, the best timing for Dubbo to count down delay for exposing service is when Spring container is ready, then this timing should be the moment when spring context gets refreshed, since at this moment, all beans are settled, and are ready for wiring in their dependencies. If it happens earlier, say, at the moment after properties set, then Dubbo may fail to expose service because it depends on other spring bean. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Dubbo should start to expose services until spring context gets refreshed, no matter delay or no-delay is configured. Unfortunately in order to keep backward compatibility, considering not all spring versions support context refresh callback, we have to start to expose services after properties set if we find application listener is not supported, and hope Dubbo service can be exposed normally.\r\n\r\nI hope this can clarify the
