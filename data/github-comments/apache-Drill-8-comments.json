It was declined by Calcite's community, and the argument was adding unnecessary duplicates to the code. I think this argument is fair. Otherwise, there might be tens of variants for a single operator.\n\nRegarding adding a new converlet:\nInitially, I though having three wrappers (operator, function, agg function) are sufficient for all scenarios. However, at one method during conversion, the type SqlBetweenOperator is being expected. Thus, I decided to add a new wrapper which extends SqlBetweenOperator, so we do not need to do anything in conversion.\n\nCertainly, we might be able to attain by not adding a new wrapper but adding a new converlet. I would not prefer this approach since \n1. I tried not to spread out the code complexity (introduced by inference and operand type check) to too many places. \n2. Adding our own converlet also introduces code complexity.

So copy the sent email as below:\n\nThanks for pointing to openHFT. Yes, I went through multiple Java implementations including this one. The reason I decided to use smhasher as the source of truth was, the smhasher implementation includes comprehensive tests to cover the attributes for measuring goodness of a non-cryptographic hash function. And these attributes are subtle and could be found out to be a problem maybe only on certain lengths of input. So when I looked at these implementations, I checked what tests they have done first. And since there is no such tests(test multiple attributes and lengths) in these Java implementations to prove the hash functions are correct or good. So I decided to start from smhasher implementations and used the results generated from smhasher to verify any other(including drill's) implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/206578634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/206611168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/468#issuecomment-206611168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/468","id":206611168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjYxMTE2OA==","user":{"login":"jinfengni","id":5742011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDIwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5742011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni","html_url":"https://github.com/jinfengni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T23:05:54Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T23:05:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@amansinha100 , could you please review this PR?

Getting version compatibility working will be a huge benefit to users.\n\nBut, as it turns out, version compatibility is a complex issue. Do we have a design document that explains our goals and policy? Is the goal to allow rolling updates of clients? (Drill server at, say 1.8, rolling upgrade of client from 1.7 to 1.8, old clients work)? Or, is it to allow rolling upgrades of servers? Both?\n\nMapR customers receive even releases: 1.4, 1.6, 1.8. Would the +/-1 policy benefit them?\n\nAs I understand it, each Drill bit is to work with another of +/-1 version. But, what I bring up Drill 1.6, Drill 1.5 and Drill 1.4. The 1.5 is happy to work with both 1.6 and 1.4. But, the 1.6 and 1.4 versions will fail only when they communicate with one another. When will this communication occur? At startup? Or, only later when, say, 1.6 tries to send a query to 1.4?\n\nDoes this mean that Drillbits should advertise their version in ZooKeeper so that we fail fast and can provide a clear error message? (DRILL-4543)\n\nDremio proposes a new 2.0 release that breaks compatibility. Will Drill 1.9 (say) be compatible with the (proposed) incompatile Drill 2.0? Should it be? How should we make that work?\n\nAs others have said, we need to consider wire protocol and semantics. The usual solution is protocol negotiation. If a 1.6 client connects to a 1.7 server, they agree to \"speak\" 1.6. If a 1.7 client connects to a 1.6 server, they also agree to \"speak\" 1.6. Such as solution has impact on our messaging layer. It increases testing requirements. \n\nDrill-on-YARN will provide another way to do server upgrades (ramp up a new cluster while ramping down an old one.) Otherwise, YARN will need some way to run the same cluster, replacing version X drillbits with version X+1 (while still running the version X Application Master).\n\nIf I may suggest, this is a complex topic. This is much more than a code change to compare version numbers. Perhaps we should work out the goals and issues in a design document.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/208943460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/208959253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/474#issuecomment-208959253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/474","id":208959253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODk1OTI1Mw==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T15:20:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T15:20:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some other design issues. The idea of a rollling upgrade presupposes that we can shut down a Drillbit, bring up a new one, and the cluster keeps running. But, today, bringing down a Drillbit causes all in-flight queries on that node to fail. There is no way to mark a node as \"quiescent\" (up, but not accepting new work.) So, a rolling upgrade today would entail a long series of query failures as we replace each of, say, 20 or 50 nodes. So, in fact, it is less disruptive to take the cluster down, push an upgrade, and bring it back up. (See DRILL-4286.)\n\nBack on testing: testing is essential. A feature that allow +/-1 feature compatibility is not helpful unless someone (other than the user) can certify that it works. If the user gets to do the checking, then it is not very helpful: safer just to do a full upgrade.\n\nTo emphasize an earlier point: there are two distinct issues. One is a managed cluster upgrade (the admin can do it with the help of a management tool.) The other are the many Drill clients spread across desktops: that is a classic desktop software upgrade. Some might be on planes, others locked in desks while someone is on vacation. Let's think about how to upgrade JDBC drivers and the like given this reality.\n\nIs the compatiblity policy number or time based? As an admin, can I expect to have a three-month window for upgrades? Or, will it sometimes be one month, others four months, depending on who changes what? Should we have a time-based policy?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/208959253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/209081311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/474#issuecomment-209081311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/474","id":209081311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTA4MTMxMQ==","user":{"login":"jacques-n","id":183350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n","html_url":"https://github.com/jacques-n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacques-n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T20:03:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T20:03:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In general, I'm against version number checking.
