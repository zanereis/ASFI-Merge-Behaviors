to @lindong28 offline. I think there might be a cleaner way to handle the disk exceptions. It looks that what we want to do when disk exception happens is the following:\r\n1. Notify controller there is a disk failure and mark the disk as failed.\r\n2. return an error to whoever sent the request if the failure was triggered by a request.\r\n\r\nI think we can have a util method to do (1) immediately when the disk IO occurs, and bubble up a  KafkaStorageException which is a retriable exception. When the clients received this exception, it will act accordingly. The benefit of doing this is that we don't need to care about the what exact operation was in progress when the disk IO exception occurs. The leader will always be moved to somewhere else and the related operation will be retried if needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/310785873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/310798510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3426#issuecomment-310798510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3426","id":310798510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDc5ODUxMA==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-24T00:09:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-24T00:09:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

There are currently many IO related operations in Kafka whose IOException is either explicitly swallowed or not explicitly handled. I am not sure we should find out all of them and mark the corresponding log directory and replicas as offline in this patch. \r\n\r\nOne reason is that this maybe over engineering and even reduce the availability of Kafka in an unnecessary manner. Given that we are not explicitly shutting down broker after catching those IOException, either most log directory failure will already be caught and trigger `Exit.halt(1)`, or Kafka broker may be working just fine with its current way of handling those IOException. Thus it may not do us much benefit to handle them in a different way. \r\n\r\nIt is also about the efficiency and the priority of work. I agree with you that there exists IOException that we can handle in a better way to improve the quality of JBOD support. But this task seems independent to the features added in this patch. The main goal of this patch is to change the way we handle log directory failure (i.e. those that currently trigger `halt()`) and it has covered most log directory failure (i.e. those that trigger IOException during ProduceRequest, FetchRequest, checkpoint read/write and LogCleaner read/write). On the other hand, what you asked for is what other IOException should be treated as log directory failure. I am wondering if we can do that separately in a follow-up patch after KIP-112 and KIP-113 are implemented. This may help speedup the overall implementation efficiency and reduce the need for rebase by splitting a large patch into smaller ones. Also, by finishing KIP-112 and KIP-113 first, we can deploy the JBOD feature sooner and the experience from its deployment can help us determine whether we need to handle some exception differently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/310817415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/310819693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3411#issuecomment-310819693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3411","id":310819693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDgxOTY5Mw==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-24T06:36:25Z","updated_at":"2017-06-24T06:36:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang @dguy this is ready to go when you get a chance.
