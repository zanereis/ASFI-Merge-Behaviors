comments: \r\n1. The query would read better if it is setup to return a boolean i.e. using `array_upper(..., 2) IS NULL` instead of converting the integer output to bool in Python. \r\n2. My request in #291 for moving this to a separate commit was for the `plpy_mock.py_in` file since that looks like an independent work. This function is minor enough that it can be kept in #291. \r\n3. The unit test for this function isn't really testing anything except the last line in the function. That also becomes moot if comment 1. is accepted. Considering this, I suggest we don't have the unit test for this function (at least not in the form it currently is).
