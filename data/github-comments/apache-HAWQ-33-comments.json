\r\nCode review is ok, I need to do more tests to verify your modification. \r\n\r\nI will @ you if all tests pass (or provide failure massages so that you can fix them), I plan to finish all tests and reply to you in the first half of next week. \r\n\r\nWait some moments, Thanks.

our approach to testing this going to be? Also, the cache should be a separate class IMO since its behavior and data don't really cohere with `SecurityServletFilter`. Something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass UserGroupInformationCache {\r\n  public UserGroupInformation get(SegmentTransactionId session) { /* ... */ }\r\n  public void removeStaleUGIs(long currentTimeMillis)  { /* ... */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis interface assumes we will have some other thread outside this class that periodically calls `removeStaleUGIs` with the current time. We could also have the cache start its own cleanup thread, but then we'd have to `sleep` in our tests to observe the UGIs getting cleaned up, which could make the tests slow and flaky.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/401503574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/401525392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/1376#issuecomment-401525392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/1376","id":401525392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTUyNTM5Mg==","user":{"login":"interma","id":61843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma","html_url":"https://github.com/interma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/interma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-30T08:00:22Z","updated_at":"2018-06-30T08:00:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@superbobry
