for `local-runnable-on-service-tests` and `cluster-runnable-on-service-tests`. They should probably share the same base re-configuration of the `runnable-on-service-tests` execution, setting up deps to scan and exclusions.\n\nThe `cluster-runnable-on-service-tests` run has the complication that it requires credentials that will depend on who is running them, so you'll likely have to provide many options at the commandline, thus the savings of setting up the `--runner=XYZ` is minimal. But I generally like the idea of these both setting up some useful defaults so the mvn user only has to provide the necessary bits.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/235051764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/235051988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/721#issuecomment-235051988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/721","id":235051988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTA1MTk4OA==","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T19:04:55Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T19:04:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

@jkff  Nice idea, but once concern with the approach  is that GBK on Datastore Query is not possible since it cannot be deterministically encoded (It contains a proto Map). Create.of Source should itself be dynamic rebalancable right? Is there a way to avoid the GBK and just oversplit the queries and provide it to Create.of? (without having to split at pipeline construction time)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/235125669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/235127851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/722#issuecomment-235127851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/722","id":235127851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTEyNzg1MQ==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T00:30:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T00:30:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No, you wouldn't use the Query as the key, but as the Value.

Spark can run it's own (Standalone Mode), use YARN or Mesos. According to the latest [survey](http://go.databricks.com/hubfs/DataBricks_Surveys_-_Content/Spark-Survey-2015-Infographic.pdf) by Databricks Standalone is in the lead (48%), with YARN tailing it (40%) while Mesos not too popular.\nI'd vote for Standalone to test the most popular use case while avoiding the additional complexity of maintaining YARN on this cluster.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/235346610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/235349589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/731#issuecomment-235349589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/731","id":235349589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTM0OTU4OQ==","user":{"login":"amitsela","id":4245753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDU3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4245753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela","html_url":"https://github.com/amitsela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T17:51:40Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T17:51:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.
