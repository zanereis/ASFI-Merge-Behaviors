However, what is needed there is in fact explicit async, which is just like distributed training. Instead of using multiple nodes and parameter server, shared model parameters used in a single node is preferred due to large communication overhead.  \r\n\r\nThe way you mentioned could work, just like your version of a3c, however, is it not exactly the same as the paper's mechanism. In that way, fair comparsion and solid replica would be impossible. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I also have my version of a3c using distributed training. Unfortunately I could only use dist_sync to make it work fast enough. If dist_async used in my case, training speed is extremely slow and would take roughly 4 or larger x time than dist_sync. And although dist_sync could achieve comparable result with the paper, dist_async is really the same way as the paper. \r\n\r\nThus a way to share model paremeter in multiprocessing or a way to speed up dist async training in this specical case is both acceptable.  \r\n\r\nMany Thanks.
