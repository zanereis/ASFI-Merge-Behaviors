Added log4j2 properties xml to be able to change the log level printed in the output. Also changed metadata.fetch.timeout.ms to max.block.ms, as kafka 0.9 had deprecated the config. The test output had warnings like</p>\n\n<p>    39890 <span class=\"error\">&#91;main&#93;</span> WARN o.a.k.c.p.KafkaProducer - metadata.fetch.timeout.ms config is deprecated and will be removed soon.
