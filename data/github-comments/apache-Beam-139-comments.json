I think in general, and even closer to BEAM-92, it could look roughly like this then:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoos.apply(BigQueryIO.Write.to(\r\n    (foo, window) -> destination,\r\n    (destination) -> new BigQueryIO.Write.Destination(...table name, schema, other options...),\r\n    (foo) -> new TableRow(...))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEncapsulating properties of a destination table in a POJO is better than representing them as virtual functions.\r\n\r\nThis requires that all of these functions, here represented as lambdas, should statically declare and be able to access side inputs. This could be done by shoehorning it into this BigQueryIO.Write.to() API, or could be done by adding an abstraction like SerializableFunctionWithSideInputs or
