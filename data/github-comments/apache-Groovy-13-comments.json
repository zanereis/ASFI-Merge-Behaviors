am really sorry, for causing so much turmoil.  That patch was not considered\nworthy for a year now and quite honestly: I don't want my name to be associated\nwith a function `apply`, that does not do, what is expected of it\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apply).  \n\nFor me, Groovy naming is odd, since I am no Ruby developer in the first place,\nbut I would consider it the Groovy heritage for picking a name for a function.\nSo `tap` makes no sense to me -- same as e.g. `inject` makes no sense to me\n(`fold`, `reduce` do) -- but if Ruby developers know that term, I am willing\nto learn.\n\nSince to me Kotlin has its influence from Groovy, \"back-porting\" a Kotlin name\n-- that feels absolutely wrong to me -- is not fine with me.  So I'd rather\nclose this ticket now. So one of the proponents for `apply` can do their own\npatch for fame and glory ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/258976485/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/258988863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/174#issuecomment-258988863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/174","id":258988863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODk4ODg2Mw==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T22:49:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T02:31:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Christoph, I was planning on getting more feedback on the name in the mailing list. I was just suggesting `apply` as the holding pattern since there seems to be as much or more acceptance of that name than `doto`.

- merged.\r\n\r\nJust as a general note, Apache encourages projects to not include @author tags in their source code. Apart from reducing maintenance, it is meant to increase the community feeling of ownership of the whole codebase. After all, you can find out who wrote which lines from git, so it isn't a huge loss of information. So, a PR that deleted the authors would have been just as good - we try hard to make sure that anyone who has contributed anything of any consequence is mentioned in the pom - and the two authors in this file are.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we haven't adopted that policy globally yet, just slowly heading in that direction - so I merged your PR, since it is better to not have the

It means all the calls to call() and call(Object) will then go to call(Object[]) instead. The problem with this now is, that call(Object[]) will use a dynamic method call to call the appropriate doCall method, while in the presented cases call() and call(Object) do direct method calls. In other words we would loose a lot of performance here. I also think that part of the problem gets \"covered up\" by now using a different invocation path in the StaticMethodcallWriter. The key element should be isCallOnClosure, as has bee correctly identified.

It is ok for the list (which is synchronized) to remove it's own entries on add.

Running `println org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ClassInfo.size()` from the command line returns ~200, it jumps to ~900 if I run the same command in `GroovyConsole`.  Maybe a value of 200 would be a better threshold setting for `newWeakBundle`.\r\n\r\nThough maybe none of it is needed if `ManagedLinkedList` is changed to a non-blocking CLQ.  I'm just not sure what new problems that might introduce and if the weakly consistent iterator would work ok for the `modifiedExpandos` `ManagedLinkedList` (I suspect it wouldn't be a problem).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/276258298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/276392372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/485#issuecomment-276392372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/485","id":276392372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjM5MjM3Mg==","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T15:21:18Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T15:21:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blackdrag
