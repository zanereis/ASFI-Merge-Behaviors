The most similar situation is in [warpctc-inl.h](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/plugin/warpctc/warpctc-inl.h), and I effectively copied this approach (using `cudaMemcpyAsync`. Is it even correct to use malloc, when the memory needs to be pinned?). This seems very ugly though, and I consider this code provisional. I would really appreciate some advice on how to do this better. It will also be useful for the cuDNN RNN symbol: I want to support optional variable sequence lengths, and run into the same problem. Should there perhaps be an MShadow op that takes a Tensor and copies it into a std::vector of any type?\n- For `SequenceMask`: its easy to add support for a custom masking type. If there is demand for this, I can quickly add it.\n\nAlso, if you have any other comments, would be greatly appreciated!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/248336231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/248359167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/3339#issuecomment-248359167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3339","id":248359167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODM1OTE2Nw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T16:42:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T16:42:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please
