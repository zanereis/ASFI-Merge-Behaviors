We can use it to build a server image or a client image. Or, we can use it to run either a server instance or a client instance by:\r\n\r\n* `docker run -p 6667:6667 -v mydata:/iotdb/data -v mylogs:/iotdb/logs -d iotdb:base /iotdb/bin/start-server.sh`\r\n* `docker run -it iotdb:base /cli/bin/start-client.sh -h <C_IP> -p 6667 -u root -pw root` \r\n\r\nHowever, if we have chance to publish the image to DockerHub, we need open the Entrypoing, I
