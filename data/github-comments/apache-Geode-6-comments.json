We went for consistency with the CMake community on the explicit variable setting. It is however consistent to have the module \"find\" the product by environment variables if X_ROOT is not set.

all,\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry I missed this. I was out of town for a while and somehow the discussion slipped through the cracks when I was catching up.\r\n\r\nThese changes are what I had in mind, but I didn't realize that this would break existing code that was doing a cast. I know adding a generics should be safe, but in this case we're fixing generics that are broken which is why I think we are getting into trouble.\r\n\r\nI did a little messing around. It looks like we might be able to get away with adding generics to Execution. \r\nThe only caveat is that once we add generics to Execution we are stuck with them. There is an existing bug to also add an argument type to the FunctionContext - see GEODE-2217. So I think maybe the thing to do is to add three types parameters to execution. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n *\r\n * @param <IN> The type of the argument passed into the function, if any\r\n * @param <OUT The type of results sent by the function\r\n * @param <AGG> The type of the aggregrated result returned by the ResultCollector\r\n */\r\npublic interface Execution<IN, OUT,AGG> {\r\n  Execution<IN, OUT, AGG> withArgs(IN args);\r\n  ResultCollector<OUT, AGG> execute(...)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? The other option I suppose is to deprecate the Execution class and introduce a new one, or deprecate the execute methods and introduce new ones, but that seems painful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/275289791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/275407018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/199#issuecomment-275407018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/199","id":275407018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTQwNzAxOA==","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-26T14:51:41Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T14:51:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please close this pull request.
