To achieve this feature we need to use `ConstructHijackInter` to replace `ConstructInter` as they can not be coexistence with each other. \r\n\r\nBut to do this we need to change all Plugins' interface methods from `onConstruct` to `beforeConstruct` and `afterConstruct`. I think this extensive changes **should be appraised**. And I will test the `ConstructHijackInter`'s stability first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/483914962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/483920116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1935#issuecomment-483920116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1935","id":483920116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzkyMDExNg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T03:09:36Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T03:09:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we don't need replace, because most people don't need to change argument of construct.
