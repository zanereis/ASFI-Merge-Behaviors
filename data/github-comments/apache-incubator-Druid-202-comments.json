@gaodayue, sorry it took a while to get you feedback on this proposal. I think it looks great. I have some small suggestions:\r\n\r\n- `sqlQueryId` and `sqlQuery/time` look better to me than `sqlId` and `sql/time`. It emphasizes that they are, in fact, queries (just SQL instead of native). I do agree with you that either one of these makes more sense than `query/sql/time`.\r\n- I think it's better to add a method to RequestLogger that accepts a SQL query, instead of creating a new SqlRequestLogger. I think, on balance, it will be nicer for people to get all their logs in one place rather than having to worry about configuring two different things.\r\n- Maybe this is a good opportunity to fix #4826 as well. My thoughts on that are in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/4826#issuecomment-330560830.\r\n- The `sqlQueryId` sounds like a natural choice for implementing a SQL query cancelation API in the future - do you agree?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423006956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423028717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6301#issuecomment-423028717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6301","id":423028717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzAyODcxNw==","user":{"login":"gaodayue","id":1198446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTg0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1198446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue","html_url":"https://github.com/gaodayue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaodayue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-20T03:30:36Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T03:30:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @gianm , thanks for your suggestions.\r\n\r\n> sqlQueryId and sqlQuery/time look better to me than sqlId and sql/time.

I'll also change `X-Druid-SQL-Id` to `X-Druid-SQL-Query-Id`.\r\n\r\n> I think it's better to add a method to RequestLogger that accepts a SQL query, instead of creating a new SqlRequestLogger. I think, on balance, it will be nicer for people to get all their logs in one place rather than having to worry about configuring two different things.\r\n\r\nI think adding a separate `SqlRequestLogger` is more flexible than reusing `RequestLogger`, for example\r\n\r\n- It allows users to enable sql logging while disabling native query logging, which can be useful in cases where only SQL is used.\r\n- It allows users to choose different implementations for SQL and native query logging. For instance, users may want to log sql request to both kafka and files, while only keep native query logs in local files for diagnostic purpose.\r\n\r\n> Maybe this is a good opportunity to fix #4826 as well. My thoughts on that are in #4826 (comment).\r\n\r\nYeah, but I think it's better to address that issue in a separate PR for backport purpose.

Hi @zhaojiandong, this behavior is intentional: Druid always uses UTC, regardless of system time zone. This makes the parsing behavior consistent even if, for example, your Druid machines and Hadoop machines aren't running in the time zone. I think a better way to address #6343 is to add a \"timeZone\" feature to the TimestampSpec object. Then Druid could use that instead of UTC, if a user provides it. What do you think?\r\n\r\nHi @gianm , it's a good idea to add \"timeZone\" feature.  I will pull another request about this feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423390136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423392529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6353#issuecomment-423392529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6353","id":423392529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzM5MjUyOQ==","user":{"login":"panzhongxian","id":11887422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODg3NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11887422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian","html_url":"https://github.com/panzhongxian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panzhongxian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T02:18:41Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T02:19:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\r\n210     @POST\r\n211     @Path(\"/push-events\")\r\n212     @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, SmileMediaTypes.APPLICATION_JACKSON_SMILE})\r\n213     @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, SmileMediaTypes.APPLICATION_JACKSON_SMILE})\r\n214     public Response addAll(\r\n215         InputStream in,\r\n216         @Context final HttpServletRequest req\r\n217     )\r\n\r\n```\r\nI found the answer in `server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/realtime/firehose/EventReceiverFirehoseFactory.java`\r\nSo, non-json is not supported?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423392529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423429631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6359#issuecomment-423429631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6359","id":423429631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzQyOTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"klauszeng","id":18204443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0NDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng","html_url":"https://github.com/klauszeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauszeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T06:38:08Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T06:39:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jon-wei Thanks.

I came up with was this:\r\n\r\nFirstly a new interface to handle reading a file and emitting rows that can be passed to parsers:\r\n```java\r\npublic interface FirehoseReader<T>\r\n{\r\n\tboolean hasNext();\r\n\tT next();\r\n\tvoid close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor our case we implement a `FirehoseReader` that reads sequence files and emits `ByteBuffer` so that any `ByteBufferInputRowParser` implementations can be used with it:\r\n```java\r\npublic class SequenceFileFirehoseReader implements FirehoseReader<ByteBuffer> {\r\n\tprivate Reader reader;\r\n\tprivate Closeable closer;\r\n\r\n\tpublic SequenceFileFirehoseReader(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {\r\n\t\tthis(inputStream, null);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic SequenceFileFirehoseReader(InputStream inputStream, Closeable closer) throws IOException {\r\n\t\tConfiguration config = new Configuration();\r\n\t\tconfig.set(\"io.compression.codecs\", \"io.airlift.compress.snappy.SnappyCodec\");\r\n\t\tFSDataInputStream fsDataInputStream = new FSDataInputStream(inputStream);\r\n\t\tOption isOption = Reader.stream(fsDataInputStream);\r\n\t\tthis.reader = new Reader(config, isOption);\r\n\t\tthis.closer = closer;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic boolean hasNext() {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tWritable ignoreKey = (Writable) reader.getKeyClass().newInstance();\r\n\t\t\treturn reader.next(ignoreKey);\r\n\t\t} catch (IOException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException e) {\r\n\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic ByteBuffer next() {\r\n\t\tBytesWritable value = new BytesWritable();\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\treader.getCurrentValue(value);\r\n\t\t} catch (IOException ignored) {\r\n\t\t\treturn null;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn ByteBuffer.wrap(value.getBytes(), 0, value.getLength());\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void close() {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\treader.close();\r\n\t\t} catch (IOException ignored) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tcloser.close();\r\n\t\t} catch (IOException ignored) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is then coupled with `ReaderIteratingFirehose` which can be returned from `FirehoseFactory.connect()`\r\n```java\r\npublic class ReaderIteratingFirehose<T> implements Firehose {\r\n\tprivate final Iterator<FirehoseReader<T>> readers;\r\n\tprivate final Closeable closer;\r\n\tprivate FirehoseReader<T> reader = null;\r\n\tprivate InputRowParser<T> parser;\r\n\tprivate Iterator<InputRow> rowIterator;\r\n\r\n\tpublic ReaderIteratingFirehose(Iterator<FirehoseReader<T>> readers, InputRowParser<T> parser) {\r\n\t\tthis(readers, parser, null);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic ReaderIteratingFirehose(\r\n\t\tIterator<FirehoseReader<T>> readers,\r\n\t\tInputRowParser<T> parser,\r\n\t\tCloseable closer\r\n\t) {\r\n\t\tthis.readers = readers;\r\n\t\tthis.parser = parser;\r\n\t\tthis.closer = closer;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic boolean hasMore() {\r\n\t\tif (rowIterator != null && rowIterator.hasNext()) {\r\n\t\t\treturn true;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\twhile ((reader == null || !reader.hasNext()) && readers.hasNext()) {\r\n\t\t\treader = getNextReader();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn reader != null && reader.hasNext();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Nullable\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic InputRow nextRow() {\r\n\t\tif (!hasMore()) {\r\n\t\t\tthrow new NoSuchElementException();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// If we don't have any more parsed rows available parse a new batch\r\n\t\tif (rowIterator == null || !rowIterator.hasNext()) {\r\n\t\t\trowIterator = parser.parseBatch(reader.next()).iterator();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn rowIterator.next();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprivate FirehoseReader<T> getNextReader() {\r\n\t\tif (reader != null) {\r\n\t\t\treader.close();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn readers.next();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic Runnable commit() {\r\n\t\treturn Runnables.getNoopRunnable();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void close() throws IOException {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tif (reader != null) {\r\n\t\t\t\treader.close();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t} catch (Throwable t) {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\tif (closer != null) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcloser.close();\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\t\t\tt.addSuppressed(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tthrow t;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif (closer != null) {\r\n\t\t\tcloser.close();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor example to use it with the `SequenceFileFirehoseReader` above:\r\n```java\r\n\t\treturn ReaderIteratingFirehose<ByteBuffer>(\r\n\t\t\tobject : Iterator<SequenceFileFirehoseReader> {\r\n\t\t\t\toverride fun hasNext(): Boolean {\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn fetcher.hasNext()\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\toverride fun next(): SequenceFileFirehoseReader {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif (!hasNext()) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow NoSuchElementException()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tval openedObject = fetcher.next()\r\n\t\t\t\t\tval stream: InputStream\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstream = wrapObjectStream(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\topenedObject,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\topenObjectStream(openedObject)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} catch (e: IOException) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow RuntimeException(e)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn SequenceFileFirehoseReader(stream)\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tparser\r\n\t\t)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is still a lot of work to be done though. Beyond fixing up `StringInputRowParser` the prefetching and file caching firehose stuff would need to be refactored etc.\r\n\r\nI *should* have some more bandwith for this soon and any mentoring/advice on how to deal with the `StringInputRowParser` situation would be greatly appreciated as we would like to get this work upstream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423473524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/423523025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5584#issuecomment-423523025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5584","id":423523025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzUyMzAyNQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T13:01:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T13:01:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @josephglanville - what have been the toughest issues you faced with StringInputRowParser so far?
