now presto does not support reading TIMESTAMP_MICROS type. This needs to be fixed from the presto side for which I am working on a fix. ( presto only supports timestamp upto millisecond granularity so the fix will simply convert the microsecond to millisecond ) I think `spark.sql.parquet.outputTimestampType` is not working because hudi is using spark's [SchemaConvertors](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/external/avro/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/avro/SchemaConverters.scala#L150) which is not even looking at this option. This might be because that property was to control the parquet type but hudi uses avro format to store the schema of the file within parquet.\r\nIt would be very difficult to change this from the hudi or spark side. Right now the easiest option is to choose the double type as mentioned above till the fix merges to presto. I will share the PR link here in couple days ( I need to refactor it since the presto version is custom internal version )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/669845428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/669866341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1913#issuecomment-669866341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1913","id":669866341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTg2NjM0MQ==","user":{"login":"Ares-W","id":12905032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTA1MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12905032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W","html_url":"https://github.com/Ares-W","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ares-W/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T11:15:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T11:15:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Maybe https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-783 cause this exception.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/669866341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/669960354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1848#issuecomment-669960354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1848","id":669960354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTk2MDM1NA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T14:24:46Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T14:24:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 66.614 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.hudi.functional.TestCOWDataSource\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.hudi.functional.TestCOWDataSource.testStructuredStreaming  Time elapsed: 25.766 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: Boxed Error\r\nCaused by: org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <2> but was: <3>\r\n```\r\n\r\n@garyli1019 this is failing now.

up with @bvaradar  on the diff. Here are some changes/conclusions we narrowed down after our discussion. \r\n- We felt exposing TimedWaitOnAppearCG to external users may not make much sense. We do not want to make TimedWaitOnAppear as the global consistency guard in all places, but it is very specific to finalizeWrite code path. \r\n- And so, instead of defining a config for consistencyGuardClass, we will introduce a config in ConsistencyGuard (for lack of better word, lets say \"simplifyFailSafeConsistencyToTimedSleep/simplifyFailSafeConsistencyToTimedWait\" for now). Will enable this config by default in which case TimedWaitOnAppearCG will be used in finalize Write. If users wish to use FailSafeCG even in finalizeWrite code paths, they can disable this config value on which FailSafeCG will be used.
