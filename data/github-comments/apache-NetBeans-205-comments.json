There are 3 possible cases with different versions / states of GraalVM.\r\n\r\nEasiest: GraalVM **for JDK 21** or generally GraalVM JDKs of internal version greater (I hope) or equal to **23.1.0** -- these *do not contain* org.graalvm.sdk module at all, so Polyglot class API and truffle API is not available on the bootclassspath. No `gu` is provided to install optional components, so the user cannot change JDK state/configuration. Good. Nothing messes/mixes with our distributed libraries, so **GraalVM for JDK21, for JDK22* and any non-Graal JDK is OK. \r\n\r\nNow GraalVM for JDK17, *without* JS installed. I did a bad job validating my changes. Because this combination fails:\r\n```\r\nAllowed engines: GraalVM:js,Graal.js,Nashorn\r\nFound engines:\r\n  freemarker\r\n  NetBeans indentation\r\nWill not resolve proxy configuration.\r\n```\r\nThe GraalVM does not contain `javascript` implementation, but **does contain** Polyglot and Truffle classes. So provided that [`OpenIDE-Module-Hide-Classpath-Packages` was removed](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7248/commits/112fa4b83fe5f6e4bf0e98a6c53b77da8e8195df) - NetBeans will load the JDK-provided infrastructure for its libs.graalsdk `EngineProvider` impl. Those JDK classes do not care at all about that NetBeans provide some language implementation. JDK-provided Polyglot reports \"no javascript\", so there's none.\r\n\r\nThird option, GraalVM for JDK17 (better: JDK with polyglot API) *and js installed in it*: things are fine - Jbecause JDK-provided JS implementation is loaded. Although that wasn't the exactly for why `libs.graalsdk` was implemented for: there once was `libs.graalsdk.system` that aimed to load strictly classes from the JDK, if there was any Polyglot available on bootstrap path. But - the test works, so OK.\r\n\r\nWhy the tests for `libs.graaljs` fail ? That's because they specifically test that that provided Javascript implementation is OK. It wasn't developet to test \"just random\" javascript implementation, picked from the environment, but the bundled one.  The testsuite tries hard to load NetBeans classes, despite (feared)  JDK-provided Polyglot API classes present in tests' JVM. So it loads the Polyglot API from the NetBeans. This is where the `Hide-Packages` removal steps in : it will nicely load NB-distributed Polyglot API (because of special classloader is used) ... but when Polyglot itself attempts to use SerivceLoader classes to its own Truffle implementation by name ... it is loaded from the JDK. And all weird stuff like interface mismatches, version mismatches etc happen. Note: I need some more debugging to understand how **precisely** ServiceLoader escaped from NB context-class-loader here.\r\n\r\nSo one way is to fix the test. It can run without the classloading wrapper on non-polyglot GraalVM _and_ on Polyglot + JS enabled GraalVM. It will not succeed on Polyglot JDK without JS as JS won't be enumerated by JDK. This also means that NB will not be able to bring its JS implementation working on Polyglot JDK without JS installed in it (= GraalVM for JDK17 and older GraalVMs, like 22.3 /JDK17).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2049845681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2050021355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7260#issuecomment-2050021355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7260","id":2050021355,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M56MNfr","user":{"login":"grelf-net","id":38698437,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Njk4NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38698437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net","html_url":"https://github.com/grelf-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grelf-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T15:57:09Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T15:57:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry - it did NOT work correctly in NB 18.

From the diff, I can see that `org.graalvm.nativeimage.RuntimeOptions$OptionClass` has been removed; and then `AbstractPolyglotImpl` substantially changed. This second one is actually used in `libs.truffle`, that delivers its `TrufflePolyglotImpl`, which was and is a separate library in this case.  Sadly we do not have a way how to separate APIs from SPIs -- especially if as in here, the 3rd party's `impl` package mixes SPIs and real implementations.\r\n\r\nThe AbstractPolyglotImpl change seems farily\"local\" to graalsdk-truffle combo. Can you advise how to reliably list all removed/changed things ?
