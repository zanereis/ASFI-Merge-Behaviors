@pwendell,\n\nFirst, thanks for taking the time to look into this.\n\nWhile it's true that this change mixes a few arguably unrelated things, I'm a little worried about breaking it up further. Mainly because github's pull request feature doesn't seem to handle incremental changes well (see my previous comment, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/718#issuecomment-45023292). If there's a way I'm not aware of that allows me to send multiple, related PRs through github, I'll gladly make the changes. Otherwise, I'd rather keep this PR as is since I already have more work that depends on it, and breaking it down would just slow down the whole process even more.\n\nAbout (3), note that one of the goals of the enhancements, as I mentioned in the Jira issue, is to prepare the field for SPARK-1537. Also, the refactoring allows for easier unit testing (which I added as part of my related change mentioned in my above comment). I'm not worried about having to change the interface later - these are internal APIs, after all. But I really would like to have the UI handling separate from the history backend.\n\nAbout (4), the main thing is to allow arbitrary options to be set more easily. I'm not wedded to the idea of a new command line argument (see other comments), but I think we should at least add support for reading config files (not just in the History Server, but also other daemons). I think that more closely matches how people generally deploy daemons.\n\nOn a side note, just in case github doesn't support the \"related PRs\" thing I tried to explain, I'd suggest you guys take a look at something like ReviewBoard. RB makes that pretty painless, since it's not necessarily tied to github branches. It also handles things like renaming files more cleanly (when tied to a git repo). It would probably make merging changes a little more difficult, but I'm sure that could be made better with some scripts. In any case, I'm really looking for suggestions about how to handle these related PRs - sending them one at a time and having to wait until they are committed before sending the next one really slows things considerably, and prevents people from seeing the \"big picture\" when work spans several changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45123904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45124529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/969#issuecomment-45124529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/969","id":45124529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTI0NTI5","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T17:41:55Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T17:41:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please provide more description or problem and how to reproduce and open a jira.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45124529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45124672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/955#issuecomment-45124672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/955","id":45124672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTI0Njcy","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T17:43:13Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T17:43:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mengxr Get you.

For windowed DStream for example, only those matching window sliding period will be valid times and those not matching will be ignored. \nBut ReceiverInputDStream.receivedBlockInfo is updated only when \"compute\" is called.\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/streaming/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/dstream/ReceiverInputDStream.scala#L67\nThus, receivedBlockInfo may have missing times when window DStream is used.\n\nNext, after graph.generateJobs, JobGenerator calls every getReceiverInputStreams getReceivedBlockInfo(). It does not check, is the time valid or not. And \n@pwendell could you please advise, if the way I've fixed the bug is the right one, or it is better to check DStream.isTimeValid before calling receiver input stream's getReceivedBlockInfo?\n\nAnd btw, here is full stacktrace of the exception:\n\n```\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: 1401754908000 ms\n    at scala.collection.MapLike$class.default(MapLike.scala:228)\n    at scala.collection.AbstractMap.default(Map.scala:58)\n    at scala.collection.mutable.HashMap.apply(HashMap.scala:64)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.ReceiverInputDStream.getReceivedBlockInfo(ReceiverInputDStream.scala:77)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator$$anonfun$3.apply(JobGenerator.scala:225)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator$$anonfun$3.apply(JobGenerator.scala:223)\n    at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:244)\n    at scala.collection.TraversableLike$$anonfun$map$1.apply(TraversableLike.scala:244)\n    at scala.collection.IndexedSeqOptimized$class.foreach(IndexedSeqOptimized.scala:33)\n    at scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.foreach(ArrayOps.scala:108)\n    at scala.collection.TraversableLike$class.map(TraversableLike.scala:244)\n    at scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.map(ArrayOps.scala:108)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator.generateJobs(JobGenerator.scala:223)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator.org$apache$spark$streaming$scheduler$JobGenerator$$processEvent(JobGenerator.scala:165)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator$$anonfun$start$1$$anon$1$$anonfun$receive$1.applyOrElse(JobGenerator.scala:76)\n    at akka.actor.ActorCell.receiveMessage(ActorCell.scala:498)\n    at akka.actor.ActorCell.invoke(ActorCell.scala:456)\n    at akka.dispatch.Mailbox.processMailbox(Mailbox.scala:237)\n    at akka.dispatch.Mailbox.run(Mailbox.scala:219)\n    at akka.dispatch.ForkJoinExecutorConfigurator$AkkaForkJoinTask.exec(AbstractDispatcher.scala:386)\n    at scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinTask.doExec(ForkJoinTask.java:260)\n    at scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool$WorkQueue.runTask(ForkJoinPool.java:1339)\n    at scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool.runWorker(ForkJoinPool.java:1979)\n    at scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:107)\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45125185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45125352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/969#issuecomment-45125352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/969","id":45125352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTI1MzUy","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T17:48:55Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T17:48:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

- we can keep the changes together. I think the test-ability argument is a good one for abstracting away the interface. We typically try not to add interfaces until we have two concrete implementations... but again, for internal code it's not a big deal since we can always refactor it later.\n\nRe: reviewboard, we have a bunch of project automation around github, but it's possible reveiwboard could augment this somehow (not sure). Would be interesting to look into. There is no way to do an incremental diff in github, which is indeed super annoying, however in the past that feature hasn't been seen as outweighing the other benefits.

You can achieve both previously available use cases with spark-submit arguments:\n- To use a custom config file, just say \"--files /path/to/log4j.properties\", and that gets distributed to the worker nodes and is available at the root of the classpath, so it overrides the default log4j-spark-container.properties.\n- To use a local config file, just say \"spark.executor.extraJavaOpts=-Dlog4j.configuration=file:/path/to/log4j.properties\"\n\nNote that since local: is broken in 1.0.0, the second one above cannot be achieved by using SPARK_LOG4J_CONF in that release.\n\nAs for backwards compatibility, SPARK_LOG4J_CONF doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, and the tricks above work fine with 1.0.0. I guess I could add the content of SPARK_LOG4J_CONF to the list of copied files if you think that's

Same for hql() (note in this case, the SQLConf should contain exactly the same pairs as the underlying HiveConf).\n- `sql(\"set key=val\")` will immediately set the key-val pair in the SQLConf. \n- `hql(\"set key=val\")` will immediately set the key-val pair in the SQLConf, as well as executing the command as a native Hive command.\n\nFor the last two cases above: the call returns a SchemaRDD. When .collect() is called on it, a string of the form \"key=val\" is returned (wrapped in Array).\n\n@rxin @marmbrus let me know if I miss anything.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45163066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45163350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/713#issuecomment-45163350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/713","id":45163350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTYzMzUw","user":{"login":"ktham","id":882701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjcwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/882701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham","html_url":"https://github.com/ktham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T23:05:11Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T23:05:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@pwendell that is of course a fair stance which I understand.\n\nRegarding the scalatest library, there were a lot of changes in the 2.x release, but most of the existing 1.x tests should still run with scalatest 2.1.5. In particular, what's noteworthy mainly that I would like to see this in is that they have a build for Scala 2.11. The rationale being that we will eventually want to cross compile with Scala 2.11, which means its inevitable that we will in anyways be required to raise this dependency version so long as we wish to use scalatest as our testing framework. That's an unfortunate drawback when depending on a scala library, that we must also depend on when they build for a particular Scala version :-(\n\nSo long as the test suite all passes, is there any reason why we would not want to bump scalatest up?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45163350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/45164362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/449#issuecomment-45164362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/449","id":45164362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTY0MzYy","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T23:17:44Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T23:17:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So now the failure is because your branch can't be merged automatically with master -- do you mind rebasing it on top of master?
