The license goes in the `License` line of the file, which is the case here. \n- The LICENSE file -- for R packages, this is where custom licenses go.  I've put the Apache license text into the file. \n- Files under r/R/*.R -- The files you identified here are BSD licensed.  They're from rscala, and no changes have been made.\n- RClient.scala -- The original file did not include the Apache license, but the file has been modified.   I've added a line to zeppelin-distribution/src/bin_license --- are we sure, though that that's correct?  We're not including binaries, we're making a derivative work from source.   \n- Console.scala - The license is BSD and BSD-style.  The bulk of the file is part of the source to scala itself, which is licensed under a \"BSD-style\" license.  http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/249.html  There are changes that were part of rscala,
