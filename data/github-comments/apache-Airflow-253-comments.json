Basically wrong scope zombie detection logic is placed inside the dag processor manager loop. A straightforward fix can be to extract the logic from heartbeat method to the the outter scope and then send the same version of zombies until the next zombie detection. If the subprocess zombie detection is really preferred, we can later bind the zombie detection logic with dag dir refresh logic to make sure that we send the same version of zombies to the dag file processors in the same round. I'll just go ahead and apply the straightforward fix. But I'm open to any other approach addressing the original zombie detection problem. Then later we can optimize the logic if desired.

So I feel we were not double-serializing. \r\n\r\nLast Night in this commit: https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/commit/2ab9c9b803a5697410c649337fe0602c3b852654 I changed it to Json columns and removed all json.loads & `json.dumps` code.\r\n\r\nI think you were under the assumption that we already changed to json columns or maybe I might be missing something.\r\n\r\nI will update this PR with the json column thing with the migration code you suggested (wasn't able to do it yet with 1.10.5 and other things).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528982114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529013621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5944#issuecomment-529013621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5944","id":529013621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTAxMzYyMQ==","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T21:03:30Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T21:03:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@potiuk I added a python pre-commit hook for isort, do you mind help me double check if it is what you had in mind please?\r\n\r\n@ashb Added the skip list and tested locally.\r\n\r\nI'll redo the PR right before I merge it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529013621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529023407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6022#issuecomment-529023407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6022","id":529023407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTAyMzQwNw==","user":{"login":"leahecole","id":6719667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTk2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6719667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole","html_url":"https://github.com/leahecole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leahecole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T21:40:54Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T21:40:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry @potiuk - it's dippy lil formatting errors.

Anyone should be able to run the script manually and it should **just work** ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529126721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529126778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6045#issuecomment-529126778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6045","id":529126778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTEyNjc3OA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-07T17:10:10Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T17:10:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And you can make it part of the docs_build script actually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529126778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529127050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6045#issuecomment-529127050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6045","id":529127050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTEyNzA1MA==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-07T17:13:53Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T17:13:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> And I noticed check_links.sh has no +x flag set (that's why you probably had to add it to shellcheck files).\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why the `docs/build.sh` file does not contain this flag?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529127050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529127060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6045#issuecomment-529127060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6045","id":529127060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTEyNzA2MA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-07T17:13:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T17:13:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Plus.

The problem was that when you thought you killed a running pre-commit check with ^C, the running container were still running. Pre-commit runs as many containers in the background as many processes you have so if you start running one or two of those in parallel  and a docker build on top of it, you can imagine that docker might get totally stuck (especially on MacOS where we mount files over the super-slow - in some cases - osxfs). In this case, it gets docker so slow that it even stops responding for a long time to a docker ps command from what I saw.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about it in here, where docker developers explain performance issues on osx and that they are working on improving it: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#performance-issues-solutions-and-roadmap\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses the problem in the way that any cancelled pre-commit or script-originated static check (with Ctrl^C/SIGTERM or any other catchable signal) will also cancel running pre-commit checks. Unlike running the The dumb-init entrypoint is designed in the way to propagate such signals to scripts executed as parameter of the entrypoint. I tested it and could reproduce both behaviours - before and after dumb-init and it works as expected (before dumb-init, cancelling pre-commit did not kill the running containers, after dumb-init they are killed immediately).

Or else just keep `store_serialised_dags=False`. If we want to support old versions or DB that don't support JSON columns, that we will have to handle those exceptions and store the serialised DAG (python dicts) as string and use json.loads and json.dump.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to deprecate old versions of MySQL that don't support JSON (I guess it is MySQL 5.7), unless there are many affected customers.

Will using JSONB makes it more efficient?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529294988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/529311930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6023#issuecomment-529311930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6023","id":529311930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTMxMTkzMA==","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T06:00:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T06:00:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@potiuk thanks for reviewing and the idea.
