this is a good question, something I have been thinking about too. The idea is to build a layer that will help in integrating column stats index with all java based engines like presto, trino and hive. This lays the foundation, since we need something like ranges or column domains so as to be able to filter the files using min and max values. Few classes here are actually inspired from those present in presto, but they are not exactly similar.\r\nWe can end up writing this logic in presto, but then a similar work will have to be done for trino as well. With this piece of code in Hudi, we just need an adapter in presto/trino to be able to call the api exposed for filtering files in this PR.\r\n\r\nAlthough since this is just the beginning of this work, I am open to hear others' thoughts on this.
