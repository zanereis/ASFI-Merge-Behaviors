@mateiz Thanks a lot for the comments and the fast response.\n\nAbout the config setting: I would feel more comfortable setting a default after there has been some experience with realistic workloads and schemas. But I renamed it now, as suggested by Matei.\n\nThe bigger changes in my last commit are now to keep track of what is actually pushed and why. Then the predicates which are \"completely\" pushed are removed inside the Planner. Note that attempting to push \"A & B\" can result only in \"A\" being pushed because B contains anything other than a simple comparison of a column value. In this case \"A & B\" should be kept for now (IMHO). There is still in advantage in pushing A since hopefully there are fewer records that pass the filter to the higher level.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41363813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41363914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/542#issuecomment-41363914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/542","id":41363914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzYzOTE0","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-25T06:57:13Z","updated_at":"2014-04-25T06:57:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.
