However the `NullWritable` is depending on a lot of classes. I first tried it by copy-pasting classes from Hadoop, but after the 5th file or so I gave up. I don't know how many files it will be in the end. \nBut it quickly becomes dangerous shipping Hadoop code due to incompatible versions.\n\nAlso, at the end of the day, people are going to have the Hadoop jars in their classpath anyways, because flink-runtime is depending on it.\n\nThe only argument left is probably the collection based execution. I think that one only requires flink-core and flink-java.

All in all: nice code!\n\nYou serialize Strings in most places by writing their byte length and their bytes: `out.writeInt(msg.getBytes().length);` and `out.writeBytes(msg.getBytes());`. In most other places, we used either `out.writeUtf8()`, or preferable `StringUtils.writeNullableString()` or `StingValue.writeString()`. Also, the above code frequently goes through the charset encoding code paths multiple, which is a bit unnecessary.\n\nThe encoding logic in the `NettyMessage` does a few unnecessary or at least clumsy steps. The reason seems to be that every message must compute its exact size before actually putting its contents into the netty buffer. We can simplify that by allowing the _write()_ call to allocate and return the target buffer by itself. That way, we can also implement code that does not really copy data into netty buffers, but only wraps existing NIO buffers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/66321956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/66325909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/254#issuecomment-66325909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/254","id":66325909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzI1OTA5","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-09T17:52:33Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T17:52:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `IntermediateResultPartitionManager` is not safe.

I will change it.\n\n**BufferFuture**: I initially thought that we might use them in a case like that. But not at the moment and therefore it indeed complicates things. I will revert that as well. ;)\n\n**Buffer references**: we don't use it at the moment, but we will need that in any case for the \"adaptive\" spilling or multiple consumers.

I think we could fix this still a bit and make it better:\n- Avro created a schema from the objects to serialize (somewhat a simple thing as our POJO analysis). That way, it does not need to write all classnames. Kryo writes all classnames by default, which is very painful, unless they are registered. I think that was one of the reasons why Avro was actually faster for us out of the box.\n  - We should register the types at Kryo that we see as being (recursively contained in the type information)\n  - We should also allow at the execution environment to manually register types or serializers.\n- Why is the `copy()` method not using Kryo's copy functionality? The current implementation seems painfully inefficient, and will still be used until @aljoscha 's change about reuse/non-reuse mode is in.\n- The tests that have a hardwired check for the KryoSerializer break design...\n\nIt seems that the Java/Scala code is moving closer together still, with the common serializer being configured in the Java API for Scala classes.

The windowed join on named fields of case classes is simply beautiful.\n\nI like the project structure, adding the streaming scala code under flink-scala. Another somewhat viable option could be to open a flink-streaming-scala project (and rename flink-streaming-core to f-s-java, or even have separate f-s-core and f-s-java projects). \n\nWould like to merge it soon, because it not only includes the streaming scala API but some much needed refactor of our java API.\n\nAlso would like to try out the scala API by implementing the examples with a couple of volunteers. The streaming examples are fairly short and straightforward compared to the batch ones, so a handful of people is more than enough in that department. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/67776196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
