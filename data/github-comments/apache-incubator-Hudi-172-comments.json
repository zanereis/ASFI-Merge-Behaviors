It is indeed possible to create a set of configs say `hoodie.deltastreamer.xxx` to achieve this. But first i want to understand why it is not possible for you to submit args via Livy API. from what i read, https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Community-Articles/How-to-Submit-Spark-Application-through-Livy-REST-API/ta-p/247502, livy does allow you to specify args to the spark app.\r\n\r\n> My thought is to implement this through python code with sparksession and do the livy submit calling the pyfile.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what this pyfile is supposed to contain. Is it about generating 100 deltastreamer jobs in code and calling Livy API to submit them? In this case I still don't see why you can't pass arguments there and have to go via hudi options.

We are looking to add record level index and some work is in progress on this end. You can follow the work [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3508) and [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC-08++Record+level+indexing+mechanisms+for+Hudi+datasets).\n\nThank you. Any idea when this new index be available?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/974826710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/974848916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4043#issuecomment-974848916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4043","id":974848916,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46GwOU","user":{"login":"Limess","id":3199181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTkxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3199181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess","html_url":"https://github.com/Limess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Limess/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-21T16:25:08Z","updated_at":"2021-11-21T16:34:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"`_hoodie_is_deleted` is the added column, sorry I misquoted it above.\r\n\r\nI believe this should have been added to the end of the schema, although I'm not sure how the ordering will have actually ended up in Hudi given we added this column in the source parquet files at the end, and add `story_published_partition_date` in the SQL transformer (`SELECT * story_published_partition_date as story_published_date FROM <src>`) - maybe this use of the SQL transformer is a mistake and we should be explicitly ordering columns?\r\n\r\ni.e. the process:\r\n\r\n1.

We noticed before at some point we were getting errors since the user running the job had no priviliges on the dfefault db in hive.

@prashantwason : I was half way through fixing finalize write to also delete extra marker files, but on second thought, wondering if we really need this fix for deleting the extra marker files in finalize write. \r\nso, far I have moved the finalize write before updating metadata table. but to delete the extra markers, we need to fix timeline server based which is not trivial (need to add an endpoint). this is not the main issue.\r\n\r\nAnyways, coming back to my point:  \r\nThis is a very tiny widow we are trying to solve here, and a large window anyways will have the gap we are looking to fix. \r\nfor eg, this will help us only when a partially failed commit is getting rolledback, and it failed just after writing to metadata table, but before committing to data table. In every other scenario, this is not going to help. \r\n- Incase, the commit failed even before writing to metadata table, this fix may not help. \r\n- If this represents a restore operation, we will do list based rollback. And so marker files does not matter. \r\n\r\nI feel like we are not gaining much by fixing this tiny window. \r\nThis is what I am thinking. I will move the finalize write before writing to metadata table. but will not delete the additional marker files. I don't feel we have much ROI. \r\nLet me know your opinion.
