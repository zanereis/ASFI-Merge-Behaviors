I have an idea about the concurrent issues which is possibly occurred during changing the structure of MTree. \r\n\r\nThe safest solution is to synchronize all methods that may invoke ```mnode.addChild``` and ```mnode.replaceChild```, including ```setStorageGroup``` in MTreeAboveSG and ```createTimeserie```, ```createAlignedTimeseries``` and ```getDeviceNodeWithAutoCreate``` in MTreeBelowSG. \r\n\r\nThis will make all ```setStorageGroup``` in parallel and make all timeseries and device creation in parallel in one storage group. This definitely affects the performance. \r\n\r\nThe creation of storage group is not that frequent, while the creation of timeseries is frequent. If the performance of timeseries creation decrease to a degree that we cannot accept, may be we could add a interface for atomic creation of batched timeseries under one certain device. I think this is worthy, since we can group batched creation of timeseries into one record in MLog, which increases the disk I/O.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1067907358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1067910130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/5246#issuecomment-1067910130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/5246","id":1067910130,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM4_pwPy","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-15T12:06:13Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T12:06:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
