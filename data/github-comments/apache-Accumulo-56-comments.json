It's certainly similar in nature. This catching of Throwable, and/or not setting UncaughtExceptionHandlers on threads we spin off is really likely to bite us. It'd be great if we could take a comprehensive look at 1) all occurrences of us catching Throwable to verify their correctness, and 2) check all thread management code to ensure we properly handle uncaught exceptions.; The main problem is there's a *lot* (of both) of those. This issue is a specific find that was directly observed to be problematic (luckily, it occurred during testing and not on a production system), that can be fixed in a targeted way, regardless of whether we get a chance to do the comprehensive look at the rest.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/733839847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/733847439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1810#issuecomment-733847439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1810","id":733847439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzg0NzQzOQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-25T17:30:38Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T17:30:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1798#discussion_r529826482","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/733847439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/733912653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1812#issuecomment-733912653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1812","id":733912653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzkxMjY1Mw==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-25T19:41:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T19:41:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am pretty sure that this change cannot be back ported to 1.10 as is - there must be something else going on that makes the watcher required for this version.

If the loop is an infinite loop, the only way the test won't time out is if the conditions are met. For extra measure, you can add additional assert statements after the loop.

However, it's not just the existence check on its own... it's specifically the existence check _with_ the watcher, because a watcher passed to an `exists` method will register to watch for node creation events, while a watcher passed to a `getData` method will register to watch for node changed events. ZooCache needs both to work correctly.\r\n\r\nI partially agree with you.  I do not think that we need a watcher for everytime we call `exists()`.  I read the comment to mean that we need the `ZCacheWatcher` to be on the `exists()`, which I am not convinced is true anymore.  The `ZCacheWatcher` only ever removes from the cache.  Removal from the cache should probably be handled with a timeout like we do with the Guava caches.  This is a separate issue though.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there may be other watchers being passed in that depend on the event trigger from the `exists()` method, which I believe is what you are saying.  Unfortunately this code is awful and its really hard to figure out which watchers depend on this event.  @EdColeman and I were hoping we could at least fix #1809 until it can be rewritten.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/735801360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/735809919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1812#issuecomment-735809919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1812","id":735809919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTgwOTkxOQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-30T14:12:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T14:12:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @EdColeman and I were hoping we could at least fix #1809 until it can be rewritten.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that this breaks a unit test (ZooCacheTest is now failing), I don't have a high degree of confidence that this isn't going to break other things.

You could print a helpful message for the Exception with the empty message and let everything else go up to Shell.  The execute method throws Exception.

It would be _really_ helpful to have a more descriptive name (rather than just a unique one to differentiate it).

The derived classes all seemed too longer to me... TabletMemStateImpl or TestTabletMemState, especially since the class is usually the impl quite a bit.  The only thing I extracted about this inner class from looking at the code was that it had to do with Memory.  What about MemoryState, TabMemory, TMemoryState, MemState?\r\n\r\n> But, the javadoc would still be helpful to understand what kind of \"state\" and what the \"mem\" means, like what's this state for? how is it used? why does it exist? The method names in the interface provide clues, but without diving deeper, I don't really know the answer to these questions... they are just the first thing I think when seeing a name like \"TabletMem\" (or even \"TabletMemState\").\r\n\r\nI agree but your guess is as good as mine.
