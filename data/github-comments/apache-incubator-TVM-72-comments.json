But indeed shuffle can be useful in certain cases. This is something I have been debating about recently. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, shuffle will enrich the semantics of the low-level IR and makes it easy to generate complicated vector instructions.  On the other hand, such additional complexity and expressiveness introduced, while being good for LLVM, may create additional burdens for other backends, especially the accelerator part. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of shuffle instruction in the low-level IR over specific shuffle intrinsics is that we can introduce rewriting pass to optimize code that involving shuffle. The drawback is mainly the additional expressiveness being dealt during code lowering.  One could argue that we should make use of LLVM for the job of shuffle optimization, instead of trying to do it in the loop IR level. \r\n\r\nMy current take is that given that the shuffle is not the bottleneck of our current workload so far, we might not have to bring this additional complexity yet, but I am also open to the other option.\r\n

   As much as I would initially prefer the visibility specifier showing up in the header file as you did, I could not resolve the conflict with the Doxygen parser getting confused. After I give it more thought I find there is no justification to put it in header files. A header file is the place where provider and user agree on something, like \"This is how this particular function call protocol should look like\". A visibility specifier is NOT about what the function should look like (what parameter it takes, what is the return value, etc. etc.) but something that tells the compiler to make something in the current translation unit available by making it visible. The Microsoft way of defining either dll_import or dll_export in the header file, depending on who includes that header file, is awful. Now different parties no longer agrees on what the header file looks like: It's a \"One Macro, but up to different interpretation what the macro is\", defeating what a header file should do.\r\n\r\nThus it makes more sense to have the visibility specifier not where function protocol is define, but rather where the definition of the function is, i.e., where an actual function sits. like \"Here is the actual function and I want to export it.\" For the same reason, it is absurd to add the visibility specifier to a virtual function, or even a pure virtual function in a header file. \"I want to export a pure virtual function which actually does not exist (???)\".\r\n\r\nDo you now agree that the place where a function is implemented is the logically right place to specify that it should be made visible and exported, not the place a function is declared?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455647397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/455669813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2461#issuecomment-455669813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2461","id":455669813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTY2OTgxMw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T19:59:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T19:59:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it is probably worthy to have a separate API for serialization.

It expands the TVM_DLL macro into __attribute__((visibility(\"default\"))) and thought that must be the corresponding function protocol, and it is puzzled that the parameters cannot be found.
