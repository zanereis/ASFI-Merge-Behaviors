Building in the rpm build source data directories (SPEC and SOURCES) directly into the image rather than using BIND share with the associated IO penalty.\r\n2. Having the rpm build working directories (BUILD and BUILDROOT), as simply runtime ephemeral directories inside the docker image, again skipping the IO penalty of bind shares.\r\n3. Having the rpm build output directories (RPMS and SRPMS) as simply runtime ephemeral directories inside the docker image as well.  RPMLINT is run on the rpms in these output directories as one of the last steps in the docker rpmbuild process.  Running RPMlint on a bind share was a big IO penalty.\r\n4. A new last step which actually used to be run by maven. Copying files from RPMS/SRPMS directories to the project \"**target**\" directory.  The \"**target**\" directory is now the only shared bind directory used to move data from the running docker image to the project build directory.  \r\n\r\nPushing this last step inside the running docker image allows rpmlint to process the rpms while they are still sitting on the higher-performing in-docker filesystems, rather then while the RPMS are sitting on a shared bind directory.\r\n\r\nThe readme was updated to show the new location that rpms are located once the docker image has finished running as it does this \"move to target directory\" step rather then the maven process;","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/528135292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/528137707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1501#issuecomment-528137707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1501","id":528137707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODEzNzcwNw==","user":{"login":"tigerquoll","id":8340922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDA5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8340922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll","html_url":"https://github.com/tigerquoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T23:55:23Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T23:57:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc Fair question.\r\nDuring the maven prepare phase for the packaging project, the jars from all of the metron sub-project target directories get copied into the rpm-docker/SOURCES directory.  This then becomes the source of the new docker image.\r\n\r\nDocker keeps track (i.e. checksums) all of the source data used to build each step of a docker image (This is called the docker context).  When you rebuild a docker image, docker compares the checksums to the source data, and skips the build process if nothing in the docker context of that image has changed.\r\n\r\nThe rpm-docker build process builds both docker images *every* times it runs.  Most times the first image has no changes in its source files, so the build is skipped.  The second build process (the one that embeds Metron jars) will actually skip as well if none of the Metron source jars have changed. (bonus optimisation!).  But in all cases, the jars embedded in the docker image will be a 100% match with the jars that are in rpm-docker/SOURCES .\r\n\r\nThis \"keeping track of docker contexts\" is fundamental to how the docker build process runs, and has been validated and tested by everyone who utilises docker over many years.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/528137707/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/528151015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1287#issuecomment-528151015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1287","id":528151015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODE1MTAxNQ==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T01:01:32Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T01:01:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nothing more to add than I mentioned before.

You could reference a `ServiceDiscoveryImpl` in 2 separate processes (1 in the integration test process, the other in the application master container process spawned by YARN) with no issue.
