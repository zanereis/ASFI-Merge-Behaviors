Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nIf the suffix of the created folder or the folder name is the same as that of the viewable file, the folder can be edited (the Edit button is on, and an error will be reported if you click Edit)\r\nFor example, folder names: conf, Java, YML, test.conf\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nOnly files should be editable, and the Folder Edit button should not be on\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nThis case can be reproduced by creating a folder with the same folder name as the file suffix that can be viewed\r\nViewable file suffixes can be found in create file - file format（可查看的文件后缀名可以在创建文件-文件格式中找到）\n\n###

is only the first step of this feature\r\n\r\n## Some idea in the further\r\n\r\nAfter this patch merged, we could batch load sql scripts to DS and create workflow for it. Of course he can automatically create workflow, after we add some hints in sql scripts header.\r\n\r\nLet me think about which part we could improve, and maybe you could find it. Yeah, it called autodag base on we adding some addition information for original file. It could be simplify by using sql script name as task name, and using `sql parser` to analyze the dependences. And maybe that is the true `AutoDAG`.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the scope of this issue, cause `sql parser` is a little difficult and not urgent for this moment. we should hold this until our community finish and done their important things.\r\n\r\n## SQL scripts example\r\n\r\nAnd here is an example about sql scripts. It just contain original sql scripts, our lovely `sql parser` would parse the dependence and set tasks relations\r\n\r\n* `start.sql`:\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  insert into table start_auto_dag select 1;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `child1.sql`:\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  insert into table branch_one select * from start_auto_dag;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `branch_two.sql`:\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  insert into table branch_two select * from start_auto_dag;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `end.sql`:\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  insert into table end_auto_dag\r\n  select * from branch_one union all\r\n  union all\r\n  select * from branch_two union all\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n* `independence.sql`: If upstream hint not set, we would use `root` as default. So it would become independence task in the workflow\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  select 'I am the independence of this workflow'\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nAfter we submit and DS parse, would could get workflow as below\r\n\r\n```\r\n                   -> branch_one ->\r\n                 /                  \\\r\nstart_auto_dag ->                     -> end_auto_dag\r\n                 \\                  /\r\n                   -> branch_two
