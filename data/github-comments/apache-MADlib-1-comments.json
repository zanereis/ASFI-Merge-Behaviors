Maybe that's because I'm a database guy and not a statistician, but there's no documentation and very little in the way of comments.\n\nWhat would be very helpful to me would be docs/comments about what the module is trying to provide, as well as docstrings for any functions whose purpose is non-obvious. There also needs to be explanation about the handling of NULLs. If the normal aggregate behavior of ignoring NULLs isn't desired, I think something like avg(coalesce({observed_col}, 0)) is better than re-rolling the aggregate functions by hand.\n\nMaking multiple independent queries against {table_in} will be very, very costly if that table is large. Additionally, creating lots of temp tables bloats the catalog. It's much better to write a single query that produces your output. A larger concern is that this will become very, very painful if you have 10 or 20 columns that you want to test against. I would think that all these functions should accept lists of columns, not just single prediction_col,observed_col.\n\nFinally, please take a look at the built-in statistics aggregate functions (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-STATISTICS-TABLE), and see if any of them will do what's necessary. If not then if I knew what the deficiencies were we could propose addressing them with the Postgres community.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/216642133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/216651893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/madlib/pull/41#issuecomment-216651893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/41","id":216651893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjY1MTg5Mw==","user":{"login":"orhankislal","id":9490520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTA1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9490520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal","html_url":"https://github.com/orhankislal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orhankislal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T20:16:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T20:16:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your comments decibel.

The name for the view/table will be specified in the output_table parameter.\n- **output_all_columns** (T/F): default is **fault**.\n  - (FALSE) will output the partition columns, time_stamp column and a new session ID column. The assumption is that the partition columns with the time_stamp column will be sufficient to perform a join with the input table.\n  - (TRUE) will output all the columns in the table, along with the new session_id column.\n\n2) Other optional parameters such as **min_time** and **persist_null** can also be specified in \"params\" (details of these will be updated in the JIRA). \n\nPlease let me
