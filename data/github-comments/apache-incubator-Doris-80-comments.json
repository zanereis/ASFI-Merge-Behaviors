I think we should set the parallel parameter to half of the build machine's CPU core. Because many user feel build process is too slow and we have to told them that there is parameter to speed up. But many user will not ask for help and they will treat the slow build process as normal.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default value is 1/4 of cpu core. Using 1/2 may cause OOM exception(I am not really sure about that).\r\nIt there any \"best practice\" that we can refer to?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1060225204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1060231896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/8352#issuecomment-1060231896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/8352","id":1060231896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs4_MdrY","user":{"login":"yiguolei","id":9208457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9208457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei","html_url":"https://github.com/yiguolei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T06:18:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T06:18:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\nIf too many build thread will cause OOM, then it is ok for me.

Please describe the motivation and any possible performance impact, so that other reviewers can directly know what is going on.\r\n\r\nthe motivation is to use the function of STL instead of wrapper of pthread_rwlock_t by ourselves, which is more portable.\r\n\r\nExact behavior is not specified by the standard. But here are some clues:\r\nOn POSIX systems shared_mutex will most likely be implemented on top of pthread_rwlock_t and implementations usually give preference to readers because of its requirement to support recursive read locks.\r\n\r\nreference as
