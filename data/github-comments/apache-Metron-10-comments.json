tested in single node vagrant.  \n\nDid the following:\n- Created a config called `custom` at `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/custom.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"custom\",\n  \"parserConfig\" : {\n    \"mapStrategy\" : \"UNFOLD\"\n  }\n}\n```\n- Created kafka topic for `custom` via `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic custom --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\n- Loaded the configs into zookeeper via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh --mode PUSH -i /usr/metron/0.2.0BETA/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\n- Started the topology via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s custom`\n- Created some sample data in `~/test_data.dat`:\n\n```\n{ \"foo\" : \"bar\" }\n{ \"map\" : { \"blah\" : 1 } }\n{ \"foo\" : \"grok\", \"map\" : { \"blah\" : { \"tim\" : \"sort\"

This should mimic the quick-dev environment (unfortunately, I haven't had much luck with vagrant due to my primary OS being Windows).\n\nTest Steps\n\n1) Deploy single node vm using metron_full_install ansible playbook (I can provide my host and group_vars if anyone is interested)\n\n2) Stop unused parsers\n`monit stop pcap-parser`\n`monit stop yaf-parser`\n`monit stop bro-parser`\n`monit stop snort-parser`\n\n3) Install elasticsearch head\n`/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin install mobz/elasticsearch-head`\n\n4) Start the asa parser topology\n`start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s asa`\n\n5) Use the console producer to load raw asa events into kafka\n`/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic asa < asa_raw.txt`\nFor test data I used the sample data provided for integration testing and raw data collected from one of my devices.\n\n6) Verify events in elasticsearch\nUsing the head plugin, I could browse the asa_index_\\* index and see the enriched events\n\nFuture enhancements\n\n1) I could not add the asa\\* indexes to kibana. I believe an elasticsearch template is required. I'll be working on that as a future PR.\n\n2) Minor bug in one of the ansible roles (metron_common). The logic to verify the jars exist is done remotely and should be done locally. I'll submit a separate JIRA and PR for this fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/250150977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/250187296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/280#issuecomment-250187296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/280","id":250187296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDE4NzI5Ng==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T14:42:54Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T14:42:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do we need to change something like the following?

It's the yaf probe that @dlyle65535 is stopping by not installing it.\n\nIn general, just my $0.02, but I tend think the proper behavior is as follows:\n- All sensors get installed by default; bro, snort, yaf, etc.\n- None of them get started by default in either full-dev or quick-dev.  If you want them to start, turn them on via monit\n\nI'm not sure this should be within the scope of this PR, which is why @dlyle65535 made METRON-467.  As for what we do in the interrim, I'd say that either:\n- we either are ok with not installing yaf\n- we make the sensors not in the `services_to_start` not start, not just the topologies.\n\nThoughts and corrections would be greatly appreciated. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/250331297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/250332004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/279#issuecomment-250332004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/279","id":250332004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDMzMjAwNA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T23:35:00Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T23:35:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"just by the way, the above comments are just my opinions.

Here is why.  If fulldev can only support 2 running parser topologies I think it makes sense to let a user pick which 2 they want.  The intention of vagrant dev images is to spin them up to test a PR and then destroy them.  We generally only need a few topologies for that and it is not the intention to use vagrant images to simulate a full running system.  By having only 2 topologies started by default we will avoid 90% of problems people have when they spin up the vagrant images and run out of memory.  With that said I will also document what needs to be done to spin up the image with 4 topologies, but put a disclaimer to start at their own risk.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/250336198/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/250336517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/279#issuecomment-250336517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/279","id":250336517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDMzNjUxNw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T00:05:16Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T00:05:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@james-sirota sounds good to me.

Since this is proprietary data we cannot host it in Metron.\n\nWe agreed that we just want to cover two use cases:\n1. The user wants to download the latest data from MaxMind.  This is the default behavior.\n2. The user wants to use data that is hosted at an alternative URL.  The alternative URL could be HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.  This might occur when running Metron on an isolated/secure network or a test environment.\n\nTo cover these two use cases, we won't need the `metron-deployment/roles/mysql_server/files/geodata.tar.xz`
