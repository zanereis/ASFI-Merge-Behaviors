It's a minor change but still worth discussing with a wider audience.\n\nI implemented an equivalent \"fair\" assignor for the new consumer last night (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/979). For that pull request I added a new test (testMultipleConsumersUnbalancedSubscriptions) for each of the 3 implementations, that illustrates the skewed assignments for the range and roundrobin assignors with a borderline worst-case scenario.\n\nFor the new consumer we could certainly include a custom implementation in our own code if the KIP gets rejected. In that case I think we should at least document somewhere that the roundrobin assignor can give somewhat suboptimal results if the subscriptions are not identical (which is/will be allowed as of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2172).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/189305905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/189306514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/870#issuecomment-189306514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/870","id":189306514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTMwNjUxNA==","user":{"login":"miguno","id":294849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno","html_url":"https://github.com/miguno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T14:37:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T14:37:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In general LGTM.\n\nRegarding examples:\n- I would add a brief class jjavadoc to each example (such as `PageViewUnTypedJob`) to explain what each example does/what it demonstrates.

On initial startup, the DistributedHerder makes sure we've read to the end of the log (we should probably discuss whether the way it does this synchronously with indefinite timeouts is also a problem). But in the failure case now, we may fail to read to log end, hit the timeout, leave the group, and then won't the subsequent tick immediately rejoin the group despite not having read to the end of the log? Seems like this will result in flapping membership in the group if the config topic can't be properly consumed.\n\nSo now this is making me think that the `readConfigToEnd` might not even be in the right place to handle this case. Maybe it should be another phase in `tick()` that comes first, controlled by a flag like the `needsReadToEnd` in `handleRebalanceCompleted` but is saved in the instances state so it continues to be attempted even if it continues to fail due to timeouts.\n\nI'm also beginning to think it might be time to create a state diagram for this -- it seems to be pretty complicated...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/191092022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
