I was afraid of submitting this PR as I was not able to run all the tests, hence I was not able to confirm it prior doing official attempt.\r\nI thought of bridging `GridSpringResourceContext` to updated API and I think its entirely doable with adapter I attempted to draw in ignite-spring module. We just need to map `@SpringResource` and `@SpringApplicationContext` annotations to the `GridInjectResourceContext`. One note - I am not certain about use `@SpringApplicationContext` and if we will be able to cover its all use cases, as it was carried a bit differently than regular beans. From compilation point of view it should work, because most of ioc stuff was private to ignite-core so far.\r\n\r\nIf you can hold for few days I will use this time to make a prototype of injection registry working under osgi to confirm whole concept works beyond Spring. I will be able to contribute other thing to `ignite-osgi-ext` in later step.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/1287494373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/1287754781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/10337#issuecomment-1287754781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/10337","id":1287754781,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs5MwZQd","user":{"login":"SammyVimes","id":4058545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes","html_url":"https://github.com/SammyVimes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SammyVimes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-22T10:27:34Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T10:27:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @splatch!
