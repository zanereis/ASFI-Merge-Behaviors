Are we sure that we do not change the configuration of certain streaming features such as `enableTimestamps()`, `disableTimestamps()`, `setAutoWatermarkInterval()`? I find these options in combination with `TimeCharacteristics` very confusing and I'm not sure if we should mark them already stable. I talked to @aljoscha and he's not satisfied with the current implementation as well.\n- `ExecutionMode`: IMO, the name is quite generic for it's purpose. The mode is is only relevant for network shuffles in the batch programs.\n- `JobExecutionResult.getIntCounterResult()`: Do we need and want to keep this method? IMO, it should be rather deprecated than marked as stable. \n- `Partitioner`: Does it make sense to extend the `partition(K key, int numPartition)` method by a paramter for the current partitionId? I remember I had some use cases for this, but forgot about the details.\n\nWe need to carefully check the class hierarchy of public/stable classes. For example, if we make `DefaultInputSplitAssigner` a `Public` interface, we don't need to make `InputSplitAssigner` `Experimental` because we cannot touch it then. There might be more of these cases in this PR (and PR #1428). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165171199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165382644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1461#issuecomment-165382644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1461","id":165382644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTM4MjY0NA==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T08:29:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T08:29:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is very useful, also for instance when there are not enough task slots etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165382644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165382891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1461#issuecomment-165382891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1461","id":165382891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTM4Mjg5MQ==","user":{"login":"gyfora","id":5880972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora","html_url":"https://github.com/gyfora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyfora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T08:30:27Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T08:30:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165382891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165398018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1461#issuecomment-165398018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1461","id":165398018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTM5ODAxOA==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T09:38:24Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T09:38:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review.

Now, the results are the same regardless of whether they are reused (except in case 3), making it little more then a reduce test.

Both times no combiner was used.\nFirst of all, both programs compute the same result and the result of the range partitioned WordCount is ordered. So the implementation is correct.\n\nThe hash partitioned WC took 8:00 mins and the range partitioned 13:17 mins. \nThe breakdown of the range partitioned WC looks as follows:\n1. Source+FlatMap: 3:01 mins\n2. LocalSample: 3:01 mins\n3. GlobalSample: 0:15 mins\n4. Histogram: 24 ms\n5. PreparePartition: 8:49 mins\n6. Partition: 8:48 mins\n7. GroupReduce: 10:14 mins\n8. Sink: 1:09 mins\n\nThe breakdown of the hash partitioned WC is:\n1. Source + FlatMap: 6:26 mins\n2. Partition: 6:25 mins\n3. GroupReduce: 7:58 mins\n4. Sink: 1:21 mins\n\nSo, the overhead of the range partitioned WC comes from additional IO of reading the flatMapped words and the additional 4-byte integer. Also the sorting of the group reduce does not happen concurrently with the source IO. Reducing (w/o sort) and sink take about the same amount of time.\n\nI also check the distribution of input and output records / bytes for the GroupReduce.\n\n|  | min records-in | min bytes-in | max records-in | max bytes-in |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hash | 197M | 1.82GB | 346M | 2.90GB |\n| Range | 177M | 1.41GB | 352M | 2.90GB |\n\n|  | min records-out | min bytes-out | max records-out | max bytes-out |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hash | 2.5M | 26.5MB | 2.5M | 26.5MB |\n| Range | 2.3K | 28.2KB | 14M | 154MB |\n\nWe see that the range partitioner does not perform better (in fact a bit worse) than the hash partitioner (the differences for output records are expected). Maybe increasing the sample size helps? The overhead of reading the the intermediate data set from disk is so high, that a more fine-grained histogram can be justified, IMO. How about increasing the sample size from `parallelism * 20` to `parallelism * 1000`?\n\nOther thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165453966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165462700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1465#issuecomment-165462700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1465","id":165462700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTQ2MjcwMA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T14:15:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T14:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your feedback @tillrohrmann.\nMany parts could be expressed in more Scala style, but for performance reasons and to prevent bugs in this crucial component I chose simple while loops and tried to be as close as possible to already proven code (esp.

The most difference between `HashParition` and `RangePartition` is that, `HashParition` is key-wise partition(elements with same key would shuffled to same target), and `RangePartition` is key-wise and partition-wise partition(the partition is in order as well), so for global order, we can sort in parallel after `RangePartition`, that's what we can benefit from `RangePartition`.\nOn the other side, it's still make sense to improve `RangePartition` performance, although i don't think increasing the sample size would help here.

However, producing balanced partitions does not seem to work so well. Looking at the numbers I posted, the partitions produced by the range partitioner are less balanced than the hash partitioned ones (records-in / bytes-in). The difference is not huge, but still range partitioning should be able to do better than hash partitioning.\n\nI proposed to increase the sample size, because this should improve the accuracy of the histogram without having a (measurable) impact on the performance.

Different strategies are conceivable. For instance, what we have right now, a fixed delay restart strategy. Additions could be an exponential backoff restart strategy or later a scale in/out restart strategy. Furthermore, this allows to set the delays on a per job basis which might be relevant for specific SLAs.\n\nBut in general it's more like a preliminary step towards the scale in/out restart strategy, I guess.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165754886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165754941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1338#issuecomment-165754941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1338","id":165754941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTc1NDk0MQ==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-18T11:38:01Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T11:38:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Olrite. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165754941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/165779642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1468#issuecomment-165779642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1468","id":165779642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTc3OTY0Mg==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-18T13:33:30Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T13:33:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've created https://docs.google.com/document/d/1987ydc2rez79Pph7qBbcXwu6XzMU2Hm-nX8kORLoZBM/edit?usp=sharing and added the config renaming as an API breaking change.
