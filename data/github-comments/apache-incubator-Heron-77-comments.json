quick review of the code in the `heron/schedulers/src/java/org/apache/heron/scheduler/kubernetes/` directory, and some other related code:\r\n\r\n* `KubernetesConstants`: namespaced constants for configurations.\r\n* `KubernetesContext`: child class of `Context` with Kubernetes specific keys used to lookup values (no \"setters\", only \"getters\") stored in the supplied `Config` object.\r\n* `KubernetesController`: the basic interface with Kubernetes to recover info about the topology configs as well as submit/kill/restart them.\r\n* `KubernetesLauncher`: used to submit a topology to the Kubernetes cluster.\r\n* `KubernetesScheduler`: the interface to manage the cluster, get info, kill, restart, resize, and update the cluster size based on the topology. It contains a `KubernetesController` object which facilitates the comms with the cluster.\r\n* `KubernetesUtils`: various logging utilities.\r\n* `V1Controller`: child class of the `KubernetesController` which contains the actual logic to interface with the Kubernetes cluster. The `PackingPlan` for the instances is central to operations with configurations stored in a `ContainerPlan` object.\r\n* `Volumes`: utilities used to configure the clusters storage volumes.\r\n* `PackingPlan`: `heron/spi/src/java/org/apache/heron/spi/packing/` has the classes for `PackingPlan`, `InstancePlan` and `ContainerPlan`.\r\n\r\nI have very quickly compiled a basic `Pod Config`:\r\n```YAML\r\n# POD CONFIG WITH TEMPLATE:\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Pod\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: heron-node\r\nspec:\r\n  replicas: 2\r\n  selector:\r\n    matchLabels:\r\n      app: heron-node\r\n  template:\r\n    metadata:\r\n      labels:\r\n        app: heron-node\r\n    spec:\r\n      containers:\r\n      - name: heron-node\r\n        image: centos:8\r\n        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo \"Heron Kubernetes node.\" && sleep 3600']\r\n        resources:\r\n          requests:\r\n            memory: \"1Gb\"\r\n            cpu: \"250m\"\r\n          limits:\r\n            memory: \"5Gb\"\r\n            cpu: \"500m\"\r\n        securityContext:\r\n          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false\r\n          capabilities:\r\n            add: [\"NET_ADMIN\", \"SYS_TIME\"]\r\n      restartPolicy: OnFailure\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code [snippet](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/de59e01aa4853ef951da080c0d1908d53d133ebe/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/features/PodTemplateConfigMapStep.scala#L39-L54) from Spark is appending the following to the pod config, which creates a `Volume` mount pointing to the pod config template:\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\n  volumes:\r\n    - name: pod-template-name  # from <POD_TEMPLATE_VOLUME>.\r\n      configMap:\r\n        name: configmap-name  # from <configmapName>.\r\n        items:\r\n        - key: pod-template-key  # from <POD_TEMPLATE_KEY>.\r\n          path: executor-pod-spec-template-file-name # from <EXECUTOR_POD_SPEC_TEMPLATE_FILE_NAME>.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code [snippet](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/de59e01aa4853ef951da080c0d1908d53d133ebe/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/features/PodTemplateConfigMapStep.scala#L56-L61) is adding the `Volume` mount pointing to a container config template:\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\n  volumes:\r\n    - name: pod-template-name  # from <POD_TEMPLATE_VOLUME>.\r\n      path: executor-pod-spec-template-mount-path # from <EXECUTOR_POD_SPEC_TEMPLATE_MOUNTPATH>.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe constants (caps naming convention) are defined [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/de59e01aa4853ef951da080c0d1908d53d133ebe/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/Constants.scala#L81-L85). If we are to follow what Spark is doing, we will need to declare these constants as conventions and document them. The most prudent place for these constants is `KubernetesConstants` as they will not be required outside. The `configmapName` is being acquired as [such](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/de59e01aa4853ef951da080c0d1908d53d133ebe/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/features/PodTemplateConfigMapStep.scala#L37).\r\n\r\nThe remaining two routines in the Spark code appear to be extracting information from the configs - they are not modifying them.\r\n\r\nThe question now is what functionality exists within Heron to modify the `Config` object to append the YAML elements to the `Config` as well as where (object) the actual pod/container configs are stored within the `Config`. Another question is if there is support for both containers and pods configs, and what the structure within the `Config` object is. Once we have an understanding of these things I can hammer out a solution.\r\n\r\nThe following are client API components to interface with Kubernetes:\r\n* `V1PodSpec`: [io.kubernetes.client.openapi.models.V1PodSpec](https://javadoc.io/static/io.kubernetes/client-java-api/13.0.0/io/kubernetes/client/openapi/models/V1PodSpec.html) configuration for the pods. Includes methods to `setVolumes` as well as `setSecurityContext`. This will be set in a `Pod Template`.\r\n* `V1PodTemplateSpec`: [io.kubernetes.client.openapi.models.V1PodTemplateSpec\r\n](https://javadoc.io/static/io.kubernetes/client-java-api/13.0.0/io/kubernetes/client/openapi/models/V1PodTemplateSpec.html) is the pod template config. This needs to be put into a `Stateful Set`.\r\n* `V1StatefulSetSpec`: [io.kubernetes.client.openapi.models.V1StatefulSetSpec](https://javadoc.io/static/io.kubernetes/client-java-api/11.0.0/io/kubernetes/client/openapi/models/V1StatefulSetSpec.html) sateful set config.\r\n* `V1StatefulSetSpecBuilder`: [io.kubernetes.client.openapi.models.V1StatefulSetSpecBuilder](https://javadoc.io/static/io.kubernetes/client-java-api/11.0.0/io/kubernetes/client/openapi/models/V1StatefulSetSpecBuilder.html) used to build/generate the `Stateful Set` configs.\r\n\r\nI have never used Heron and am learning about the workflow and setup as I go, so please bear with me. I am also still getting familiar with the vast codebase.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/911959524/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/915455115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3707#issuecomment-915455115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3707","id":915455115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps42kLyL","user":{"login":"surahman","id":3979925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman","html_url":"https://github.com/surahman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T18:04:31Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T18:04:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @nicknezis, I have a plan put together 🤔  and will start to hammer things out.

Please describe.*\n> There is little to no coverage of the code within the Kubernetes\n> V1Controller class. To be able to add and augment features to the\n> V1Controller we must ensure that we do not break existing functionality\n> and that all code, old and new, is fully covered with tests.\n>\n> *Describe the solution you'd like*\n> There is a basic test suite setup under\n> heron/schedulers/tests/java/org/apache/heron/scheduler/kubernetes/V1ControllerTest.java\n> in a WIP PR which needs to be extended for 100% code coverage of the entire\n> class.\n>\n> The major issue with testing this class is the private scoping of the\n> methods, but this constraint can be overcome using Java Reflections.\n> There is an example in the WIP PR on how to achieve this. A lot of the\n> statements within the methods go fairly deep into various other classes and\n> it is infeasible to generate a fully populated Config object to satisfy\n> the requirements. I encountered a number of null pointer exceptions, some\n> of which were drilled down into file reads. I feel like the best way to\n> handle testing the methods in the V1Controller class is to approach each\n> method individually and mock (mockito) the calls to methods outside the\n> class.\n>\n> I have created a checkPodTemplateConfigMap method in the test suite to\n> test the output of the Pod Template ConfigMap volume mounting. This was\n> done to permit a check of whether the statements added to include the\n> ConfigMap were correctly executed within createStatefulSet. The correct\n> way of handling this would be to setup a mock test that checks to see if\n> the podTemplateConfigMapName is called within createStatefulSet. It is\n> unnecessary to check if the ConfigMap is correct here as there is already\n> an isolated test for it. It would be prudent to refactor the\n> checkPodTemplateConfigMap into testPodTemplateConfigMapVolume once a mock\n> of createStatefulSet is completed.\n>\n> *Describe alternatives you've considered*\n> I have tried to generate fully populated Config Objects to try and\n> satisfy the requirements to use simple JUnit tests to no avail.\n>\n> *Additional context*\n> There is little to no test coverage of this class as it is right now.

Currently the Heron scheduler only starts with a default Pod that it creates from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis [Spark code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0494dc90af48ce7da0625485a4dc6917a244d580/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/submit/KubernetesDriverBuilder.scala#L30-L38) illustrates the branching logic that checks for an existing PodTemplate config item.\r\n\r\nThis is the [method](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bbb33af2e4c90d679542298f56073a71de001fb7/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/KubernetesUtils.scala#L96) used by Spark to actually load the template and create the pod spec.\r\n\r\nThe mounting of the ConfigMap as a volume, is actually something Spark specific that we might not need in Heron. In Spark there is a concept of a driver pod, and this creates the executor pods. So this is why they mount the Executor's PodTemplate ConfigMap into the Driver pod. If I'm not mistaken, our version of `loadPodFromTemplate` could directly lookup the ConfigMap PodTemplate without the need to mount the ConfigMap into the pod.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/920537024/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/920551592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3710#issuecomment-920551592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3710","id":920551592,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps423oCo","user":{"login":"surahman","id":3979925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman","html_url":"https://github.com/surahman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-16T03:42:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-16T18:11:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think I have an idea of what needs to happen... time to iterate :wink:.\r\n\r\n@nicknezis You are correct, Spark's architecture has a driver/coordinator with a fleet of executors.

The

indicates there is a built-in function in the K8S client library (scala and this potentially java too) that should handle the parse and assembly of the Pod Template.\r\n\r\nCurrently

The first line [downloads](https://github.com/joan38/kubernetes-client/blob/6fbf23b7a997e572456256c4714222ea734bd845/kubernetes-client/src/com/goyeau/kubernetes/client/api/PodsApi.scala#L119-L148) the file, assuming I am looking at the correct Scala K8s API, and the second retrieves a file descriptor/handle on the downloaded file:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval localFile = downloadFile(templateFileName, Utils.createTempDir(), conf, hadoopConf)\r\nval templateFile = new File(new java.net.URI(localFile).getPath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis third line then does the heavy lifting of reading the Pod Template into a Pod Config from the newly copied local file:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval pod = kubernetesClient.pods().load(templateFile).get()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe final line sets up the Spark container with the Pod Template and specified name:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nselectSparkContainer(pod, containerName)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMoving on to what we need to do on the Heron side:\r\n\r\n1. Read the `ConfigMap` name from the `--config-property` option. I set the key for this to `heron.kubernetes.pod.template.configmap.name` with the value being the file name.\r\n2. Read the YAML `ConfigMap` and extract the YAML node tree which contains the Pod Template. For this, we will either need a YAML parser or need to find a utility in the K8s Java API to do the job. I think the K8s Java API should include a utility for this, a lack thereof would remain a significant oversight on their part.\r\n3. Create a `V1PodTemplateSpec` object using the results from step 2.\r\n4. Iron out permission issues during testing, should they arise.\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with the K8s API but will start digging around for a YAML config to V1 object parser, if anyone is aware of where it is please let me know. There are some suggestions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java/issues/170) and the YAML reader within K8s is found [here](https://javadoc.io/static/io.kubernetes/client-java/6.0.1/io/kubernetes/client/util/Yaml.html).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/921992801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/922011806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3710#issuecomment-922011806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3710","id":922011806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps429Mie","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T18:54:50Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T18:54:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think that's correct, but steps 2 might be somewhat simpler than you describe.

Judging from [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/website2/docs/schedulers-k8s-by-hand.md) a config file is not submitted to the cluster for the executor Pods, but a default one is created by `createStatefulSet` and [submitted](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/396f2b848da0f56dcfda1d917928358133851cf5/heron/schedulers/src/java/org/apache/heron/scheduler/kubernetes/V1Controller.java#L126) with the job.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, and that has been my assumption thus far, then we would then need to read in the [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) file that was provided as a parameter to `--config-property`.

I have linked the API references below. The API reference for `listNamespacedConfigMap` states that only the namespace is a required parameter but I am running into issues with just providing the namespace. If you have any guidance on what to set these to it would be greatly appreciated, I am working on figuring them out.\r\n\r\nWe need to iterate over the `ConfigMap`s in the `KubernetesConstants.DEFAULT_NAMESPACE` and probe each for a key with the specified `podTemplateConfigMapName`. This data is stored as a String which will require the V1 YAML parser to convert it to the `V1PodTemplateSpec`.

Testing private methods is rather complicated and contrived. We might need to reconsider the access level of methods that require testing to be protected instead.\r\n\r\nRunning a Style Check prior to commits is not flagging issues locally.

This possesses the potential of being a silent error. As an alternative, I propose we implement the following protocol for naming and referencing the Pod Templates:\r\n`CONFIGMAP-NAME.POD-TEMPLATE-NAME`.\r\n\r\nThe `CONFIGMAP-NAME` would be the name of the ConfigMap where the Pod Template, named `POD-TEMPLATE-NAME` is located. The user would concatenate the two names with a `.`. We can safely rely on `kubectl` to ensure the ConfigMap and Pod Template names are unique.\r\n\r\nThis would mean creating a new protected method in `V1Controller` called `getPodTemplateLocation` which will return a `Pair` <`CONFIGMAP-NAME`, `POD-TEMPLATE-NAME`>. The string would be split on the first occurrence of a `.`, and if it is invalid an exception will be thrown.\r\n\r\nI will update the documentation being written up as soon as I have the new method completed, tested, and wired into `loadPodFromTemplate` with updated tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/926946450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/926950066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3710#issuecomment-926950066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3710","id":926950066,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps43QCKy","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-24T22:23:11Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T22:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems that Spark has a [hardcoded key](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ff3f3c45668364da9bd10992791b5ee9a46fea21/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/Constants.scala#L86) for the ConfigMap, but I think this is because they create the ConfigMap and mount it.

We then bind the Role to the `Service Account` [like so](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-subjects).\r\n\r\nFrom [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52995962/kubernetes-namespace-default-service-account):\r\n\r\n> 5. The default permissions for a service account don't allow it to list or modify any resources. The default service account isn't allowed to view cluster state let alone modify it in any way.\r\n\r\n**_Edit:_**\r\nIt appears as though the `ClusterRoles` and `ServiceAccount` are in the K8s configs for the Heron API Server:\r\n\r\n* [General](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/general/apiserver.yaml)\r\n* [Minikube](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/minikube/apiserver.yaml)\r\n\r\nThis makes life a lot easier with only the following being additionally required:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Role</summary>\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\r\nkind: Role\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: heron-apiserver-configmap-role\r\n  namespace: default\r\nrules:\r\n- apiGroups:\r\n  - \"\"\r\n  resources:\r\n  - configmaps\r\n  verbs:\r\n  - get\r\n  - watch\r\n  - list\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>RoleBinding</summary>\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\r\nkind: RoleBinding\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: heron-apiserver-configmap-rolebinding\r\n  namespace: default\r\nroleRef:\r\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\r\n  kind: Role\r\n  name: heron-apiserver-configmap-role\r\nsubjects:\r\n- kind: ServiceAccount\r\n  name: heron-apiserver\r\n  namespace: default\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI think it would be safe to add these to the Heron API Server K8s configs because it is adequately restrictive. It would be very unwise of anyone to place sensitive information in a general resource in any namespace, they should be using a `Secret`, and I believe we should not be opening a security loophole here.\r\n\r\nI also believe it is possible to assign multiple `Role`s and `ClusterRole`s to the same `ServiceAccount`. RBAC is additive and only whitelists permissions. @nicknezis, when you have some time, could you please once-over the `Role`s and test? If all is well I can update the K8s deployment scripts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/932636387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/932798773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3710#issuecomment-932798773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3710","id":932798773,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps43mWE1","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-02T18:25:49Z","updated_at":"2021-10-02T18:25:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I think I was running an old version of the image.

All other containers within the Pod Template will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Executor Container\r\n\r\nAll metadata for the `executor` container will be overwritten by Heron. In some other cases, values from the Pod Template for the `executor` will be overwritten by Heron as outline below.\r\n\r\n| Name | Description | Policy |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| `image` | The `executor` container's image. | Overwritten by Heron using values form the config.\r\n| `env` | Environment variables are made available within the container. The `HOST` and `POD_NAME` keys are required by Heron and are thus reserved. | Merged with Heron's values taking precedence. Deduplication is based on `name`.\r\n| `ports` | Port numbers opened within the container. Some of these port number are required by Heron and are thus reserved. The reserved ports are defined in Heron's constants as [`6001`-`6010`]. | Merged with Heron's values taking precedence. Deduplication is based on the `containerPort` value.\r\n| `limits` | Heron will attempt to load values for `cpu` and `memory` from its configs. If these values are not provided in the containers specs, Heron will place values from its configs. | User input takes precedence over Heron's values. This allows for per job custom resource limits.\r\n| `volumeMounts` | These are the mount points within the `executor` container for the `volumes` available in the Pod. | Merged with Heron's values taking precedence. Deduplication is based on the `name` value.\r\n| Annotation: `prometheus.io/scrape` | Flag to indicate whether Prometheus logs can be scraped and is set to `true`. | Value is are overridden by Heron. |\r\n| Annotation `prometheus.io/port` | Port address for Prometheus log scraping and is set to `8080`. | Values are overridden by Heron.\r\n| Annotation: Pod | Pod's revision/version hash. | Automatically set.\r\n| Annotation: Service | Labels services can use to attach to the Pod. | Automatically set.\r\n| Label: `app` | Name of the application lauching the Pod and is set to `Heron`. | Values are overridden by Heron.\r\n| Label: `topology`| The name of topology which was provided when submitting. | User defined and supplied on the CLI.\r\n\r\n### Pod\r\n\r\nThe following items will be set in the Pod Template's `spec` by Heron.\r\n\r\n| Name | Description | Policy |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | Grace period to wait before shutting down the Pod after a `SIGTERM` signal and is set to `0` seconds. | Values are overridden by Heron.\r\n| `tolerations` | Attempts to colocate Pods with `tolerations` and `taints` onto nodes hosting Pods with matching `tolerations` and `taints`. <br>  Keys:<br>`node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` <br> `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady` <br> `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable`. <br> Values (common):<br> `operator: \"Exists\"`<br> `effect: NoExecute`<br> `tolerationSeconds: 10L` | Values are overridden by Heron.\r\n| `containers` | Container images to be used on the executor Pods. | All `containers`, excluding the `executor`, are loaded as-is.\r\n| `volumes` | Volumes to be made available to the entire Pod. | Merged with Heron's values taking precedence. Deduplication is based on the `name` value.\r\n| `secretVolumes` | Secrets to be mounted as volumes within the Pod. | Loaded from the Heron configs if present.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/939633719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/941290266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3710#issuecomment-941290266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3710","id":941290266,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps44GvMa","user":{"login":"surahman","id":3979925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman","html_url":"https://github.com/surahman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-12T18:49:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T18:49:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Dangling references to topologies that fail to launch are now removed from the `Topology Manager` and `Scheduler`.
