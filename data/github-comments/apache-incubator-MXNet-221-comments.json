Could u show some examples of `mx.symbol`?  In fact `mxbox` provides [`mx.transforms.lambda`](https://github.com/Lyken17/mxbox/blob/master/mxbox/transforms/general.py#L140)  which allows user to easily create extensions . Thus supports for `mx.symbol` should not be a trouble issue.\r\n\r\n@zhreshold Gluon and mxbox are both inspired by torchvision, so they have many same functions. What I think is to keep the relation of `mxbox` and `mxnet`  like `pytorch` and `torchvision` -- standalone but strongly connected. The advantage of doing this is people can develop `mxbox` without affecting `mxnet` (push to `mxbox` only), and user can always enjoy the latest update of mxbox from PyPi.\r\n\r\nMaintaining a standalone toolbox will not be a nightmare, instead, it brings faster update -- for example, a new network comes out, once I get the definition scripts and the pretrained weight, I can upload to `mxnet` and give a release immediately, where in mxnet, it requires a reviewer to merge in and extra time to release a new version on PyPi.\r\n\r\nWe all aim for a good toolbox, and I think a standalone repo is a better choice. But as I mentioned, my free time on next semester is very limited, so to merge in or not, actually depends on later maintainers' idea. If he thinks merging to be a better choice, I will create a pull request after construction for `model` is

Judging by the code it should not work (it should either give you an error or result in a silent corruption), so the dtype option is just wrong and should not be there. For example to get UInt8 data type you need to use ImageRecordUInt8Iter.\r\nThe best way of getting fp16 data is to cast it to fp16 after it is produced in fp32 (I assume you are using GPU - this gives additional bonus of double buffering of data copies to GPU, so should generally be faster than just using ImageRecordIter and outputting fp16 format). Example of doing that is in example/image-classification/symbols/alexnet.py (resnet, resnet-v1, inception-v3 and v4 also have that, but alexnet is the simplest).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/321864377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/321865944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7424#issuecomment-321865944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7424","id":321865944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTg2NTk0NA==","user":{"login":"ptrendx","id":8398980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg5ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8398980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrendx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrendx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-11T17:00:41Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T17:00:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Strange, I can't reproduce that...

There is only one catch. It seems that the current WarpCTC supports variable-length inputs whereas cudnn7 only has the intention to support it. To elaborate, the current cudnn7 CTC API for getting workspace size looks like this:\r\n```\r\ncudnnStatus_t CUDNNWINAPI cudnnGetCTCLossWorkspaceSize(\r\n                                cudnnHandle_t                       handle,\r\n                                const cudnnTensorDescriptor_t       probsDesc,       /* Tensor descriptor for probabilities, the dimensions are T,N,A (T is the timing steps, N is the mini batch size, A is the alphabet size) */\r\n                                const cudnnTensorDescriptor_t       gradientsDesc,   /* Tensor descriptor for gradients, the dimensions are T,N,A. To compute costs only, set it to NULL */\r\n                                const int                          * labels,         /* labels, in CPU memory */\r\n                                const int                          * labelLengths,   /* the length of each label, in CPU memory */\r\n                                const int                          * inputLengths,   /* the lengths of timing steps in each batch, in CPU memory */\r\n                                cudnnCTCLossAlgo_t                  algo,            /* algorithm selected, supported now 0 and 1 */\r\n                                cudnnCTCLossDescriptor_t            ctcLossDesc,\r\n                                size_t                             *sizeInBytes );   /* pointer to the returned workspace size */\r\n```\r\nHowever, if I give any `*inputLengths` that is different from T, it throws an `CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM` error. Reading the doc, it has a note saying that this error is thrown if:\r\n```\r\n‣ The inputLengths do not agree with the first dimension of probsDesc.\r\n```\r\n...so my guess is that this argument is left there so that variable input lengths will be supported going forward, because asking for a list of Ts doesn't make much sense otherwise.\r\n\r\nBack to whether we should remove the WarpCTC implementation, I think we need to first clarify with cudnn team on when the `*inputLengths` can support variable input lengths, and remove the WarpCTC GPU implementation when that becomes available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/322308517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/322311423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7445#issuecomment-322311423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7445","id":322311423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjMxMTQyMw==","user":{"login":"sbodenstein","id":10237782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM3Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10237782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein","html_url":"https://github.com/sbodenstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-14T21:13:17Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T21:13:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, that is annoying!
