for explain. but i'm little bit confused.\nIf you are creating `LivyPySpark3Interpreter` in addition to `LivyPySparkInterpreter`, there will be no need to add property `zeppelin.livy.kind`.\n\nBut by adding a property, `LivyPySparkInterpreter` interpreter can read property and change it's behavior which version of python to use, in runtime. and no need to create `LivyPySpark3Interpreter`. \nIn this case, to use both python2 and python3 at the same time, user can create multiple interpreter settings in the GUI and use them.\n\nI have no strong opinion on any approaches, but at least `python`, `pyspark` interpreter handle python version using property instead of having separate interpreter class.\n\n@purechoc @zjffdu @prabhjyotsingh @felixcheung What do you

It always opens the default browser, however I develop in a different browser, so this is annoying as you can imagine\n2. Even if 1 wasn't the case, usually, I already have a tab prepared (often pinned) for development, but it would still open another one on grunt load.\n\nPerhaps, we need more discussion here. If people really want to keep it, we can.\n\n@1ambda\nLet me check the tests and I'll come back to you.\nGrunt serve is slower because it needs to process files with babel and copy them to a new dir. The old way was to serve from `src` directly, which we can't do now since we need to transpile. Hopefully, it will motivate us to move to webpack faster.\n\nAlso, adding webpack at this moment is non-trivial. I took a stab on it, but there is no easy way.
