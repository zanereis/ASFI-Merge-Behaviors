First of all, I'm not an expert on Flink so you can freely tell me where I might misunderstand it. I saw the `Flink113SqlInterpreter` and felt like `statementModeMap` is acting like a pair of `statementOperationMap`. I think we can change the logic like check if `statementOperationMap.get(context.getParagraphId()) == null` or not. If it's null, it look same as `statementModeMap.get(context.getParagraphId()) == false`. If it's true, we'd better remove `statementModeMap` and add logic to check nullability of `statmentOperationsMap.get(...) == null`. Am I correct? :-)\r\n> \r\n> Regardless of the opinion above, It looks good to me :-)\r\n\r\nYou are right @jongyoul  I have updated

Rest of them, I'm reading and will finish reviewing them by tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHi @jongyoul , thanks a lot for your reviews! I would resolve them.\r\n\r\n`MockRemoteStorageOperator` is a mock with the local file system to do real test for `OSSNotebookRepo`.  I think it is more sufficient than using `mockito`  and it did help me find some problem when running Github CI task.\r\n\r\nAdditionally  I introduce `RemoteStorageOpertor` because  I think the code in `NotebookRepo` should avoid underlying complex logic of storage operation.  By the way I think `RemoteStorageOpertor`  and `MockRemoteStorageOperator` may be also reused by other Network Storage NotebookRepo in the future.  Ideally,  we only need to implement `RemoteStorageOpertor`  instead of Network Storage NotebookRepo.

Do you have any plan to support old configuration in a new version? Otherwise, do users need to change it by hand?\r\n\r\nHi @jongyoul,  Old configuration is also supported in this PR. \r\nI am sorry to forget to add comments for the code. \r\nIf the string passed in doesn't include time unit,  method `timeUnitToMill`  would fail to parse and  return `-1`.  And the original code logic is then executed\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1125951606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1125981646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4368#issuecomment-1125981646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4368","id":1125981646,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5DHR3O","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T11:59:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T11:59:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@huage1994 Could you add unit test in ZeppelinConfigurationTest?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1125981646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1125990383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4368#issuecomment-1125990383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4368","id":1125990383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5DHT_v","user":{"login":"huage1994","id":8039295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8039295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994","html_url":"https://github.com/huage1994","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huage1994/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T12:10:44Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T13:15:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @huage1994 Could you add unit test in ZeppelinConfigurationTest?\r\n\r\nSure.
