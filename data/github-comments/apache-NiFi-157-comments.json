I've gone through all the code.\r\n> \r\n> * I think the changes for the Cosmos DB CS are good.\r\n> * I made some style suggestions around descriptions for the various property descriptors. In most cases it's to make the description a noun and to shorten things up.\r\n> * The current formatting is pretty aggressive on line lengths so I suggested some changes. It's ok to go over 80 but needs to be less than 200 to pass the checkstyle. I'd say you're ok not breaking lines until you're around 110 or 120 or so.\r\n> * I do have a question about why these are `*SecureCredentialsControllerService` and not `*KeyVaultCredentialsControllerService`.

In that case, it seems reasonable to maintain the current implementation with support for `-1`.

additional review of [RFC 7518 Section 8](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-8.3), I adjusted the signing algorithm to `PS512` instead of `RS512` in order to use `RSASSA-PSS` instead of `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5`. The Nimbus JWT library supports both algorithms and as a self-contained implementation, this provides better security for signing with the same RSA Key Pair approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/893981880/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/894290425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5274#issuecomment-894290425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5274","id":894290425,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41Tcn5","user":{"login":"gresockj","id":423565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzU2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/423565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj","html_url":"https://github.com/gresockj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gresockj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-06T14:13:14Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T14:13:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @emiliosetiadarma , now that NIFI-8696 is merged, can you please update the documentation in administration-guide.adoc?

I took a look at this again. Somehow, it did not occur to be before that `Bulletin` is in nifi-api. This means we have to be very careful about what we do here. We must maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nSo while I do think Bulletin should be immutable, we cannot make these changes until a 2.0 API. We can't remove methods like setters. So those changes need to be reverted. When these Bulletins are passed to a Reporting Task (I think that's the only extension point that has access to bulletins) it would probably make sense to wrap them in an `ImmutableBulletin` class that throws an Exception if any of the setters are called, because ReportingTasks are not intended to have the ability to modify existing Bulletins, only generate new ones.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we should not be storing a reference to the FlowFile in the bulletin. The JIRA indicates that we want the FlowFile UUID, and that's fair game to store there. But not the FlowFile itself. The FlowFile can potentially take up a huge amount of heap space if it has really large attributes (or tons of attributes).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/894340947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/894364945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5274#issuecomment-894364945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5274","id":894364945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41Tu0R","user":{"login":"emiliosetiadarma","id":51312775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzEyNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51312775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma","html_url":"https://github.com/emiliosetiadarma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emiliosetiadarma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-06T16:11:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T16:11:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @gresockj , will update the docs!

I wonder if it makes more sense to add all of the Parameters owned by the context you're looking at first (i.e., at the top in the UI) because you're most likely to want to see those first, since they are the ones you're updating? Not sure if this makes sense or not. Figured I'd mention it and get your thoughts on it.\r\n\r\nI like that idea -- I'll try it out and see how it feels.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also, there is code, it looks like, that allows for proper ordering of the parameter contexts so that they can be overridden. But once I ran the CLI command to set the inheritance, I couldn't create another Parameter to override. I.e., I created two Parameter Contexts: \"Kafka\" and \"S3\". I think created a \"Kafka to S3\" parameter context and made it inherit from both. The Kafka param context has a parameter named Brokers. I then tried to create a parameter named Brokers in the \"Kafka to S3\" context, in order to override the one in the \"Kafka\" context. I think this is intended to work. But when I tried to add it, I got back an error saying that a Parameter already exists with the name Brokers. I don't think this was intended, since it exists only in the inherited context. I think we should still allow it.\r\n\r\nGood find, this is the UI preventing the parameter from being added -- I'll add a check to allow parameters to be added if the existing one is inherited.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/894646358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/894714395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5294#issuecomment-894714395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5294","id":894714395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM41VEIb","user":{"login":"jfrazee","id":47344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-07T22:40:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-07T22:40:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@greyp9
