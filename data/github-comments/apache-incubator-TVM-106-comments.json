We could just do this for now, and later change it when the memory ships but I was thinking we should introduce a low level concept of storage independent from allocation of tensors.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn @f(%x, %y) {\r\n  let z = %x + %y;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn @f(%x, %y) {\r\n  let sto = alloc_storage(..);\r\n  let out1 = alloc_tensor(sto, ...);\r\n  add(%x, %y, %out1);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess we could have two low-level instruction variants which take storage, dtype and shape but in general I don't like specializing/duplicating as it increases the number of potential code paths, and the allocation mechanism should have no real differences afaict.

me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/501515008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/501515529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3352#issuecomment-501515529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3352","id":501515529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTUxNTUyOQ==","user":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-13T01:39:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T01:39:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Most
