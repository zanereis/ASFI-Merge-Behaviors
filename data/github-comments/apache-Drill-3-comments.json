to me this pull request would remove the common subexpression elimination(CSE) for Project and Filter only; it would not do CSE for other operators, like Join, Aggregation, Union, etc. \n\nI understand that the Union-type work would highly require CSE in Project/Filter. But will Union-type work would also require CSE in other operators? \n\nIf this JIRA only targets for Project/Filter, I think it would make sense to explicitly specify this scope in the JIRA. Otherwise, people would expect CSE would happen to all Drill's relation operator, which is not true.\n\nAnother question I have is : how easy is it to extend this patch to include CSE support for other operators?  I tried to enable CSE for all operators.

In this case, it sounds like we should go after bad logging rather than removing information from errors. \nHaving \"verbose errors\" will actually enable less logging:\nCurrently the server side (drillbit) stack trace is lost when the exception goes through the RPC layer. Which means we rely on logging those errors on the server side to find the original stack trace.\nthe \"verbose errors\" setting will add the stacktrace in the exception message so that we get both the client and server side stacktrace from the client side exception. which would allow removing the server side logging in tests.\n\nI think we should follow this general principle: If an exception is dealt with it should not be logged. Only exception that can not be dealt with should be logged as errors or warning depending on the effect.\nA negative test would catch an exception and verify it.
