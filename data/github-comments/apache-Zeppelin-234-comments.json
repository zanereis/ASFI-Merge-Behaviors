Spark hardcoding `SPARK_HOME` to `/opt/spark` and `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` to `/opt/hadoop/conf` in docker image and Spark on K8s cases, so far it works well.\r\n\r\nI don't see any potential issues on hardcoding the `ZEPPELIN_HOME` inside the docker image, since docker already provides good isolation, to make life easier, I think we can do similar things too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2288889661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2288984651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4792#issuecomment-2288984651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4792","id":2288984651,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM6IbyJL","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-14T14:41:09Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T14:41:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If

We need to mitigate `zeppelin-interpreter` dependency. Currently, `zeppelin-interpreter` is quite big and has a lot of other dependencies unrelated to interpreters.\r\n\r\nI fully agree with that, and I also noticed the packaging time for `zeppelin-interpreter-shaded` is pretty slow due to a lot of classes needing to be relocated, and some of those deps come from ZEPPELIN-3471, I have raised a [thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/vm2m4xg6bg0db33txrrm9ydd15dqy1lx) to remove it in the dev mailing list, please leave your comments to help the community make the decision.\r\n\r\n> Interpreters needing communication can add `zeppelin-protocol` as a dependency. \r\n\r\nTo address the above issue, I think we should separate the optional dependencies into individual modules, then we can eliminate them in some interpreters, but is `zeppelin-protocol` that case?

However, it was because we only provide all functions within the zeppelin-interpreter module.

In this PR, will we permanently change the default web to a new one? I intended to release two versions with an old and new UI separately. After releasing 0.12.0 with those manners we can try to change the default UI for the 0.13.0 release in my understanding.
