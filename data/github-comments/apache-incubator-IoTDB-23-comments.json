everyone!\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I didn't have success to show the `TOTAL_POINTS` stats.\r\n\r\nFirst I tried to run a Docker container from master but got this error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused \"exec: \\\"/iotdb/sbin/start-server.sh\\\": stat /iotdb/sbin/start-server.sh: no such

version 0.11.1 released recently. This time I was able to run the CLI and run commands but I still can't see any stats besides `WAL` and `SYS`.\r\n\r\nDockerfile:\r\n```\r\nFROM openjdk:11-jre-slim\r\nRUN apt update \\\r\n  # procps

set:\r\n```\r\nenable_stat_monitor=true\r\nenable_monitor_series_write=true\r\nenable_performance_stat=true\r\nenable_performance_tracing=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the link for the complete iotdb-properties.conf: https://pastebin.com/CT7PUNpE.\r\n\r\nI tried running all the commands below but no stats besides `WAL` and `SYS` are available in the timeseries.\r\n\r\n```\r\nset storage group to root.ln\r\n\r\ncreate timeseries root.ln.wf02.wt02.status with datatype=BOOLEAN,encoding=RLE\r\ncreate timeseries root.ln.wf02.wt02.temperature with datatype=FLOAT,encoding=RLE\r\n\r\ninsert

additional details:\r\n- I executed `FLUSH` before trying to get the stats but I still can't see anything.\r\n- Other commands I executed:\r\n```\r\nselect TOTAL_POINTS from root.stats.\"global\"\r\nselect TOTAL_POINTS from root.stats.\"root.ln\"\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/743801371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/743943035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2258#issuecomment-743943035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/2258","id":743943035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Mzk0MzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-13T03:36:26Z","updated_at":"2020-12-13T03:36:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please

However I didn't see any reject exception.\r\n\r\nThere may be a reason that the default JVM memory size of IoTDB only use 1/4 of physical memory size, which should be 2GB on your machine as you described before.  If you would like to change it, you can modify the `MAX_HEAP_SIZE` in `iotdb-env.sh`. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is another config you could change, which is `primitive_array_size` in `iotdb-engine.properties`. You may modify the number smaller like 32.\r\n\r\nOr their is another solution, but not a good one, if you like to try. Set `enable_mem_control` to false, set `memtable_size_threshold` to 15000000. If you do this, there won't be any reject exception thrown. \r\n\r\nBy the way, we are working on the improvement of memory control strategy now. Your feedback does provide us a great case to do this research. Thank you so much again!
