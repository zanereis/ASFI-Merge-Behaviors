Thank you for your interest in this feature and your advice!\r\n\r\nSo for, the feedback received is more in favor of Solution I (modified based on existing nodes), but **I think Solution II (adding new node type) would be more suitable for DS**. I will discuss why I think the second solution is more suitable from the following two aspects.\r\n\r\n- Functionality (From basic functions and long-term plans)\r\n- Cost (From users and developers)\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\n### Basic Functions\r\n\r\nIn order to choose a solution properly, in my opinion, the baseline is reaching the basic functions. The goal of blocking task is that in the execution process in a workflow, **if encountered blocking task and the task met blocking requirements, the whole workflow should have been paused, otherwise, continued.**\r\n\r\nObviously, **two of solutions will reach that goal.** In addition, in some sicuation, solution II will be better than solution I. Let me show you.\r\n\r\n>  Suppose your boss have a demond. There is a blocking task in workflow. And there are three independent sub_processes in front of the blocking task. Now, your boss tells you that if any two of the three sub_processes run successfully, the workflow continue, or else, pause.\r\n\r\nIf I choose solution I, I will use condition node.  In the current version of condition node, I must have two branches, one for  success, one for failure, and two branch must be different. For completing the blocking task, **I must have a useless branch** (echo helloword in shell for example ) to meet my boss requirement. Maybe you will consider to modify current condition node, but I think it is not suitable. Because you **break the condition node function** which is used to turn the workflow into the user expected direction.\r\n\r\nIf I choose solution II, everything becomes easy. As for this new type of node (Let me call it blocking node), we do not have limitations. This node has logic judgement function and it can support one successor branch or multi-successors branchs. In this way, **it does not destroy the functionality of existing nodes and accomplishes our blocking goal.**\r\n\r\n### Long-term plans\r\n\r\nIn solution I, blocking task is **used as a special node attribute**. If one day, Apache releases a new bigdata component and DS wants to support it, we still need to add the blocking option when coding related web pages. But in solution II, put things right once and for all.\r\n\r\n## Cost\r\n\r\n### User\r\n\r\nTo be honest, the user cost is similar in both solutions. User will know what blocking task is and how to setup. @simsicon says that solution II will cause the modification of DAG. Actually, neithor solution I or solution II needs to modify the DAG, but the degree is different.\r\n\r\n### Developer\r\n\r\nCoding in solution II maybe harder. But I believe that is worthy. Beacuse solution II is more flexiable and competent than solution I, just like I menthoned in the above sicuation.  For another instance, Apple releases iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 2021. iPad Air 4 (256GB) sales 749 dollars and iPad Pro (128GB, 11 inch) sales 749 dollars. They differ by $50. But with that extra money you can enjoy the ultimate iPad experience while meeting your daily needs, why not pay that extra price? Blocking task is the same.\r\n\r\nIn conclution, I think solution II is better.\r\n\r\nWelcome to express your opinion!\r\n\r\n## <a id='zh-ch'>概览</a>\r\n\r\n*首先感谢社区小伙伴[@simsicon](https://github.com/simsicon)  、[@dailidong](https://github.com/dailidong)、[@Jave-Chen](https://github.com/Jave-Chen)、@shaojwu对本特性的关注，感谢你们为本提案提供意见！*\r\n\r\n虽然根据目前收到的反馈，赞成Solution I（基于现有节点修改的）会多一些，但是综合考虑，**我觉得Solution II（新增节点类型）会更适合DS**，我会从以下两个方面论述为什么我觉得第二个方案更合适。\r\n\r\n- 功能性方面（基础功能、长远打算）\r\n- 成本方面（用户成本、开发者成本）\r\n\r\n## 功能性方面\r\n\r\n### 基础功能\r\n\r\n衡量一个方案，最最基本的，我认为是功能要达到我们的预期。阻断功能的目标是：在工作流执行过程中，如果遇到阻断任务，且满足用户设定的阻断条件，那么**工作流就暂停执行**，通知用户干预；如果不满足阻断条件，就继续执行。\r\n\r\n很显然，**两种方案都能够达到这个基本目标**。但是，对于第二种方案来说，第一种方案能做的，它可以做，且可以做得更好！试考虑以下场景：\r\n\r\n>  一天老板提了一个需求，要求我在工作流的中设置一个阻断任务，它的上游有3个分支，对应3个独立的子流程，这个阻断任务需要检查上游3个任务的运行情况，其中任意两个任务检查通过就可以继续执行（后续是单分支的），否则需要对工作流进行暂停。\r\n\r\n如果使用方案一，我必然要使用条件节点，但是目前DS中的条件节点，成功分支和失败分支都需要设置，且它们必须不一样，这样DAG才可以保存。我为了实现这个阻断任务，**我必须建立一个无用的分支**（例如使用Shell输出一个hello world）来满足需求。你可能会考虑修改条件节点，让其只有一个分支的情况下才能保存，但是我认为这么做**破坏了条件节点进行分支流转的功能**。\r\n\r\n如果使用方案二，一切就变得简单了，对于这个新增节点（我们暂且叫它阻断节点吧），我们就没有这个限制了，这个节点具有逻辑判断功能，我既可以让阻断节点支持后继多分支，也可以支持单分支（待研究）。这么做，**即不会破坏现有节点的功能，又完成了我们的阻断目标**。\r\n\r\n### 长远打算\r\n\r\n从长远来看，第一种方案，相当于把阻断任务当作了节点的属性进行**捆绑**。假如有一天Apache又发布了一款大数据组件，DS想要支持，在新节点前端编写的时候，依然需要增设阻断的选项。但是使用方案二，就不会存在捆绑问题，一劳永逸，且节点之间各司其职。\r\n\r\n## 成本方面\r\n\r\n### 用户成本\r\n\r\n用户成本的话，老实说，两个方案用户成本都差不多。用户都要认识什么是阻断任务，如何去设置阻断任务。[@simsicon](https://github.com/simsicon) 有在issue中提到使用方案二导致的DAG修改问题，其实不论哪一种方案，DAG都是需要一定程度的修改，只不过是修改程度上的区别。\r\n\r\n### 开发成本\r\n\r\n老实说，预估第二种方案的代码量会比第一种多一些，**但是我觉得这是值得的**。因为第二种方案相比第一种更加灵活，能够更好地完成阻断任务。就好像苹果推出了iPad air 4和iPad Pro 2021，iPad air 4 256GB售价749美元， iPad Pro 2021

the question**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the improvement is.\r\n\r\n**What are the current deficiencies and the benefits of improvement**\r\n-[Current Node Settings] field \"Run ID\" is changed to \"Node Status\", and the option value is changed to [\"Enable\", \"Disable\"], which is more intuitive.\r\n-[Current Node Settings] field \"Failure Retry Times\", \"Failure Retry Interval\", \"Timeout Alarm\", \"Alarm Strategy\", \"Timeout Duration\" and extract it to [Current Node Settings] to create a new TAB page to place, name Can be \"execution strategy\" (similar to the write and preview effects of filling in the issue). Taking timeout as an example, you can place a drop-down box on the execution strategy page, add a timeout strategy, and display the current related options as a GROUP. This can separate the node definition from the execution strategy and make it clearer. No policy is attached by default. At the same time, in addition to timeout, you can also define a notification strategy for execution success/failure (different notification methods can be defined in this strategy). In my actual use process, sometimes it is necessary to notify in real time when TASK fails or succeeds, instead of notifying until DAG level or overtime.\r\n-[System Variables] Add DAG-related system variables, such as dag name, currently executing task name, worker node IP, execution time, error message and other general ones. It can be very accurate when receiving system notifications for problem location.\r\n-[Resource Management] It is recommended to make the file management and UDF management pages into a tree structure, and the tree nodes can add/delete/move folders. Support batch upload of files. It's too painful to only upload a single file now.\r\n\r\n中文在这：\r\n- [当前节点设置] 字段“运行标识”改为“节点状态”，选项值变更为[“启用”，“禁用”]，更直观。\r\n- [当前节点设置] 字段“失败重试次数”，“失败重试间隔”，“超时告警”，“告警策略”，“超时时长”提取到[当前节点设置]新建一个TAB页去放置，名称可为“执行策略”（类似于填写issue的write与preview效果）。以超时举例，可在执行策略页面放置一个下拉框，添加超时策略，将当前相关选项做为一个GROUP进行展示。这样可以把节点定义与执行策略分离，更加清晰。默认情况下不附加任何策略。 同时除了超时，还可以定义执行成功/失败的通知策略（此策略中就可定义不同的通知方式）。我在实际使用过程中，有时候是需要在TASK失败或成功时实时通知，而不是到DAG级别或超时才通知。 \r\n- [系统变量] 增加DAG相关的系统变量，例如 dag名称,当前执行的task名称,worker节点IP，执行时间，出错信息  等这些通用的。在接收到系统通知进行问题定位时可以非常精准。\r\n-

Find the class in questions and check whether the entry has a link to the corresponding coverage report page. If the entry is not linked this means there is a class id mismatch between the class used at runtime and the class provided to create the report. —— [How can I detect that I have a problem with class ids?](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/classids.html)\r\n\r\n![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49934421/125169241-db674e00-e1db-11eb-89c4-e7820dead48d.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the figure below, The `Demo` class is not linked to the corresponding coverage report page.
