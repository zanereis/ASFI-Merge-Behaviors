This can avoid the overhead of processing the predicate for each segment. Since the `FilterContext` won't be changed, we should be able to use the identity map to store the mapping from `Predicate` to the pre-computed values\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a good idea that would be interesting for future improvements. Would you modify the expression tree or store these values in a map indexed by the actual value in the expression tree? The later case has the advantage that we can lazily do that only when it is actually needed and it would be quite easy to implement.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not sure about the priority of these changes. JFR metrics taken with the benchmarks show that most of the time is spent in `DataSource dataSource = dataSourceCache.computeIfAbsent(column, segment::getDataSource);`. In case we still want to focus on improve the performance of this class, I think we should focus on how to make getDataSource faster. Specifically, `ImmutableSegmentImpl` should be able to cache these values. I don't know the codebase that well, but it seems that these datasources are going to be immutable, are relative expensive to be created, and are used several times during the lifecycle of a `ImmutableSegmentImpl`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136857476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136938560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8771#issuecomment-1136938560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8771","id":1136938560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DxE5A","user":{"login":"lksvenoy-r7","id":46895578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODk1NTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46895578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7","html_url":"https://github.com/lksvenoy-r7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lksvenoy-r7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T08:19:15Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T08:19:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Need to make some other changes.. closing PR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136938560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1136989214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8772#issuecomment-1136989214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8772","id":1136989214,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5DxRQe","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T09:05:45Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T10:13:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8772?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8772](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8772?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (78fa349) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/d4c99abe7240e3a2c24958d6de246a73d7558b7d?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (d4c99ab) will **decrease** coverage by `1.18%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 78fa349 differs from pull request most recent head eb33868.

I ran the benchmark in both phases. Taking into consideration what @richardstartin said about IdentityHashMap, I ran these tests twice: One using the IdentityHashMap and another one using a normal HashMap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit, V2, tries to apply what @Jackie-Jiang suggested about not only cache the hashes but also the converted values and instead of doing that lazily, just eagerly do that while the expression is visited during the prepare phase. This implies that the key used in the cache is a `Predicate`, not the `literals`. I also had to break the safe compatibility, because the value of the EQ operators is a single `CachedValue` but the value of the IN operator is a list of them. I could create two maps instead, but I didn't like that solution either. Which one would you prefer? Do you have another solution in mind?\r\n\r\nThe second commit, V3, has a bigger impact (it cuts the cost by a half!). The idea here is to add a cache of DataSource in ImmutableSegment. It is clear in the flamegraphs created from the benchmark that a lot of time was spent trying to calculate this value. It makes a lot of sense, as there are a lot of segments and we need to create a new instance for each one. In fact the instance creation is quite expensive not because it has to generate memory, but due to the fact that the columns used as keys are different strings that has the same content. This force HashMap to calculate compare them by equals, which is relative expensive when the operation itself is in the order of microseconds.\r\n\r\nIn the benchmark each segment is read tons of times, so having the DataSource cached on all executions but the first is a huge advantage. In a Pinot Server that condition should also be true and the improvement should applicable to other methods that heavily use `getDataSource()`. As I said in another comment, I'm not sure about the correctness of this change. It seems correct but I would like the confirmation from someone else that knows the codebase.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the benchmark are the following:\r\n\r\nBefore any change:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                           (_numRows)  (_numSegments)  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkServerSegmentPruner.query          10              10  avgt    5   1.426 ± 0.003  us/op\r\nBenchmarkServerSegmentPruner.query          10             100  avgt    5  14.719 ± 1.342  us/op\r\nBenchmarkServerSegmentPruner.query          10            1000  avgt    5  174.879 ± 5.115  us/op\r\n```\r\nV1 (yesterday):\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                           (_numRows)  (_numSegments)  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkServerSegmentPruner.query          10              10  avgt    5   0.972 ± 0.003  us/op\r\nBenchmarkServerSegmentPruner.query          10             100  avgt    5  10.149 ± 0.046  us/op\r\nBenchmarkServerSegmentPruner.query          10            1000  avgt    5  135.063 ± 14.670  us/op\r\n```\r\nV2\r\n```\r\nV2 with HashMap\r\nBenchmark                                (_numRows)  (_numSegments)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10              10  avgt    5    1.325 ± 0.029  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10             100  avgt    5   12.851 ± 0.171  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10            1000  avgt    5  138.314 ± 2.238  us/op\r\n\r\nV2 with IdentityHashMap\r\nBenchmark                                (_numRows)  (_numSegments)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10              10  avgt    5    1.110 ± 0.001  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10             100  avgt    5   10.659 ± 0.139  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10            1000  avgt    5  120.608 ± 0.159  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nV3\r\n```\r\nV3 with HashMap\r\nBenchmark                                (_numRows)  (_numSegments)  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10              10  avgt    5   0.971 ± 0.003  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10             100  avgt    5   4.843 ± 0.045  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10            1000  avgt    5  72.658 ± 0.735  us/op\r\n\r\nV3 with IdentityHashMap\r\nBenchmark                                (_numRows)  (_numSegments)  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10              10  avgt    5   0.556 ± 0.001  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10             100  avgt    5   4.964 ± 0.268  us/op\r\nBenchmarkColumnValueSegmentPruner.query          10            1000  avgt    5  58.304 ± 0.382  us/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot print them all in a single JMH execution because each one requires to do some modifications in the code.

This would result in only ever allocating one new list since the last two pruners are mutually exclusive, which is the best this change could achieve.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1139467789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1139559652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8632#issuecomment-1139559652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8632","id":1139559652,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5D7Ezk","user":{"login":"stym06","id":20970728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTcwNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20970728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06","html_url":"https://github.com/stym06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stym06/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T12:11:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T12:11:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang In case of `1:HOURS:SIMPLE_DATE_FORMAT:yyyy-MM-dd tz(America/Chicago)` what will be equivalent in the new format?

This is the stack trace I saw while attempting to generate a very large index (2GB+). This was more of a test rather than a production usecase, so we don't really need the limit to be increased, but if it can be done easily then no harm.

Can you please check the log and see if there is any ERROR log that indicate the segment commit is failing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1143890185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1143908580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8800#issuecomment-1143908580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8800","id":1143908580,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5ELqjk","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T17:22:36Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T17:22:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think I get the general idea of using inverted index to solve distinct and group-by queries:\r\n- SELECT DISTINCT colA FROM myTable WHERE ...\r\n- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTable WHERE ... GROUP BY colA\r\n\r\nWhen the colA has inverted index, we can scan all the bitmaps to solve the query instead of scanning the matching docs. \r\n\r\nIt might be able to accelerate the query when the following conditions are met:\r\n- `colA` has low cardinality (we don't want to scan too many bitmaps)\r\n- Filter has low selectivity (lots of records matched, so scanning cost is relatively high)\r\n\r\nNote that when `colA` has low cardinality, the current approach won't be very costly. We'll maintain a small set/map on dictionary ids of up to cardinality size. Scanning the bitmaps is not strictly O(cardinality) complexity because processing each bitmap can be up to O(number of rows). We should evaluate and find the break even point for this optimization to out-perform the current solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1143908580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1144012826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8641#issuecomment-1144012826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8641","id":1144012826,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5EMEAa","user":{"login":"kkrugler","id":66217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler","html_url":"https://github.com/kkrugler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T18:51:38Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T18:51:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@npawar @Jackie-Jiang - just created https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8812 as first step (\"Track all the failed segments into a list, but keep the task running.
