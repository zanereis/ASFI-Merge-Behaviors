Once those conflicts are resolved and when this passes the builds, then this looks good to me, and I'm happy to merge it ASAP - let's still get this into release 1.4.0! @Sanyam96 @awasum  does this have LGTM from you guys as well, as-is?\r\n\r\nPS: One thing I would love to understand better, and I'm sure others would like to as well, is how this will actually be used? I'm sure to you this is \"obvious\", but to all those of us who have not been involved in the details this GSOC project, would it be possible to have some \"doc\" for this? It doesn't matter if initially it's given here or in [FINERACT-733](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-733) or may be somewhere on the Apache Confluence Wiki. Just to understand, once we merge this, what does this actually \"do\" - you know what I mean? I gather these two new Gradle plugins you are adding ([io.swagger.core.v3.swagger-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-gradle-plugin) and [org.hidetake.swagger.generator](https://github.com/int128/gradle-swagger-generator-plugin)) do... what - just generate the src/main/resources/swagger-ui/response.json file? Can I ask why we need 2 plugins to generate 1 file? :smiling_imp: Or do these to more\r\n\r\nI can see that file already exists now, but I'm not clear where that's coming from, and how it was initially built.. does someone else know? @vishwasbabu or @Sanyam96 perhaps? Is that this PR contributes, in essence, really the automatic build of that file?\r\n\r\nIf that new src/main/resources/swagger-ui/response.json file is (now) a generated artifact, then why is it in Git, and generated under src/ instead of just being put in the right place under build/ so that it ends up in the WAR?

I have resolved the conflicts. \r\n\r\nThe response.json file is the OpenAPI specification file which is used to generate the swagger-ui. \r\nThe already existing response.json file in src/main/resources/swagger-ui/ is the spec generated with the request https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api/v1/swagger.json. Every time a modification is done on the swagger docs or a new swagger doc is added, this spec needs to be generated again at runtime and the response.json file as well updated so that the modifications can be seen on the UI. \r\n\r\nThe io.swagger.core.v3.swagger-gradle-plugin is a plugin i had added to automatically generate the specs during build time and not at run time. This was so that every time one builds on the project, the response.json updates. But this did not work as expected. I had removed the plugin from the build script. I am wondering how its still in there. probably while i have rebasing and resolving conflicts, that came back in the script. I will remove the plugin. \r\n\r\nThe other plugin org.hidetake.swagger.generator is used to generate code from the openAPI spec file using swagger-codegen. So this does not generate response.json. It rather uses response.json to generate client code. You\r\n\r\n@vorburger i think you have a nice idea. Is it possible to get the file and the swagger-ui in the war? \r\nThat is actually what is needed to be done. Presently the file is manually generated and updated each time.
