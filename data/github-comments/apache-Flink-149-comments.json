@fhueske, @wuchong \r\n\r\nI think we can solve the problem with current `TableSource` class hierarchy in a different way. If we remove all abstract classes and move all default implementations in `TableSource` trait it will make class hierarchy much simpler. The only drawback of this is that Java users will need to provide implementations of trait methods that explicitly [call default implementations](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7637888).\r\n\r\nI don't think this bad since it's a common way to extend Scala traits. We can additionally remove `getFieldNames` and `getFieldIndices` if you think they are superfluous.

Even if we remove these two methods from the `TableSource` trait interface there is still `getTypeIndices` method and Java users will have to call it if they are going to implement a `TableSource` trait.

We will have to rely on reflection tricks (probably sugared with pattern matching) while we simply having three methods is more clean OO solution.\r\n\r\nWhat if we leave all three methods and simply add some base Java implementations that already implement these traits?

thanks for the review @twalthr! I fixed the code for most of the comments. I will fix the tests at this weekend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270986138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270993595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3057#issuecomment-270993595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3057","id":270993595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk5MzU5NQ==","user":{"login":"EronWright","id":1775518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzU1MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1775518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright","html_url":"https://github.com/EronWright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EronWright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T20:07:54Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T20:07:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen yes, this PR does the following:\r\n1. isolate the configuration of kerberos credentials from how those credentials are used\r\n2. modularize the security code to reflect the independent aspects of configuring Hadoop vs. JAAS based on the credential.\r\n3. make explicit as to which JAAS login contexts are provided the cluster's credential\r\n4. incorporate the user-supplied JAAS (to satisfy the MapR scenario)\r\n5. update `config.md` and `internals/security.md`\r\n\r\nThe main user impact is that one must explicitly share the credential with specific contexts - the 'KafkaClient' login context, ZooKeeper 'Client' context, etc, based on whether the corresponding service is kerberized.  Earlier we had tried to always share the credential to all JAAS contexts, but this caused problems.     \r\n\r\nWith this patch, I believe the design goal is met of allowing Kerberos to be independently enabled for any external connection.  For example, a Kerberized Kafka + a non-Kerberized Hadoop is a valid scenario.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270993595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/270994199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3057#issuecomment-270994199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3057","id":270994199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk5NDE5OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T20:10:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T20:10:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@EronWright Thanks for explaining.

Whether an exception is caused by client or server is indicated by `AmazonServiceException#getErrorType()` which returns either `ErrorType.Client`, `ErrorType.Server`, or `ErrorType.Unknown`\r\n\r\nSo, instead of simply catching a `AmazonServiceException`, I wonder if we should only perform exponential backoff for service exceptions with `Server` and `Unknown` error types.
