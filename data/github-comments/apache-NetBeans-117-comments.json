Glad that everything is working now. Jave 8 (1.8) is getting really old, many features are not backported. Technically NetBeans only supports 11 and up. \r\n\r\nBut there is no good reason from an user perspective to use an old java version, so sticking with 17 or later is a good decision to get the best experience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1160555797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1160579279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4251#issuecomment-1160579279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4251","id":1160579279,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5FLQjP","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-20T15:21:32Z","updated_at":"2022-06-20T15:21:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"what do you need that update for?

netbeans \r\n```\r\n\r\nClear the repository and the external cache of all downloaded files before each test with the commands:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ rm -r ~/.hgexternalcache/*\r\n$ git clean -xdf \r\n```\r\n\r\nSet one, both, or none of the standard proxy environment variables as appropriate for each specific test, as in the following example:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ export https_proxy=http://10.10.10.1:8222/\r\n$ export http_proxy=http://10.10.10.1:8222/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run Ant with the target `download-all-extbins`, which downloads 564 files into the repository

And how does this scheme work in the sidebar to the left, which is usually inactive?\r\n\r\nAgreed.  It might be too much.  But either we need background colour contrast or possibly make a border (like in your changes) across the whole tab top, in the accent colour when focused.  Compare with eg. Thunderbird and Aqua LAF screenshots you shared earlier, then with VSCode one.  I tried two different greys, depending on focus, so inactive are slightly darker - all ViewTab settings set to same named EditorTab setting.  Maybe focus remains slightly accent coloured as it is now.  I'll try a tweak tomorrow and share.\r\n\r\n> There are a few less controversial changes in this PR as well, such as .. adjusting the vertical height\r\n\r\nPersonally, using a QHD desktop and sometimes a small FHD laptop, one reason I prefer FlatLaf over other LAFs is because the tabs are a usable size.  I understand why on other systems, the size might be a problem.  I think perhaps considering a compact UI setting might be way to go here - like toolbar icon sizing but broader - not sure there is a one size fits all solution (pun intended! :smile:)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1166492331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1166519822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4232#issuecomment-1166519822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4232","id":1166519822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Fh64O","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-26T12:37:34Z","updated_at":"2022-06-26T12:37:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I intent to merge this next week.
