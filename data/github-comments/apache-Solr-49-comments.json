There are some caveats and things to be figured out, like the `onnxruntime_gpu` versus `onnxruntime` issue.   Based on my work so far, we definitly need tutorials, there are too many moving pieces.   The PackageStore is great, at least as far as I've worked with it, but it does expect to load the data in memory as it moves it around, so we need to figure that out.   Right now we only get sentiment labels back, and we really need sentiment scores, i.e a number.  I don't know if that can be a 0 to 1, of if it has to be 1,2,3,4,5 labels.   I'd like to experiment with the saem thing as a copyField into a text analyzer, so you copy \"review\" into \"review_sentiment_score\" and get a number there.

They were just forwarded to the CREATE core command. Same for the ADDREPLICA command, `property.*` parameters were only forwarded to the CREATE core command. Hence possible inconsistencies, if one passes a custom property when creating a collection, but not later on when adding a replica.\r\n\r\nThis PR really adds two things:\r\n1. Persist `property.*` parameters in state.json for collections and replicas (I did not tackle shards).\r\n2. Propagate those custom properties in ADDREPLICA calls to make sure that cores are created in a consistent way with the same properties. New cores inherit from properties from both the collection and replica, the latter overwriting properties from the former if they are found in both. This is of course only possible because they are stored in state.json.\r\n\r\nPlease note that adding custom properties to collections and replicas is already supported via MODIFYCOLLECTION (**not** COLLECTIONPROP) and ADDREPLICAPROP commands, but this has no effect other than persisting them. Now, if those existing commands are used after creating a collection or replica, they would have the effect of affecting properties passed to new cores (but that would **never** change existing cores, their properties are immutable I guess).\r\n\r\nI hope this proposal brings one piece of answer to similar concerns raised about this in

Do we envision having non-cloud container-level plugins, as this PR opens the way to?

As I'm sure you know, Solr runs in standalone and has a solr.xml and there are already specific named plugins that work there.  These are \"node plugins\", albeit of a specific expected type for a specific purpose.  Like CoresLocator, which I think you are familiar with :-). All classes in NodeConfig/solr.xml are a \"node plugin\" by virtue of a pluggable class specified in this spot.  You are generalizing this to have more for more general purposes.

It is a bucket because it is used to lock operations of all the doc IDs which hash falls into this bucket.\r\nSecond, it keeps the highest version which is the max of the versions of the docs in the bucket. This is an optimization only when the leader forwards the update request to another replica (there could be an option to not store this long if only the leader updates and never forwards). When updating a doc with version v, to compare first with the highest version vh of the bucket. If v > vh, then we know the doc version is ordered, without having to look in the transaction log or index for the precise indexed doc version.\r\n\r\nWhy 65536 VersionBucket?\r\nFor both VersionBucket goals, the more buckets there are, the more precise is the locking (for perf) and the highest version optimization. The drawback is the memory usage.\r\nIn SOLR-6820, the number of buckets was studied. If there are not enough buckets, it happens that update threads are blocked waiting on the same bucket lock when an update operation takes a long time. With a large number of buckets, the probability of threads locking the same bucket, within the duration of a long operation, is sufficiently low to not impact perf.\r\n\r\nCan we manage buckets dynamically?\r\nFor the locking aspect, yes, but there is more synchronization required if we support bucket removal. If we only support lazy creation, we only need to synchronize when creating a bucket.\r\nFor the highest version optimization, partially, we cannot remove the highest value if it is different than the common \"seed\" value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1768027856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1768115201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2012#issuecomment-1768115201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2012","id":1768115201,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5pY0wB","user":{"login":"bruno-roustant","id":33934988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTM0OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33934988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant","html_url":"https://github.com/bruno-roustant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bruno-roustant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T10:05:54Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T10:05:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Alex for the review and questions.
