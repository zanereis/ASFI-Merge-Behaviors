Just some thoughts when I was reading the code. I think \"Message\" (and \"Record\" in the new clients) are a well established concept for Kafka. It is indeed a little weird that `Records` is an `Iterable<LogEntry>`, but I felt changing all the `Reocrds` to `LogBuffer` seems introducing a new concept (BTW `FileLogBuffer` sounds a little weird given it actually does not have a buffer). I would like to see if we can avoid solving the confusion by adding a new concept.\r\n\r\nNot sure if there was any thinking on changing `LogEntry` to something like `LogRecord` which indicate it's something resides in the log? Then `Records` would contain a few `LogRecord` which contains (`Offset` + `Record`). We also have a pretty symmetric naming for `ProducerRecord`, `ConsumerRecord` and `LogRecord` clearly indicating where they are used. We can also consider renaming `Records` to `LogRecords` to make it clear. I am not sure if `Records` counts as a public interface or not, though. I know we have a page stating which packages are public and which are not, but I doubt if people follows that given we have an explicit `internals` package...\r\n\r\nI'll save my other comments until I go through a full pass of the code in case some of them are not valid at all (I already found some...)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261860811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/261887880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2140#issuecomment-261887880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2140","id":261887880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTg4Nzg4MA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T09:32:06Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T09:32:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@becketqin, that's a fair point about the rename and introducing a new concept.

I'm not sure I follow why you consider the renaming a conceptual change. The object works the same as before, but I felt the name fit closer to what the object actually represents, which is a range of bytes from the log. The name `Records` to me just suggests a container for `Record` objects.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion about `LogRecord` makes sense to me. I have actually done something similar in work building off of this patch. At the same time, I would like to preserve a concept of `LogEntry` as a container for records which sits between `LogBuffer` (or `Records`) and `LogRecord` (or `Record`). The basic idea is to treat the shallow messages as log entries, and the deep messages as log records (an uncompressed message is treated as a log entry containing just a single log record). \r\n\r\nTo give a bit more background, we're trying to generalize the concept of a message set so that 1) it uses a separate schema from individual messages, and 2) it's extended to uncompressed data. This allows us to amortize the cost of additional metadata which is invariant for the messages contained in a message set. I'm happy to provide some additional detail if you're interested (there will be a KIP on the way some time in the next few weeks).\r\n\r\n@onurkaraman Yeah, we can do that if it makes this patch easier to get in.

I would assume, this does solve your inital problem?\r\n\r\n@mjsax I'm aware of [KIP-71](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-71%3A+Enable+log+compaction+and+deletion+to+co-exist), but as @dguy said, it's only for windowded stores, but I'm having several other toplogies (streams apps), that are using left join, which is backed by a regular KV RocksDB state store. In those cases also, I don't need state store data forever - usually depends on the use case, but right now I'm having use cases where I need retention of 5 hours and 48 hours respectively.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, it is possible (trunk only, will be part of 0.10.2) to plug a custom state store within DSL: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3825\r\n\r\nThat's great news, this will surely help Kafka Streams users to have more choices regarding their particular needs, for example, some use cases don't need so fast processing, and you could use a regular company database for \"local state\". One great thing about custom state stores, is that you could chain RocksDB for relatively new messages, and have a fallback to a company database - for late arriving messages. With this you could tune you processing latency and storage requirements depending on the use case.\r\n\r\n> If we were to use the TtLDB we'd also need to know when an entry expires so that we can send key:null to the compacted topic.\r\n\r\n@dguy are you sure about that? That would mean that you would delete data from Kafka topic, based on some streams app use cases. Let's imagine that that you have two streams apps that have different use cases, but they use the same topic.\r\n_App1_\r\n_App2_\r\nshared topic name: _inventory_\r\nIn _App1_ you do a left join to the topic _inventory_ - a new KV state store is created which is backed by this same topic _inventory_. In this app you configure `rocksdb.ttl.sec` because you don't need all the data all the time in the state store.\r\nIn _App2_ you do use _inventory_ as a stream, for every change, you apply some bussiness logic.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, _App1_ specific use case and it's storage requirements would cause data to be deleted from a topic _inventory_ that maybe you don't won't to be deleted.\r\n\r\n> Nevertheless, you PR could still get merger.

I am just wondering, if we might want to allow to add TTL for current RocksDB store (disabled by default). Not sure what the performance impact would be. Would assume that there is a good reason for using TtlTD.\r\n\r\n@dguy \r\n> If we were to use the TtLDB we'd also need to know when an entry expires so that we can send key:null to the compacted topic.\r\n\r\nIf we know the TTL, we can sent tombstone \"independently\" of TtlDB, IMHO. I don't see a strong reason why we want to delete both at the exact some time? Deleting from changelog a little latter would also be ok, IMHO. A TTL is always a minimum duration a record is kept -- if we kept it a little longer in the changelog that should not be a problem. In recovery case, we only need to make sure to not reread old (ie, already expired) record that got not yet deleted back into TtlDB.\r\n\r\n@dpoldrugo Getting some feedback before writing the KIP makes sense.

The dilemma was between two choices with the existing background scheduler: 1) single-shot scheduling via `.schedule()` of a `task` to delete a single directory (topic-partition) and 2) periodic scheduled task to delete queued logs. Single-shot scheduling, although simpler, is dangerous because a boatload of deleted topic-partitions may hog the entire background thread-pool for just deletions, starving other periodic tasks including, log-retention, log-flusher, and recovery-point-checkpoint. \r\n\r\nAn alternative thread-pool of background threads could be used but it requires a separate user-facing config and was therefore eliminated.\r\n\r\nA periodically scheduled deletion task (option 2 above) has two sub-options: a) scan the directory looking for any directories marked for deletion (\"*.delete\"). b) Use an internal queue of logs that contain directory names. Option 2.a is not attractive because most of the time the directory scan will not result anything to delete. Besides it's IO heavy. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the only reasonable option is to use 2.b where in an explicit `LinkedBlockingQueue` of logs is used in producer/consumer style. \r\n\r\nThe current patch keeps track of IO failures during one run of deletion and retries the failed directories at the next scheduled run. `LinkedBlockingQueue` has O(1) `take` and `put`. This scheme is perhaps simpler than an explicitly synchronized access to a regular list. Alternatively, `removeFirstOccurance` could be used in O(1) time (in absence of failures) because always the head of the list will be `remove`d, terminating the search quickly.

They can parallelize things but don't require the user to think about how to do it. Also, a number of issues with the current approach: why is 50 minutes the magic number? What if Travis is OK with it and I want faster turnaround time on my builds? Do we have to move all the files around again just to get that? (That actually messes with any regression tracking since the test name changes...) Why couldn't the number of workers be parameterized and independent of the test directories? What about when we add the parallel test runner and test runners that get tests utilizing a smaller # of workers per test might be able to execute their share faster? What about tests that are parameterized a lot and therefore generate a larger number of tests than can possibly complete in 50 minutes (i.e. your granularity is a single test file, so if that exceeds your limit we have to jump through hoops to break it up, even if it's a single test; things like upgrade tests could easily grow to this size over time).\r\n\r\nI think everyone agrees with the benefit of having this run more cheaply via docker and in Travis. The point we were trying to make is that this seems to be tackling half of that problem at the wrong level, and a real fix in ducktape doesn't seem particularly hard to implement afaict -- we just need to be able to tell the test runner to run 1/N of the tests. For tests with significant skew in their run times this isn't perfects, but I think extreme skew isn't currently a problem based on one of the recent runs of the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun time:   1

assuming tests are approximately equal would have to take every 1/Nth test rather than take blocks of 1/N tests.\r\n\r\nSee [this ducktape PR](https://github.com/confluentinc/ducktape/pull/154) as an example of what I'm suggesting, which would remove all the changes required within the tests themselves and just require adding the `--subset=X --subsets=10` parameters when invoking ducktape, isolating any choices about how Travis runs the tests to the Travis-specific files (although we'd still be hard coding the choice of 10 test runners/Travis env matrix parameters into those files).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/263045897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/263095310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2174#issuecomment-263095310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2174","id":263095310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzA5NTMxMA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-27T00:56:06Z","updated_at":"2016-11-27T00:56:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma
