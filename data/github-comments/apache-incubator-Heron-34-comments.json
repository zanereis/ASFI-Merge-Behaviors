And the submitting command will be:\n\n```\nheron submit yarn ~/.heron/examples/heron-examples.jar com.twitter.heron.examples.ExclamationTopology ExclamationTopology --extra-launch-classpath <extra-classpath-value>\n```\n\nAnd the key point is the `extra-classpath-value`.  It should be the `hadoop-lib-jar` path if you want to submit topology to YARN. If you are familiar with the hadoop working environment, you can put all jars in an  independent directory such as '$hadoop-lib-jars' , and the submitting command will be:\n\n```\nheron submit yarn ~/.heron/examples/heron-examples.jar com.twitter.heron.examples.ExclamationTopology ExclamationTopology --extra-launch-classpath $hadoop-lib-jars \n```\n\nAnd there is an easier way to use `--extra-launch-classpath` arg by following steps.\n-  Finding your hadoop classpath by following command.\n\n```\n> hadoop classpath\n```\n- Making sure every single path is existed\n\nThen the example submitting command in my working environment will be:\n\n```\nheron submit yarn ~/.heron/examples/heron-examples.jar com.twitter.heron.examples.ExclamationTopology ExclamationTopology \\\n--extra-launch-classpath /home/hdfs/heron-yarn-classpath-jars/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/etc/hadoop:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/common/lib/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/common/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/hdfs:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/hdfs/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/yarn/lib/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/yarn/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/*:${HADOOP_DIR_HOME}/share/hadoop/mapreduce/*\n```\n\n**About second question**\nPlease notice the command I gave above. I downloaded the jars I need and put them to the `/home/hdfs/heron-yarn-classpath-jars/` directory and invoked them first. \n\n```\n> ll /home/hdfs/heron-yarn-classpath-jars/*\n-rw-r--r-- 1 hdfs hdfs  52988 Jun  14 2015 /home/hdfs/heron-yarn-classpath-jars/commons-cli-1.3.1.jar\n-rw-r--r-- 1 hdfs hdfs  71909 Sep  13 14:06 /home/hdfs/heron-yarn-classpath-jars/curator-client-2.9.0.jar\n-rw-r--r-- 1 hdfs hdfs 192090 Sep  12 16:57 /home/hdfs/heron-yarn-classpath-jars/curator-framework-2.9.1.jar\n```\n\nAbove all, I think it should work!  Let me know if you have any other question.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/247948877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/247973574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1399#issuecomment-247973574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1399","id":247973574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Nzk3MzU3NA==","user":{"login":"yunfan123","id":5563799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjM3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5563799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfan123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfan123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T11:55:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T11:55:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can I run all of heron components in docker?

Please re-submit with these changes:\n\n#### 7. Debugging Java topologies\n\nThe jar containing the code for building the topology, along with the spout and bolt \ncode, is deployed in the containers. A Heron Instance is started in each container, with each\nHeron Instance responsible for running a bolt or a spout. One way to debug Java code is to write debug logs to the log files for tracking and debugging purposes.\n\nLogging is the preferred mode for debugging as it makes it easer to find issues in both the short and long term in the topology. If you want to perform step-by-step debugging of a JVM\nprocess, however, this can be achieved by enabling remote debugging for the Heron Instance.\n\nFollow these steps to enable remote debugging:\n1. Add Java options to enable debugging on all the Heron Instances that will be started. This can be achieved by adding the options `\"agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8888,server=y,suspend=n\"`. Here's an example:\n   \n   ``` java\n   conf.setDebug(true);\n   conf.setMaxSpoutPending(10);\n   conf.put(Config.TOPOLOGY_WORKER_CHILDOPTS, \"-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError\");\n   conf.setComponentJvmOptions(\"word\",\n       \"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8888,server=y,suspend=n\");\n   conf.setComponentJvmOptions(\"exclaim1\",\n        \"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8888,server=y,suspend=n\");\n   ```\n2. Use the steps as given in the tutorial to [set up remote debugging in Eclipse](http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-remotejava_launch_config.htm).\n   \n   To set up remote debugging with IntelliJ, see the [remote debugging instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/run-debug-configuration-remote.html) .\n3. Once the topology is activated, start the debugger at `localhost:{PORT}` if in standalone local deployment or `{IP}/{HOSTNAME}:{PORT}` for multi-container remote deployment, and you will then be able to debug the code step by step.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/248733722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/248751090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1404#issuecomment-248751090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1404","id":248751090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODc1MTA5MA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-21T21:39:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T21:39:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @lucperkins -
