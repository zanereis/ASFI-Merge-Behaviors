\r\n\r\nMoreover, in TF [the other NMS op](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression) is  the standard, single class NMS, so for them combined or not is really single vs multiclass distinction. In contrast, our existing NMS also does multiclass NMS where a single box is associated with a single class. This variant of multiclass NMS has a different notion of \"multiclass\" and can support PyTorch and MXNet.

It doesn't work by simply changing some defined constants. Quite a number of codes have to be changed in order to make it consistent.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to open a new PR later to fix the chisel codes. It is ideal that the chisel implementation can kind-of auto-derive the hardware parameters from the vta C++ headers. This re-structure of the chisel code needs the help from @vegaluisjose, and is not very related to this PR. \r\n\r\nSo I think maybe we disable the tsim test and merge this PR first since the changes in the VTA repo already merged.

ONNX `NonMaxSuppression`, TF `combined_non_max_suppression`, and TensorRT `batchedNMSPlugin` (the implementation calls it `allClassNMS`) This is the variant of **multi** class NMS where a single box can be selected multiple times per different classes.  \r\n    https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#NonMaxSuppression\r\n    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/combined_non_max_suppression\r\n    https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/plugin/batchedNMSPlugin, https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/blob/master/plugin/common/kernels/allClassNMS.cu   \r\n\r\nSo the bottom line is, I think it is reasonable to say that NMS, without adjectives, should refer to the single class variant (category 2 above), but there isn't a consensus on what to call the third category one which this PR is about.\r\n\r\nI think `all_class_non_maximum_surpression` or `per_class_non_maximum_surpression` are the most descriptive of what it does. Either one is fine for me and I'm open to other suggestions @mbrookhart @jwfromm ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/814840398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/814855497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7805#issuecomment-814855497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7805","id":814855497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDg1NTQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T11:58:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T13:19:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is an expected behavior. See explaination of the buffer_map signature here https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/tir/function.h#L57\r\n\r\nSpecifically, in the low level code, note there is a difference between the two things:\r\n- T0: The DLTensor* pointer that points to the DLTensor* structure\r\n- T2: The actual data pointer in the DLTensor structure that points to a data field.\r\n\r\nThe tvmscript format illustrates this fact more clearly\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@tvm.script.tir\r\ndef fun(a: ty.handle, b: ty.handle):\r\n    Abuf = tir.match_buffer(a, (3,), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    Bbuf = tir.match_buffer(b, (3,), dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    A_buffer_var: ty.Pointer(\"float32\") = Abuf.data\r\n    B_buffer_var: ty.Pointer(\"float32\") = Bbuf.data\r\n    B_buffer_var[0] = A_buffer_var[0] + 1\r\n```\r\nSee also a C version that illustrate the type signature, notice Abuf, Bbuf do not exists in the final lowered code)\r\n```c++\r\nvoid func(DLTensor* a, DLTensor* b) {\r\n    float* A_buffer_var = (float*)a.data;\r\n    float* B_buffer_var = (float*)b.data;\r\n    B_buffer_var[0] = A_buffer_var[0] + 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the low level IR, the buffer vars corresponds to the data field(A_buffer_var and B_buffer_var). While the parameter arguments corresponds to the pointer to the DLTensor* field. Their relation are maintained via the match_buffer statements, and translates to the buffer_map field in the function signature.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is intended because it is important to distinguish the following three things in the IR:\r\n- T0: in-memory pointer to the DLTensor*\r\n- T1: abstract buffer(Abuf, Bbuf) that only exists during compile time, but will be staged to the individual elements\r\n- T2: The pointer to the data field (A_buffer_var and B_buffer_var)\r\n\r\nThe introduction of all three concepts are needed due to the following rationales:\r\n- T0 is needed because we need to faithfully represent the argument being passed to a function.\r\n- T1 is needed, and cannot be T0 because in certainly cases like GPU, we cannot afford to pass a DLTensor* pointer directly to the kernel, but need to construct a buffer in an abstracted way, which get stagged to the individual fields\r\n- T2 is needed because this is the data pointer that we directly operates on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/814855497/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/814856230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7805#issuecomment-814856230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7805","id":814856230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDg1NjIzMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T12:00:13Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T12:00:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Given this is more of a development question, we can also followup on the https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/814856230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/814860499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7765#issuecomment-814860499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7765","id":814860499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNDg2MDQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-07T12:06:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T12:06:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @junrushao1994 for keep improving the PR. \r\nThanks @jroesch @comaniac @jcf94 @Hzfengsy @MasterJH5574 for reviewing.

nice! Just did first pass through the code and overall it looks good.\r\n\r\nA couple of thoughts/questions:\r\n1. TF Combined NMS allows for both a) using same boxes for all classes and b) using different boxes for each class.\r\nFor a) the shape of boxes input is `(batch_size, 1, num_boxes, 4)`.\r\nFor b) the shape of boxes input is `(batch_size, num_classes, num_anchors, 4) `.\r\nCurrently, your implementation only supports a) and has a box input shape of (batch_size, num_anchors, 4).\r\nI think all of the uses of combinedNMS I have seen in TF have only used a), but perhaps in the future we may want to also add support for b).\r\n \r\n2. This is regarding the output format. One common thing after getting the selected indices is using those to gather the coordinates and scores of the selected boxes.\r\nSince the selected indices are in the format `[batch_id, class_id, index]` we can actually use them directly to index into the scores tensors which has shape `(batch, num_classes, num_boxes)` to get the selected scores.\r\nBut for the selected boxes, we need to slice out the batch_id and index and concat to get them into the format `[batch_id, index]` before we can index into `boxes` tensor to get selected boxes. \r\nIs my understanding here correct? I'm wondering if we can improve this somehow.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/816306316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/816332966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7810#issuecomment-816332966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7810","id":816332966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjMzMjk2Ng==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T01:11:04Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T01:11:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tkonolige some unit tests are failing, could you take a look?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/816332966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/816344862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7812#issuecomment-816344862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7812","id":816344862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjM0NDg2Mg==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T01:51:25Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T01:51:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The test passed the CI so it should be fine.

Yes, we should be able to support such variant easily. The only place we touch box coords is here (`i` is the batch or row index, j and k are the index of sorted scores) https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/6d314deb49898967361f62c194c9ea3685961dfd/python/tvm/topi/vision/nms_util.py#L132-L141 we can do arbitrary indirect indexing into boxes.

Yes, they are different. The `v2.5.0` is a tag and so a cut of `master` when the release happened. The `v2.5-branch` is a maintenance branch where the backports land (the great majority are fixes) for 2.5.0 and, afaik, it's considered stable at any time. I pointed out that this PR requires the `v2.5-branch` because the fixes I've listed (that are necessary for the MPS2-AN521) landed in `master` after the \"cut\" for the `v2.5.0` release, so I had to backport them to Zephyr 2.5.0, hence they are present in `v2.5-branch` only.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817013111/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817021381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7796#issuecomment-817021381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7796","id":817021381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzAyMTM4MQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T23:16:52Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T23:16:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mbrookhart

I agree that the use of delete is minor.\r\n\r\nIn the case of push constant, we can try to obtain these constant and put them into target. The main problem is the code as it is we are querying on the local machine but we need parameters on the remote. It would be useful to consider de-coupling to avoid such inconsistency(of information obtained by compiler and information in the runtime). e.g. The kernel should declare whether UBO or push constant is being used in its function meta-data, so we do not need to make dependency on the runtime parameters (e.g. the compiler decides whether to use UBO by arg size, and write that to an optional meta data of the shader to enable UBO). e.g. we can add a bitmask flag to VulkanShader::flag to indicate the difference\r\n\r\nThe runtime simply read that information and run dispatch, this will avoid inconsistency during compile time and runtime. We can then enhance the target registration to include such informations of max push constant per target, while defaults to the minimum value.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a closer look, there are a few more potential things that needs to be fixed:\r\n\r\n- Vulkan runtime have deferred mode and immediate mode that needs to be executed in separate ways(see the two places using push constants), we will need to do the same thing for UBO logic, right now seems that the code will work for immediate mode but not deferred mode\r\n- Right now the UBO argument buffer simply re-allocates without deleting the original buffer, this could cause memory leaks. We will need to have a logic that re-allocates if necessary(also think about relation to synchronization in deferred case) and use the buffer if the size is large enough.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817311853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817313701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7717#issuecomment-817313701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7717","id":817313701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzMxMzcwMQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-11T14:07:07Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T14:08:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I confirmed that it also works for deferred mode (by always returning false from `UseImmediate()`).

Meanwhile, for the example, it seems to me that the following design is more OOP style:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntvmc_model = tvmc.load(onnx_resnet50)\r\ntvmc_model.tune(target=\"llvm\")\r\ntvmc_package = tvmc_model.compile(target=\"llvm\")\r\nresult = tvmc_package.run(device=\"cpu\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can clearly see `tvmc_model` is the basic and the most instance in TVMC, and most features can be easily found out by looking at its methods. In addition, we can also learn from the method `compile` and `run` that `tvmc_package` is the compiled result of `tvmc_model`; `tvmc_result` is the execution result of `tvmc_package`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817976580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817978760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7813#issuecomment-817978760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7813","id":817978760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzk3ODc2MA==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-12T17:09:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T17:09:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @maheshambule @areusch Thanks a lot for the hint on how to check lint locally. I was not aware of them : ) `make format` actually suggested more than 200 changes, which really seemed too picky and not necessary, so I ended up using just `docker/bash.sh tlcpack/ci-lint:v0.62 ./tests/scripts/task_lint.s` and it made the magic.\r\n\r\nyeah so this is why you should prefer `docker/lint.sh` (or equivalent `docker/bash.sh`) for linting operations--the output of the lint tool is extremely sensitive to the version of e.g. `cpplint`, `pylint`, etc that you are using. the docker container removes that issue from consideration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817978760/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817982175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7775#issuecomment-817982175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7775","id":817982175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzk4MjE3NQ==","user":{"login":"altanh","id":3124994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjQ5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3124994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh","html_url":"https://github.com/altanh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/altanh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-12T17:13:52Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T17:13:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not super familiar with the interaction between parser and pretty printer, how come changing the printer solves the problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/817982175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
