Then the tenant associated with the user is only used to execute the task, so that the user and the tenant can be many-to-many, and the user can select the tenant and the yarn queue in the tenant to run the task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/698852848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/698863915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3416#issuecomment-698863915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3416","id":698863915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODg2MzkxNQ==","user":{"login":"BoYiZhang","id":39816903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODE2OTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39816903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang","html_url":"https://github.com/BoYiZhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BoYiZhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-25T10:54:23Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T10:54:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> associated\r\n\r\nIf Kerberos is enabled, the tenant is useless","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/698863915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/698868267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3822#issuecomment-698868267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3822","id":698868267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODg2ODI2Nw==","user":{"login":"zhuangchong","id":37063904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDYzOTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37063904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuangchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuangchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-25T11:05:38Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T11:05:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, where did you download this 1.3.1 tar?

PR的目的\r\n- 该PR为工作流添加标签功能。 完成了controller, sercive, mapper三层的代码，以便可以独立完成标签简单的CRUD。还有添加和删除工作流的标签，并根据标签查找工作流等功能。\r\n## 简要变更日志\r\n- 创建 `t_ds_process_definiton_tags` 表以存储标签信息，例如 `TagName` `project_id` `user_id`。\r\n   创建 `t_ds_relation_process_tag` 表以存储 `Tag` 和 `ProcessDefinition` 之间的关系。\r\n- 添加 `Tag`  `ProcessTag` 类，`Tag` 和 `ProcessTag` 的 `controller` `sercive` `mapper` `xml` 的代码。 为了实现标签的验证权限，将`project_id` `user_id`字段添加到`t_ds_process_definiton_tags`表中，以模仿`ProcessDefinition`中的相似验证功能代码。\r\n- `addProcessDefinitionTags`  `deleteProcessDefinitionTags`  `queryProcessDefinitionByTagId` 在`ProcessDefinitionService`中添加了三个新方法，以实现工作流添加，删除标签以及基于标签查询工作流。\r\n## 验证这次PR\r\n增加了测试，可以验证如下：\r\n- 添加 `TagControllerTest` `TagServiceTest` `TagMapperTest`.\r\n- 添加 `ProcessTagMapperTest`.\r\n- 添加 在`controller` `sercive`层的 `testAddProcessDefinitionTags` `testDeleteProcessDefinitionTags` `testQueryProcessDefinitionByTagId.`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/699800936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/699803241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3835#issuecomment-699803241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3835","id":699803241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5OTgwMzI0MQ==","user":{"login":"xingchun-chen","id":55787491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzg3NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55787491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen","html_url":"https://github.com/xingchun-chen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingchun-chen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-28T06:30:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T06:30:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"who
