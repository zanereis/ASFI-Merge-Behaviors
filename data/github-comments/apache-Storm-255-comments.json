\n\nLet me summary regarding nested map/array support.\n- accessing nested element in nested map/array works without modifying Calcite.\n  - it should be defined as ANY. Specifying MAP's value type to MAP doesn't seem to work. I don't understand this behavior but it works anyway.\n- We need to wrap value with CAST if we need to use value in expression. \n  - For example, `MAPFIELD['a'] = 2` doesn't work but `CAST(MAPFIELD['a'] AS INTEGER) = 2` works.\n  - Using value in projection (fields of SELECT) doesn't need to be wrapped with CAST.\n- NOTE: this is NOT a safe operation, and errors are shown in runtime.\n  - If value is null in any chance, comparing it to other will **throw RuntimeException** in runtime.\n    - Value itself could be null.\n    - Value could be null when we access array with wrong index or map with non-exist key. \n  - Wrapping it with COALEASE doesn't help, so it might be a bug on Calcite.\n  - If we access array with index out of bound, it will **throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException** in runtime.\n\nSo there's a way to support current feature with adding some inconveniences (CAST), but it is no longer safe operation. Since user can't handle errors manually, this can make worker continuously crashed.\n\nI asked Calcite dev. group about this and didn't get answer yet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249731569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/249732128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1714#issuecomment-249732128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1714","id":249732128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTczMjEyOA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T00:02:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T00:02:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arunmahadevan Other than that I addressed your review comments.

(Pain is amplified when tiny commit should be merged to all branches.) If I want to clean up commits before merging it should be more painful. CHANGELOG is subject to not in sync among branches, but we need to write it manually because it's hard to filter merge commits to see the change list. (We could just rely on JIRA issues for alternative.)\n\nRegarding commits, I don't want to keep commits like 'kicking travis', 'address review comments', etc. which is not helpful at any chances. For my last 2 years of development of Storm, I didn't  utilize individual commit. If something is wrong with recent merge, we rollback the merge, not individual commit. Squashing commits is widely used strategy and already shows success story to many big projects. Even Github provides the squash merge mode (recently rebase mode too) in GUI.\n\nIf we want to merge in squashed commit, it should be done in merging process, not reviewing process. For me, ideal review process should be contributor-friendly. While we can't put efforts to only maintain Storm project (by reviewing pull requests, etc.), contributors also can't. Once we create a script which also squashes the commits, we don't need to make contributors bothering with rebasing and squashing commits. If not, all individuals including us should do it just after merger said 'please rebase and squash in order to merge.', which is also bothering for mergers, too. Moreover, there's a chance for contributors to be busy at the moment, and pull request goes stale. Pull requests which need upmerging are the case.\n\nI understand and agree the authorship issue, but we can treat it as exceptional case. Many pull requests are authored by one.\n\nLet's make merging phase as painless, or at least less painful thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/251537805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/251538461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1468#issuecomment-251538461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1468","id":251538461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTUzODQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"ptgoetz","id":260896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz","html_url":"https://github.com/ptgoetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptgoetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-04T23:02:12Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T23:02:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll also point out that the \"if other Apache projects do it, it is oaky\" stance is particularly dangerous.

I guess RC will be available in this week or so. \nI'll watch Calcite community and do some change (Calcite version) and let you know again. \n(I didn't think about this but I need to modify this PR slightly because of Calcite version. ;) )\n\nRegarding documenting available features, actually I didn't test all of SQL reference on Calcite. :) We can add test cases to see what features Storm SQL is able to provide, and adopt SQL reference page with some modifications. I'll file a follow up JIRA.\n\nRegarding examples, yes, we don't have any useful documents or examples so it should be next work of Storm SQL.
