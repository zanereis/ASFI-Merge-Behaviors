Aggregator modules, especially in the extensions-contrib module, can make some changes which may or may not be compatible with each other. I am actually not even sure if we have any such guidelines around backward and forward compatibility when it comes to extension modules.

There are two areas I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n- For APIs, we have `PublicApi` and `ExtensionPoint` annotations. For those APIs annotated with one of them, there could be incompatible changes in those APIs between major releases. For non-annotated APIs, they can change in breaking ways in any releases. \r\n- For segment read, we should be able to read any format of segments no matter how old Druid created them (I didn't know this policy when I raised https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9246). This applies to segment format, all shardSpecs, and all loadSpecs. \r\n\r\nThese policies apply to across all Druid modules including contrib extensions. \r\n\r\nBased on these policies, if the aggregator type has changed inadvertently, that's a compatibility bug and should be fixed by supporting both old and new types.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think your PR might be still useful since people sometimes might want to run Druid without some extensions (for example, they just want to stop using those extensions). Even in that case, as you mentioned, it would be nice that Druid could be still functioning. Your PR could address this use case. I'll review it soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/610548834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/610562031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8992#issuecomment-610562031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8992","id":610562031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDU2MjAzMQ==","user":{"login":"averma111","id":43510964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTEwOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43510964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111","html_url":"https://github.com/averma111","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/averma111/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-07T18:55:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T18:55:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sure, we will rebuild again and follow the instructions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/610562031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/610564783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9622#issuecomment-610564783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9622","id":610564783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMDU2NDc4Mw==","user":{"login":"abhishekrb19","id":8687261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODcyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8687261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekrb19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekrb19/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-07T19:01:40Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T19:01:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintropolis, thanks for the pointer!
