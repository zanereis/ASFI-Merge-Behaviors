What if we want to extract conv2d_NCHWc instead of conv2d from graph?\r\n2. Is it possible to use one DispatchContext for tuning and another DispatchContext for compiling? For tuning we can use normal DispatchContext to generate a schedule from a workload. For compiling we need to generate a schedule from a node index. \r\n3. measure_batch is an internal function. To create layout tuner, do I need to create a standalone function to mimic the behavior of measure_batch?\r\n4. I'm not quite sure how to apply cfg template to conv2d_NCHWc, since the input data shape is 5-D and then the ic_bn in cfg needs to be the same as ic block length of input data. Currently autotvm task can benchmark a cfg given a fixed input shape, but here we want to benchmark a cfg given a workload and the actual input shape depends on each schedule in cfg.
