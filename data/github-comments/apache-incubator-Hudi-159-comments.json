If we are to write all database backups into Hudi table in their historical order, then do the live database snapshot and only then start consuming new changes, then all the events will be written into Hudi table in their proper chronological order, although useless as all the dates will be off - events will appear by the time they were written into Hudi table and not the time of the event itself.\r\n2.  If we are to partition Hudi table by the date of event, then we are able to query time ranges properly, but then we are simply getting all the events. To do a 'point in time' query we'd have to query all historical data and then combine duplicate events by their 'event time'. It is possible although slow and what is the reason for using Hudi at all as we can do the same with bare parquet.\r\n\r\nIf I am asking for a use case Hudi was not intended to handle, can someone maybe suggest the right tool for me, because I've been looking into temporal databases for quite some time already and still cannot find a solution capable to organize and query data in historical order and capable of storing large volumes of data (petabytes of it)?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/937267572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/937333824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3739#issuecomment-937333824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3739","id":937333824,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM433pRA","user":{"login":"bgt-cdedels","id":31484223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDg0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31484223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels","html_url":"https://github.com/bgt-cdedels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgt-cdedels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T00:00:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T00:00:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes,

I see that we have added lot of custom options w/ spark submit. when I have done benchmarking, 100Gb could get bulk_inserted in 1 to 2 mins for simple record keys and partition path. So, definitely something strange going on. \r\nCan we try to remove all custom options and try simple command. Does your executor have 48G memory? just confirming? \r\n\r\nI have tried to trim few configs. But lets try to keep some minimal so that once we get a good perf run, we can add back these configs and see which one is causing the spike in perf. \r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client --num-executors 100 --driver-memory 12G --executor-memory 48G \\ --conf spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=8192 \\ --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=\"-XX:+UseG1GC\" \\ --conf spark.shuffle.io.numConnectionsPerPeer=3 \\ --conf spark.shuffle.file.buffer=512k \\ --conf spark.memory.fraction=0.7 \\ --conf spark.memory.storageFraction=0.5 \\ --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem \\ --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.maximum=2000 \\ --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.fast.upload=true \\ --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.establish.timeout=500 \\ --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.timeout=5000 \\ --conf spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version=2 \\ --conf spark.hadoop.com.amazonaws.services.s3.enableV4=true \\ --conf spark.hadoop.com.amazonaws.services.s3.enforceV4=true \\ --conf spark.driver.cores=4 \\ --conf spark.executor.cores=3 \\ --conf spark.yarn.driver.memoryOverhead=8192 \\ --conf spark.yarn.max.executor.failures=100  \\ --conf spark.rdd.compress=true \\ --conf spark.yarn.maxAppAttempts=3 \\ --conf spark.network.timeout=800 \\ --conf spark.shuffle.service.enabled=true \\ --conf spark.task.maxFailures=4 \\ --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=2g \\ --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3.maxRetries=2 \\ --conf spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max=1024m \\ --conf spark.kryo.registrationRequired=false \\ --conf spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer \\ --conf spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=1536 \\ --class <class-name> \\ --jars /usr/lib/hudi/hudi-spark-bundle.jar,/usr/lib/spark/external/lib/spark-avro.jar \\ <jar-file-name>.jar\r\n```\r\nFor eg: when I did bulk_insert benchmarking, I used the below w/ spark-shell\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --packages org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.12:3.0.1 --conf 'spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer' --conf 'spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max=1024m' --driver-memory 8g --executor-memory 9g   --master yarn --deploy-mode client  --num-executors 15 --executor-cores 8  --conf spark.rdd.compress=true       --conf spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=true     --conf spark.executor.userClassPathFirst=true        --conf spark.ui.proxyBase=\"\"    --conf \"spark.memory.storageFraction=0.8\"  --conf \"spark.driver.extraClassPath=-XX:NewSize=1g -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70\"     --conf \"spark.executor.extraClassPath=-XX:NewSize=1g -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70\" --conf 'spark.executor.memoryOverhead=2000m'\r\n```\r\nNothing fancy, just set the appropriate memory, cores and some GC tuning configs and things worked for me. \r\n\r\n- bulk_insert configs.\r\nlets increase the index parallelism to 1000. let remove the storage level configs. I mean, lets try to get some baseline and then iteratively we can add back more configs. I see you are setting parquet max file size in your upsert command. probably we need to set them here too. \r\n\r\n- upsert configs.\r\nagain lets set index parallelism to 1000 and remove storage level configs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/937477763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/937770320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3647#issuecomment-937770320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3647","id":937770320,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM435T1Q","user":{"login":"novakov-alexey-zz","id":11204284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjA0Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11204284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/novakov-alexey-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T13:02:03Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T13:02:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think it is no longer blocked-on-user.

If its going to be on-going, I would recommend using a tool called [Deltastreamer](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/writing_data#deltastreamer) that hudi gives you. You can connect a source to Deltastreamer (parquet dfs in this case) and you can add a transformer(with which you can do filtering, transform, populate keys etc). Deltastreamer will take care of fetching data from source and ingesting to hudi at regular cadence(schedule at regular cadence for one time sync) or on continuous mode. We know many users in the community use this and has been very effective. Just incase you were not aware of it. \r\n\r\nMay I know whats the size and # of records with each batch of write to hudi? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/939305990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/939306022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3774#issuecomment-939306022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3774","id":939306022,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43_Kwm","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-09T14:27:34Z","updated_at":"2021-10-09T14:27:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot run azure","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/939306022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/939306069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3691#issuecomment-939306069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3691","id":939306069,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43_KxV","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-09T14:27:50Z","updated_at":"2021-10-09T14:27:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/939306069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/939352973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3770#issuecomment-939352973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3770","id":939352973,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43_WON","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-09T19:49:27Z","updated_at":"2021-10-09T19:51:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"can you disable metadata and get your unblocked?

Although - full disclosure - I work on XTDB and can say that XT's current architecture is not designed to handle PBs of data efficiently/cheaply without significant userspace sharding. However, we have a new storage & query architecture in the works that could get us a lot closer to that PB level...but perhaps still not at the same scale that Hudi already operates.\r\n\r\nFrom my very brief look at Hudi's design, I would be surprised if there isn't some possible combination to index your own valid time construct using derived tables and query with that efficiently (if inelegantly) via Spark / Presto etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/940232664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/940247146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3776#issuecomment-940247146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3776","id":940247146,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44Cwhq","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-11T18:00:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T18:00:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar
