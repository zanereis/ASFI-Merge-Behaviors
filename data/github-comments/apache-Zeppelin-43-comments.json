So whoever wants\nto create his own build ?\n\nSo instead of that approach I would suggest if this check/constraint can be\nmoved at run time level instead of compile time. So whoever tries to run\nthe interpreter gets the error and he/she then goes and install R. I\nbelieve both SparkR and RStudio work in similar fashion.\n\nRegards,\nSourav\n\nOn Wed, Feb 24, 2016 at 5:21 AM, Alexander notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Guys, please correct me if I'm wrong but current R interpreter\n> implementation, in order to be compiled, requires R installed on user's\n> machine AND it is included in the default build (at least right now) - that\n> would result in build failing for every user of Zeppelin out there after\n> pulling the change.\n> \n> I think what we may do, without breaking Zeppelin build for all the users,\n> is simply exclude R interpreter build from default build cycle of mvn\n> package and put it under profile, i.e -P r as we do with scalding,\n> pyspark and other interpreters \\w external dependencies .

That is on the list of \"to-do's,\" and is planned for after the initial merge. \n\nSecond, every time I've seen that error, it was because Zeppelin was configured to try to launch spark from Zeppelin home rather than from a SPARK_HOME.  It looks to me that that's what was happening here when you try to run it from the distribution directory.  (Is SPARK_HOME set?)  _But_ the R interpreter should be detecting whether there's a misconfiguration and, if so, failing gracefully.  The reason it isn't may be because of the pom/distribution issue.  Can you email me the spark interpretergroup log of that run? \n\nBefore anyone asks -- requiring SPARK_HOME is a feature, not a bug. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/189116032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/189117683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-189117683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":189117683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTExNzY4Mw==","user":{"login":"jeffsteinmetz","id":5488059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODgwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5488059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffsteinmetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffsteinmetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T05:14:32Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T05:14:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ah, I see.
