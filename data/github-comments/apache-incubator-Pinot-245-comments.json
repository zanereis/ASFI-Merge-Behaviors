For example, consider applying a simple equality filter with inverted index:\r\n>\r\n> 1.

If the segment has 100k unique UUIDs, the UUIDs themselves would span 3.6MB. At Uber we have a high readahead and page size, and the entire dictionary would be loaded into memory in a single I/O stall, leading to a largely CPU intensive binary search on the dictionary.\r\n\r\nThere are use-cases though where madv_random would be helpful (e.g. we have had issues with high ingestion throughput partial upsert tables at Uber (refer: [talk](https://youtu.be/z4Chhref1BM?si=GPekPgkVMlyrI7us&t=1462))).\r\n\r\nBut we can't change the default without a wide spectrum of consequences and I'd discourage that.

In terms of reducing plugin size, just dump some thoughts here:\r\n1. Separate the main pinot distribution with a few selective plugins;\r\n2. Package plugins into separated jars/artifacts for picking up;\r\n3. Provide scripts for downloading plugins before or at runtime;\r\n4. Docker image could stay as it is right now;\r\n5. Above changes should add no overhead(be transparent experience) from pinot users. And it might be small overhead for pinot devs, e.g. plugin development etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2261597559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2262362318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13726#issuecomment-2262362318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13726","id":2262362318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6G2OjO","user":{"login":"hpvd","id":5681880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODE4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5681880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd","html_url":"https://github.com/hpvd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hpvd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-01T08:32:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T08:36:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"double +1\r\njust some general thoughts on security:\r\n1. the bigger a package the higher the chance for security issues insights -now or some weeks after release.\r\nso\r\n- smaller package is always better\r\n- there may be more motivation to fix CVEs, when there is a chance to cut the number easily e.g. by half with fixing only 2 of them\r\n- we may think in future of decoupling release processes of plugins/artifacts to easily have a new release which fixes some things instead of having to wait for a complete one\r\n2. we should think of security when providing the possibility/scripts for downloading plugins before or especially at runtime\r\n- it may be a good idea to look at / use already available tools/processes for

just had a discussion with @mcvsubbu about this. Here's what we think:\r\nWith the proposed solution in this PR, there will be two IS flags indicating if the table is paused: \"isTablePaused\" and \"isQuotaExceeded\". That doesn't sound right. Instead we can have a more detailed field called pauseStatus. Here's an example for the storage quota exceed case:\r\n```json\r\n\"pauseStatus\": {\r\n  \"isPaused\": true,\r\n  \"reasonCode\": \"STORAGE_QUOTA_EXCEEDED\",\r\n  \"comment\": \"Current storage 2.3G exceeds quota 2.0G\",\r\n  \"time\": \"2024-08-01T09:30:00Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd here is an example for a regular pause that's caused by an admin hitting the pause endpoint:\r\n```json\r\n\"pauseStatus\": {\r\n  \"isPaused\": true,\r\n  \"reasonCode\": \"ADMINISTRATIVE\",\r\n  \"comment\": \"Need to change the underlying topic\",\r\n  \"time\": \"2024-08-01T09:30:00Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis way in case in future there's another reason for pausing the table, there's no need to add yet another field to IS to pause the table. We can simply do that by adding another `reasonCode` which is an enum in the source code.\r\nMoreover, in case in future we want to extend pause functionality like adding support for partition level pausing, we can simply add more fields to pauseStatus.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2266179376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2266228527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/12757#issuecomment-2266228527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/12757","id":2266228527,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6HE-cv","user":{"login":"sullis","id":30938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis","html_url":"https://github.com/sullis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sullis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-02T22:44:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T22:44:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Obsolete.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2266228527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2266794029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/13378#issuecomment-2266794029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13378","id":2266794029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6HHIgt","user":{"login":"Conaire","id":8114926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTQ5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8114926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire","html_url":"https://github.com/Conaire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conaire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-03T15:20:12Z","updated_at":"2024-08-03T15:20:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Pinot

consuming segment is consumed because the next consuming segment is already tracked on a different server. I don't see a better way to handle this corner case. The assumption is that `CONSUMING -> ONLINE` state transition will arrive very soon, and the consuming segment will either be sealed or dropped.

On a separate note, @mcvsubbu thinks it's better to have all the logic for hanlding storage quota (pausing/resuming) in one place, in \"realtime segment validation manager\" periodic job. Of course the benefit is that all the logic is in one place, so it's better in terms of maintainability. The downside of doing that is the the storage won't be checked till the next round of the periodic job. Maybe that's ok because normally consuming segments take hours to complete, and even checking quota upon segment completion is also delayed. WDYT?\r\n\r\nThere is enough going on during the segment completion, that I would hate to add more logic there with more conditions. Can you state why you need the quota to be checked during segment completion?\r\n\r\nI am even fine adding logic in the background task to remove latest segments (and adjust consumption offsets, of course) if the quota is exceeded (it may matter in some cases that the excess quota will result in charges). On the other hand, if this is the case, the metric on current storage use should be monitored in order to flag such situations early and in advance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2274055552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2274108292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13584#issuecomment-2274108292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13584","id":2274108292,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6HjCOE","user":{"login":"shounakmk219","id":25409127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDA5MTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25409127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219","html_url":"https://github.com/shounakmk219","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shounakmk219/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-07T18:40:28Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T18:41:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hey @mcvsubbu @sajjad-moradi , it is ok if the table storage spills over the quota by few segments before stopping the consumption and that said we can keep the quota validation + IS update logic at one place in segment validation manager. \r\nAlso as per the suggestion of introducing `pauseStatus`, a single check  on `pauseStatus` will cover both the pause reasons, eliminating the need of adding any extra checks during segment completion.\r\n\r\n> Can you state why you need the quota to be checked during segment completion?\r\n\r\nThere is no strict storage quota imposition requirement, but also didn’t saw any concern in putting the check during segment completion\r\n\r\n> remove latest segments (and adjust consumption offsets, of course) if the quota is exceeded\r\n\r\nWe don’t want to do this as this will affect the query results (moving back in time).\r\n\r\nIf it turns out that segment validation manager job frequency is not working for the storage quota imposition we can introduce a separate job when needed.\r\nLet me know if this sounds good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2274108292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/2274260643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/13723#issuecomment-2274260643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/13723","id":2274260643,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c6Hjnaj","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-07T20:07:50Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T20:07:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just noticed this PR.
