Additionally, this seems like a sane thing to do as now implementors of that interface get more data, which could be useful for different types of implementations\r\n- Made some small tweaks to the `RuntimeFactory` such that the returned `FunctionAuthProvider` and `RuntimeCustomzer` can be sub-classes of those classes that are specialized by implementing interfaces\r\n- Changed the
