There's no guarantee they are at 4096 offset, that's empiric - at least based on what I know as of now. The offset should be read from the file itself - that's why I've asked about dynamic offset.

It is a list of information for each glyph in a run. The useful information is the advance which based on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/xpsobjectmodel/ns-xpsobjectmodel-xps_glyph_index is measured in 1/100 em. Using this we can calculate the distance between runs and decide based on a threshold if a whitespace should be inserted. I have added some test xps files that I made to test this.\r\n\r\nThis implementation has some assumptions and limitations. Mainly that we do not get the glyph advance value for the last glyph in a run. I have used the average advance or 0.5 as a fallback in this case.\r\n\r\nIt also sorts the runs based on LTR unless all runs in a row are RTL. This maybe incorrect for cases where there is LTR and a multiple runs of RTL but I am not knowledgeable in this area.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/2434755713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/2434987172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/1970#issuecomment-2434987172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/1970","id":2434987172,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmW86RIvSk","user":{"login":"tballison","id":6739646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzk2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6739646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison","html_url":"https://github.com/tballison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-24T11:13:09Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T11:13:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wow.

This is just me, I like smaller pom.xml files that are easier to understand and maintain.\r\n\r\nThanks for the commits and notes. I'm not too familiar with the project and am entering through tika-pipes and its fetcher requirements, so I appreciate your patience.\r\n\r\n> Is it possible for you to create some sort of unit test, or is this impossible because one would need some google drive access?\r\n\r\nI imagine we could mock the response from Google Drive, so at least we test happy/sad paths.
