The factory can either throw an exception, or return an invalid value (`null`) and let the consumer throw. I think we're all in agreement that the behavior we choose should be consistent between `gcpTempLocation` and `stagingLocation`. I want to discuss pros/cons of either option:\r\n\r\n### Commonalities between both solutions\r\n* Consuming code must always do its own validation, because default value logic only gets called if a value isn't specified\r\n* Consuming code can throw an exception with enough detail for a user to understand where validation first failed.\r\n\r\n### Advantages of throwing exception from default value factory\r\n* Consuming code automatically gets validation of default values; less chance of using invalid value\r\n* Thrown exception can include exact details of what was invalid; consuming code doesn't need to infer what went wrong from invalid value\r\n* Consuming code doesn't need to have knowledge of default value chains in order to provide a useful exception message.\r\n\r\n### Advantages of returning an invalid value (`null`) from default value factory\r\n* Retrieving `PipelineOptions` is a safe operation, no need for try/catch block\r\n* Less redundant code as consumer should also do validation in case of invalid non-default value.\r\n\r\n\r\n@peihe, @lukecwik, is there anything I missed? Given the above tradeoffs, I think there's stronger advantages to having the default value factory throw rather than return `null`. I also think a longer term solution would be to add better validation support in `PipelineOptions` which can get applied to values, not just defaults.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/267108734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/267110079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1614#issuecomment-267110079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1614","id":267110079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzExMDA3OQ==","user":{"login":"amitsela","id":4245753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDU3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4245753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela","html_url":"https://github.com/amitsela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-14T18:13:48Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T18:13:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This
