Changing the configuration and maybe a restart is simpler and faster than jumping back to a previous version which may need to be redeployed, first.\r\n\r\nI know the related PR is almost complete. But maybe this is something to be considered for future changes that also break backward compatibility :).

This will leave the invoker in a queued/rescheduling state (since there will be a delay between reaching capacity, and the health action timeout), but once the Unresponsive state is reached, it won't be used again until it is Healthy again (has capacity to schedule containers)\r\n- This should be improved with such ideas like allowing invoker to declare itself Unavailable at will (as opposed to indirectly making this state change from timeout), and allowing controller to shard based on different data (activation memory affect at invoker, with respect to /init and /run invoker heap usage),

The change I made did not last. Have to figure out why.\r\n> \r\n> I opened an issue for apache infra team to look at: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-18003. I offered two ways to resolve this issue.\r\n> @neerajmangal @shichawl @rabbah @mrutkows\r\n\r\nI think you should have the pub file in /home/jenkins/.ssh, Infra team might be monitoring the directory /etc/ssh/ where you have placed the public keys. Also, I don't think you need three SSH keys to be generated on each machine as that will be difficult to maintain during deployment. \r\n\r\nAssuming you have permission to create a user on all of the VMs. \r\n\r\n- Create a user on all VMs and password -  owdeployer. For simplicity, you can have the same password for now, which can be disabled later to have only Key based access.  \r\n- Generate SSH keys - you can generate them anywhere. \r\n- Copy SSH Key to all VMs, this will automatically save the keys to /home/owdeployer/.ssh with proper permissions. \r\n\r\n```bash \r\nssh-copy-id -i <path-to-public-key> owdeployer@<target-machine>\r\n```  \r\n\r\n- Check if you able to access VMs with private key remotely. \r\n- You can store Private Key in the Jenkins Credential and Credential Binding plugin and use it in job to deploy openwhisk components on all distributed VMs with user as owdeployer in ansible.cfg. \r\n\r\n

Lambda has a nice feature of being able to create functions from an S3 file containing the source zip, which means you don't have to upload the same code for each different function. Not having something can make deployments unnecessarily long on OpenWhisk when you have a large app with dozens of functions and large action packages.\r\n\r\nIf this was available - I wonder if there's a way to define an \"action clone\" which is like a sym-link to another action with a different \"main\" parameter (defined at create time)? It would allow us to upload the action package once and then create sym-links for all the other actions. This would dramatically speed up deployments and reduce the amount of code needed to store in the backend.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/473243676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/473257614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4351#issuecomment-473257614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4351","id":473257614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzI1NzYxNA==","user":{"login":"SugandhaAgrawal","id":7805475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDU0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7805475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal","html_url":"https://github.com/SugandhaAgrawal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SugandhaAgrawal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T11:53:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T11:53:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chetanmeh - Can you please have a look?
