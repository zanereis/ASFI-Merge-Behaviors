The release of Airflow 2.0 is the possibility of introducing breaking and major changes, but this is not the reason why we should make these changes in a backwards compatible manner. Migration to Airflow 2.0 is a very big change and we cannot further hinder it by having to change every DAG.\r\n\r\nAdoption of AIP-21 took place under one statement \"All proposed solutions are backwards compatible.\".  It was also a topic of discussion in the community on the mailing list. If the changes are to be incompatible, it is worth avoiding them, but if we can have an apple and eat an apple, i.e. make changes and maintain backward compatibility, we should do it.

This change results from an attempt to unify and adapt operators to GCP guidelines (~190 changes in current spreadsheet). This will apply to almost all GCP operators. In the next steps, we will also think about unifying the names of other operators.  Such a change cannot take place in a way that prevents migration.

Why does the operator need to write the connection object to the DB?\r\n\r\nThis Hook retrieves authorization data for an external database based on the instance name in GCP, and then you create a database connection so that hook (PostgresSqlHook / MySqlHook) can read it. Hook does not accept authorization data passed in any other way than via connection. We wanted to avoid entering an ambiguous constructor who accepted authorization data. This could discourage users from using connections instead of creating hooks from the credentials data.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that for the database connection to work it is necessary to run SQL proxy, and in the connection configuration a unique random port number and the name of the local socket are saved\r\n\r\n> Yes, that probably seems fair (or make it read only if that's possible/sensible)\r\n\r\nIn this case, he needs an additional method in our backend.

If you're using K8S, it's very easy to share config map/env var with whichever node, no matter it's webserver, scheduler, or worker.\r\n\r\nIt seems the Kubernetes Executor should be responsible for passing configuration required for the Airflow worker/scheduler/webserver itself to function.

However, sometimes you need to keep state. For example, when you are poking a Dataproc operator, and waiting for it to get started, you want to keep the ID of the operator. I've suggested this to store this in xcom. Xcom is initially intended to share data between operators/senors, but in this case, I think it would be great to also use it to share state between operator/sensor instances. It is already in there, and you can also look at it through the GUI. If you clear the xcom fields upfront, then the state would have been wiped before the next instance of the operator/sensor would run.\r\n\r\nI've poked Bas and we've had a discussion about why this was in there, and what the implications are when doing an upsert of the xcom fields, instead of clearing them upfront. We could not come to an obvious reason. To give some history, it was initially added 4 yours ago: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/f238f1d614061573fca48817cbf5314c772d12d2. And then it was moved to later in the task process: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1951 \r\n\r\nPersonally I don't expect the user to notice a lot since it will only keep the xcom values a little longer.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1134248/67616669-cc5c2480-f7db-11e9-86d1-89dfcdca7a3a.png)\r\n\r\nSo there is no async part in there AFAIK, but the clearing of the xcom is delayed until it is upserted (atomic :-). Does this answer your question Bolke?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546582724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/546594592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6285#issuecomment-546594592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6285","id":546594592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjU5NDU5Mg==","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-26T11:31:20Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T11:31:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
