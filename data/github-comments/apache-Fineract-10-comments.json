Sidecars are typically used for things which have to run in the same \"Linux namespace\", so that they share files and IP address and hostname, which can be useful for things like \"envelopes\" like \"proxies\" which only accept connections from localhost, or some log file scraper, or whatever. A completely separately running database wouldn't be a typical use case for a sidecar, I think, so the way @xurror is proposing it seems fine (and more \"standard\"), to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/565169877/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/565172705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/651#issuecomment-565172705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/651","id":565172705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTE3MjcwNQ==","user":{"login":"mohitsinha","id":3825809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjU4MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3825809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha","html_url":"https://github.com/mohitsinha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohitsinha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T20:27:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T20:27:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes.
