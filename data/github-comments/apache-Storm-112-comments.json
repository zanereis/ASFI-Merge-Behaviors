This code has no issues with acking.  But there are a few real issues.\n\nFirst the latency on low throughput queues is much higher.  This is because it has to wait for the batch to time out.  That timeout is set to 1 ms by default, so it is not that bad, but we should be able to do some on the fly adjustments in a follow on JIRA to dynamically adjust the batch size for each queue to compensate.\n\nSecond the number of threads used is a lot more.  1 more per disruptor queue.  I expect to reduce the total number of disruptor queues once I have optimized other parts of the code.  As it stands right now I don't want to do that, because the two queues per bolt/spout design still improves performance in many cases.\n\nThird in the worst case situation it is possible to allocate many more objects than previously.  It is not actually that many more, we already allocate a lot of objects, which needs to be looked at on a separate JIRA at some point.\n\nAlso I don't want to shove this code in without doing a real comparison between the two approaches and the code.  This is one way of doing batching, but there are others that may have advantages over this, or may compliment this approach as well.  I just want storm to eventually be a lot closer to the 1 million sentences/second mark than it is now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/143872114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612478581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4254#issuecomment-2612478581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4254","id":2612478581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0Nzg1ODE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-28T21:00:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:00:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

Including the source task id to it would help us understand the task-task (component/component) network bandwidth characteristics. It shall also avoid the deserialization of message to retrieve the source task id from the serialized tuple message.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/bourneagain/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/bourneagain/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1071\" title=\"Task Message format to include source task id.\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1071\"><del>STORM-1071</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/768.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/768.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #768</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit cd1c0e56264676c496b115b96c8ee28c44d39eda<br/>\nAuthor: Shyam Rajendran <rshyam.psg@gmail.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-09-29T08:06:53Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1071\" title=\"Task Message format to include source task id.\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1071\"><del>STORM-1071</del></a> : Task Message format to include source task id.</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612605024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/144032486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/753#issuecomment-144032486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/753","id":144032486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDAzMjQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"wangli1426","id":5260276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjAyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5260276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426","html_url":"https://github.com/wangli1426","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangli1426/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-29T11:34:12Z","updated_at":"2015-09-29T11:34:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @HeartSaVioR,\n\nSorry to interrupt, but could please kindly review the code?

It is 2x in a number of use cases.  But we have a lot of slowness in the metrics processing code, which, at least in the case of word count, is dominating the performance, which is probably why you were not seeing a 6x performance improvement in your pull like you were seeing before.  I am going to be doing some follow on optimization work on that.  The big thing right now is that the System CPU utilization went from 15-30% depending on the OS, etc. to 2-6%.
