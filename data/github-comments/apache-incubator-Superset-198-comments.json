issue...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/466234191/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/466234690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6694#issuecomment-466234690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6694","id":466234690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjIzNDY5MA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T01:18:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T01:18:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If

Basically, want to run superset on AWS Lambda. \r\n\r\nI have tried different methods recommended and all of them resulted in some or other place break of functionality. Eventually what i did was the below to make it work: \r\n\r\n1) In config.py i have added another configuration variable and used this variable in locations where redirect or appbuilder.add_link has been used.\r\n2) In templates folder there are places where directly '/superset/' has been used. So, even if i did first step right, the templates are not rendering in right way. So, i have to go and change the template as well (As of now I have hard-coded this. I need to make it configurable) \r\n3) In front-end i have added a file called config.ts and I have used this config in locations wherever redirect was done in front-end. This has fixed up all my front-end links. \r\n4) Only thing remaining for me was fixing \"Upload CSV to Database\" Link.  When we click this link and enter the data, since Lambda doesn't allow any writes i tried to write to /tmp - but since we don't know whether the next request is going to be served by same lambda or not... so this is an issue as of now. The way I am planning to fix this is to write the files to s3 instead of local folder. I am still figuring out a way to do this. \r\n\r\nAfter above all are done, I have used AWS Aurora Serverless as my metadata database. This way I don't even need to pay for the database since Aurora is MySQL version. \r\n\r\nHope this helps. Once i fix up the remaining this, I need to check how to make this available to all. \r\n\r\n-- No more nginx or other links.

That looks wrong to me.

thanks for the context. I think there may be a few issues with the `DISPLAY_MAX_ROW`: \r\n\r\n1. It's not apparent to the user that the display is potentially showing only a preview (there's no verbiage in the UI to inform the user of this). This can be problematic if a user is searching/ordering the preview expecting to see a certain value and/or is mislead regarding the cardinality of a specific column. \r\n2. It's not apparent that the preview/export to CSV could return different row counts. \r\n3. How does a user override the display limit, i.e., say they want to see more than the configured `DISPLAY_MAX_ROW` and don't want to export the results to a CSV file.  \r\n\r\nI would be concerned that a third configuration setting would surface more confusion. I also feel that #4941 makes it quite explicit that a limit is being applied and I would speculate that the user would expect that number of records (if applicable) rendered.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/467278697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/467291083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2890#issuecomment-467291083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2890","id":467291083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzI5MTA4Mw==","user":{"login":"pinky884","id":7560857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjA4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7560857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884","html_url":"https://github.com/pinky884","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinky884/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-26T04:31:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T04:31:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yeah sure..

Cypress is a very large package and installing/uninstalling a 500mb+ compressed thing is really bad for CI and docker image bloat... \r\n\r\nFor context, and for people less familiar docker, each docker command in a Dockerfile adds an immutable layer to your docker file, and each layer is more or less a filesystem diff from the previous immutable layer. Even if I `RUN npm ci && npm uininstall cypress` I have the issue that cypress stays burried in npm's cache (somewhere under `~/.npm`). Running cache free is not really an option as I want this cache in my `Dockerfile.build` target. Note that even if I could clear the cache, `npm ci` does waste time / network downloading and unzipping 500mb which takes minutes in an underpowered container. My only other options would be to maintain a cherry or mutate the package.json with `awk` prior to running `npm ci`, which is pretty nasty.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons I vote to merge this PR, and live with cypress as something we install on-demand / need.\r\n\r\n![container](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/487433/53442934-4d4dec80-39bf-11e9-8ebc-8c00f10b46e6.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/467588453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/467594197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6912#issuecomment-467594197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6912","id":467594197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzU5NDE5Nw==","user":{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-26T20:10:46Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T20:11:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's

The initial deploy fails (likely due to the db migration timing out), somehow the tag and tagged_objects tables get created but not populated with any data and the alembic_version doesn't upgrade to the latest because of the timeout. So if we try to deploy again it fails because it tries to rerun this migration but the Tag table already exists.\r\n\r\nI was assuming that the tables should get added along with the data all on commit at the end, is that not true?
