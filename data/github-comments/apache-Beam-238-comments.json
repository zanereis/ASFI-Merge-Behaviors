This is an alternative we considered for `DoFn` in which has `ParDo.of(doFn)` would implicitly get wired up to have side inputs accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe did not choose it because we want to move towards a design where side inputs are a parameter of the `DoFn`, not baked in to its closure: The `DoFn` declares that it requires side inputs, and the construction of the graph with `ParDo.withSideInputs(...)` satisfies those requirements.\r\n\r\nThis makes the `DoFn` reusable in more contexts. We could always abuse a `DoFn` and do this anyhow, but this thoroughly violates the identity of a `PCollectionView` captured in the closure of the serialized `DoFn`.\r\n\r\nNow take those three paragraphs and substitute `WriteFiles` and `FileBasedSink` and `.withOverriddenSideInputs`. So the situation is the same. With `DoFn` we are trapped by legacy but here we should start with the right

don't think there is such an effort yet. I think I agree that it should be separate from TextIO because reading whole files could also mean reading binary files; and because the API for that requires some design (e.g. I'm not sure if we want to return a whole file as a String, as a byte array, or provide a user callback for parsing an InputStream into a stream of values of their desired type, like in MongoDbGridFSIO https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/mongodb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/mongodb/MongoDbGridFSIO.java#L144). It's definitely outside the scope of this PR and if you would like to make this contribution, it would be very welcome but I would recommend to first discuss the proposed API on dev@beam.apache.org.\r\n\r\n\"Task 2 can be done with Task 3 + ParDo\" - this I'm not sure, because of the above - we might be reading very large files whose content doesn't fit into memory. I think it could be reasonable to implement Task 2 as a feature of TextIO and that would be within the scope of this PR. \"Reading multiline blocks of text delimited by a given line\" seems like a reasonable extension of \"reading lines of text\" and compatible with other properties of TextIO. We could also extend TextIO.Write to emit output in this format too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/317549870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/317550673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3598#issuecomment-317550673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3598","id":317550673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzU1MDY3Mw==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-24T20:51:22Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T20:51:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/317550673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/317572212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3549#issuecomment-317572212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3549","id":317572212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzU3MjIxMg==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-24T22:23:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T22:23:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually solving this stuff is pretty complicated.
