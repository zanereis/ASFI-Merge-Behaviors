New interfaces  describe\r\n* Directory  is a container of files . We create files here,open IndexInput for a file to read data we have written,open a IndexOutput for a file to write data into.\r\n* IndexInput  (sorry for @leventov   I have not got a good name ,maybe FileInput or something good ? Ôºåfor now to interpret my solution first,just have this name ,if find a good name ,I will refactor the code later) behaves like the ByteBuffer. We use seek() to move file point, use length() to get the capacity ,use slice() to get a scliced one what needs to be noticed is that the sliced one's  file point will keep on growing compared to its original one,use duplicate() to have a fresh duplicated one\r\n* IndexOutput  a way to write data into a file of the Directory\r\n* RandomAccessInput:  As ` Indexed<T> `needs to random access a file ,this class supply a way to absolue read data from a file. The related methods need to be thread safe. subclasses may override this IndexInput.randomAccess() method for performance reason like what ByteBufferIndexInput class does.\r\n* bytecode format rule : the interface level to restrict data type like int/long/short to use big-endian byte code order. As Druid LongsLong encoding does not restrict byte code order, The LongsLongEncodingWriter and LongsLongEncodingReader class's write long method was specific written using bytes for compatibility . BTW,as Druid's other type byte code order are all big-endian ,why not having a uniform byte code order.\r\n* conventional column smooth file size is Integer.MAX_VALUE. So the interface to convert long to int is considering correctly. I have also noticed the PR #3743 that seems split larger columns into separate smooth files which also observes the Integer.MAX_VALUE rule.\r\n# What have done\r\n* implement a mmap version Directory\r\n* v9 version implemention based on Directory, using a new  DirectoryBasedTmpIOPeon not the TmpFilePeon to wite temp files like .header,.format,.drd and so on while creating directory,bitmap,metrics,timestamp index data.

Part of the patch here involves expressions becoming _only_ virtual columns, not being available at the ColumnSelectorFactory, Aggregator, Filter, etc levels. So that would suggest that instead of doing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"filter\" : {\r\n  \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n  \"expression\": \"index > 100 && index < 200\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would instead do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"virtualColumns\" : [{\r\n  \"type\" : \"expression\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"expr\",\r\n  \"expression\" : \"index > 100 && index < 200\"\r\n}],\r\n\"filter\" : {\r\n  \"type\" : \"selector\",\r\n  \"dimension\" : \"expr\",\r\n  \"value\" : \"true\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd something similar for aggregators. Rather than knowing about expressions themselves, they would refer to an expression virtual column. This would extend to any other concepts we gain over time, not just math expressions. The idea is moving towards using virtual columns as a sort of \"projection\" layer before we apply filters, groupings, and aggregations.\r\n\r\nThe JSON is a bit more complex, but the code inside is simpler (no need for aggregators, filters, and storage adapters to know about math expressions or any other sort of transformations) and more composable. I think that's a good tradeoff since it's common for Druid users to use query generators like plywood or SQL anyway, rather than writing the queries themselves, so it shouldn't be too much of a burden.\r\n\r\nMaybe you oversold me on the virtual column concept since now I want to use it for more things :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/265488351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/265488853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3758#issuecomment-265488853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3758","id":265488853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTQ4ODg1Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T16:06:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T16:06:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also,

Trying to build consensus on community opinion was the purpose of starting the druid-development list discussion. I just raised that PR to try to show what I'm thinking in a concrete way. I respect that you've spent much more time on this area than I have and I want to find something that works for everyone.\r\n\r\nTo me the big question right now is for _expressions_, and it's whether they should be a concept that is only accessible through the virtual column subsystem, or should they be a concept that aggs, filters, storage adapters etc are also aware of.\r\n\r\nIn general the place I'm coming from is trying to make sure we develop the various subsystems in Druid such that they can work well together. In the past, we've had a lot of problems related to certain subsystems not working properly with others (for example, not all filters working with filtered aggregators, not all aggregators working on outer queries of nested groupBys, etc) and generally we have had made progress on those issues by simplifying interfaces and reducing the number and complexity of touch points. So I'm looking to do something similar here, and I think that running expressions through virtual columns will help simplify things and reduce bugs.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense and I hope we can reach consensus quickly on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-development/_Sd78s7yU5U.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/265777369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/265787463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3758#issuecomment-265787463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3758","id":265787463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTc4NzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-08T16:39:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T16:39:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis would you mind PRing \"virtual-column-as-dimension\" so we can see what direction you are proposing there?
