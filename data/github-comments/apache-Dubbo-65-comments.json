并没有我配置的信息。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/416617605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/416801119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/2395#issuecomment-416801119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2395","id":416801119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjgwMTExOQ==","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T02:19:04Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T02:19:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@carryxyh
