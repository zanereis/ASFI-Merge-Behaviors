For example, the \".placement-plugin\" name should be added to the PluginInfo when the XML element is `<placementPlugin>`.

The property value of `true` would cause the node config plugin source to be used instead of the ZK plugin source, and any plugins that were configured would not be loaded.\r\n\r\nMaybe this isn't a real problem, and its unlikely that anyone would configure Solr in this way. You mention the property is not documented, so that could benefit us. I'm not sure how confident we can be about how safe it really is though. I think for that reason I slightly prefer the implicit selection of the pluigin source based on the presence of `clusterSingleton` declarations in solr.xml, but I'm ok to use the `disable.configEdit` property if we think its safe.

The more I see it proliferate the more it just seems like a bit of classic Enterprise Java type naming that doesn't mean anything...    \r\n\r\nI do see in our codebase `ExpressionType.DATASTORE` is used in streaming expressions that refers to \"Solr/Lucene\" as a source of data. It is also used to refer to a JDBC DataStore as well in our codebase.   Both of those represent Data Stores in the traditional generic fashion.   And don't imply a search index or other Solr specific concept.  \r\n\r\nAs I write this, I come back to why can't we just stick with Collection?   Reading the ref guide glossary again, the definition of `Collection` is `In Solr, one or more [Documents](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/getting-started/solr-glossary.html#document) grouped together in a single logical index using a single configuration and Schema.`.       \r\n\r\nYes, it also says `Single-node installations and user-managed clusters use instead the concept of a [Core](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/getting-started/solr-glossary.html#core).`.

E.g. if we want `type:bug`, `type:feature` that could be separate from the component labels. But I'm too ok with both styles. It is also possible in GH to rename a tag at a later time, so we can add name-spacing later if we want to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1883196648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1883275132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1833#issuecomment-1883275132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1833","id":1883275132,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5wQH98","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T15:33:35Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T15:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd like to get this merged before tackling the next step of SOLR-16876....","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1883275132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1883364525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1999#issuecomment-1883364525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1999","id":1883364525,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5wQdyt","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T16:22:00Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T16:22:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cpoerschke when I demoed this code at the last community meetup, @gerlowskija asked why not to commit it, and I didn't have a super great reason.

See these [swagger-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-gradle-plugin#jakarta-namespace-support) docs for a bit more context.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1889968282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1889992866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2191#issuecomment-1889992866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2191","id":1889992866,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5wpwCi","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-12T21:48:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T21:48:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Main and 9x since the 9.5 release will use wizard from branch 9x","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1889992866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1890044549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2193#issuecomment-1890044549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2193","id":1890044549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5wp8qF","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-12T22:05:13Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T22:05:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> LGTM.

(@epugh - I agree that some doc changes would be helpful in clarifying that \"collection\" is sometimes used generically in the \"logical index\" or \"collection or core\" sense).  This'll work in 99% of cases.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are some edge cases where (IMO) we can't unambiguously use \"collection\".  Consider `QueryingApi.JsonQuery`, a generated SolrJ class for making queries using the v2 paths:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static class JsonQuery extends SolrRequest<JsonQueryResponse> {\r\n    ....\r\n    public JsonQuery(StoreType storeType, String storeName, Object requestBody) {\r\n      super(\r\n          SolrRequest.METHOD.valueOf(\"POST\"),\r\n          \"/{storeType}/{storeName}/select\"\r\n              .replace(\"{\" + \"storeType\" + \"}\", storeType.toString())\r\n              .replace(\"{\" + \"storeName\" + \"}\", storeName));\r\n    }          \r\n```\r\n\r\nOur v2 API uses different paths to distinguish between queries to individual cores (`/cores/<coreName>/select`) and to collections (`/collections/<collName>/select`).  In order for `QueryingApi.JsonQuery` to be re-usable for both these cases, its ctor takes an enum (currently called \"StoreType\") to indicate what is being queried so that it can build the correct HTTP path.\r\n\r\nAs an example: what would you all prefer as the name for this enum?  \"CollectionType\" wouldn't make any sense here IMO.  If we think \"store\" is more overloaded than \"index\", then I can rename it from `StoreType` to `IndexType`?\r\n\r\n(fyi @dsmiley )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1894171295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1894200828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2118#issuecomment-1894200828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2118","id":1894200828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5w5zX8","user":{"login":"gbellaton","id":66298424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mjk4NDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66298424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton","html_url":"https://github.com/gbellaton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gbellaton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-16T17:33:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T17:33:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should I add the New Feature in the 9.5.0 section of Changes.txt ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1894200828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1894204371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2118#issuecomment-1894204371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2118","id":1894204371,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5w50PT","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-16T17:35:33Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T17:35:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, 9.5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1894204371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1894206680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2177#issuecomment-1894206680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2177","id":1894206680,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5w50zY","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-16T17:37:00Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T17:37:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How much do you hate the idea of not having `storeType`??

Indexes can be sharded and replicated for performance and reliability, using either one of two [Solr Cluster Types](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/cluster-types.html). One type of cluster requires no supporting infrastructure, and instances are managed directly by administrators. The second type uses [Apache ZookeeperTM](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) to coordinate management activities across the cluster._.  It interestingly doesn't say *collection* or *core* ;-).

The `queryResultCache`'s `queryResultWindowSize` is forcing the actual number of documents to be raised from 0 to that window (which is 1 in this test config), thus we have to score docs to find the one best doc.  \r\n\r\nI don't agree with your solution because it confuses what `useFilterCache` fundamentally means (use the filter cache for `q`).  The other code path is actually already optimized for `rows==0` and no scores; it should be quite fast!  \r\n\r\nI think the solution is to not save the results into `queryResultCache` when rows==0; thus the window won't be applied either.  But I don't think SolrIndexSearcher should set this, I think it should be in QueryComponent by setting `NO_SET_QCACHE` so that some plugin/customization can easily make this decision for itself.  Additionally, QueryComponent is setting `GET_SCORES` if `fl` contains the score but I think this should be further guarded by `rows != 0`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1913487230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
