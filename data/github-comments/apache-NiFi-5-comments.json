I left an additional patch on the ticket with some stylistic items and version update (0.4.2-SNAPSHOT) changes I would like to apply on top of your patch.  \n\nMy final comments are concerning some of the properties.  In the case of the metric property, this is something that you use as a float to provide in the transmission to the Riemann server.  It would be good to include this in the property descriptor to make this a little clearer.  This should also be applied to the TTL and time properties.  I did some digging to try to figure out how to flesh this out more, but wasn't quite sure how to best describe them.  If you can provide some additional detail on those and the anticipated input, it would certainly help.  Apologies if this is a misunderstanding on my behalf, still quite the Riemann novice.\n\nAlso, the caught NumberFormatException would likely benefit from a log syntax more along the lines of:\n\n```\n        getLogger().warn(\"Unable to create Riemann event.\", e);\n```\n\nThis coincides with the above comments regarding the enhanced descriptions of the number driven values.\n\nThanks again for the updates though and with some additional details on the properties I think we are good to go!  Thanks for all your efforts!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/167489597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/167584009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/91#issuecomment-167584009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/91","id":167584009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzU4NDAwOQ==","user":{"login":"rickysaltzer","id":347356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzM1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer","html_url":"https://github.com/rickysaltzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickysaltzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-28T14:55:03Z","updated_at":"2015-12-28T14:55:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @apiri, I'll try and update a few of the descriptions to make things more clear and upload a new patch.

I think the expected approach (correct me if wrong) is there would simply be new classes created in the utility module and then the existing classes in standard procs would be marked deprecated and the existing processor impl would use the utility module import instead (thus making the now deprecated classes just sit there unused until they are removed in 1.0.0).

Flowfile in, elasticsearch out. **Extreme awesomeness**.\n\nFrom a user standpoint I guess this is what people expect to achieve when they request the ability to push and fetch data into/from ES. The functionality helps to reduce their learning curve, reduces duplication (and offloads the works to the development team...).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/173761891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/173769666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/180#issuecomment-173769666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/180","id":173769666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Mzc2OTY2Ng==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T01:22:22Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T01:22:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are right that more processing would be needed to coax the flow file into the right format for the *Http processors.

This PR represents a pretty significant step towards integration with another framework so we need to be thoughtful about the user experience.  So while this represents a very interesting and compelling integration it may take a bit of time to get right.\n\nNow the PR as-is there are a few quick items I've noticed.\n-  It still appears the license and notice information included is copy/paste from the Flume nar as originally identified.  Those are very important to to get right.  \n-  There does not appear to be any tests.  \n-  Documentation on the approach, idea, and processor is very limited.  There is a sentence about it on the JIRA but it would be really helpful to understand more about the idea and how it compliments NiFi and Camel.  Users and developers will definitely want to know this.\n- There is a declaration of ThreadLocal usage and then the use of it appears commented out.  This will need to be removed.\n- There is use of e.printStackStrack() and this needs to be using the provided processor Logger.\n- A camel application context is provided in src/resources but it appears it should be a test resource\n\nVery much appreciate the contribution and effort.  Just need your understanding that things this important take time and a lot of diligence.\n\nThanks\nJoe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/174512618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/174544425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/189#issuecomment-174544425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/189","id":174544425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDU0NDQyNQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T15:31:12Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T15:31:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it happened often here in the Travis CI environment.
