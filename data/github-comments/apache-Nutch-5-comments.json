In ArcRecordReader that's `FSDataInputStream in` which should be kept open until `ArcRecordReader.close()` is called, but not every time `next(...)` is executed (with and without an exception). Only if `ArcRecordReader.close()` is never called the input stream may leak as resource (usually the max. number of open files per process is limited).\r\n\r\nGZIPUtils.unzipBestEffort() is different because the underlying ByteArrayInputStream is hold by a local variable.\r\n\r\nGiven that ArcRecordReader is rarely used (for 1.x it can be used to convert content from ARC files into a Nutch segment, cf. ArcSegmentCreator), I wouldn't personally spent much time for investigation, although I'm curious which opinion is correct.
