That's one of the reasons I chose to make a container image.\r\n\r\nHi @luocooong ,\r\nas you can see at the project downloads page, phoenix is shipped in several version-combinations. \r\nFor the newest phoenix version > 5 its only build against hbase 2.x and hadoop 3.x\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/phoenix/blob/master/pom.xml#L78\r\n\r\nIn fact that hbase 2.3.7 is the current stable release and it recommends hadoop 2.10.0 or 3.1.2, and Drill is already on hadoop 3, i would go with that constellation.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/rel/2.3.7/pom.xml#L1349\r\n\r\nphoenix == 5.1.2\r\nPQS == 6.0.0\r\nhbase == 2.3.7\r\nhadoop >= 3.1.2\r\n\r\nHope these thoughts help","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/959753259/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/959759327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2355#issuecomment-959759327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2355","id":959759327,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45NMPf","user":{"login":"javier-nieto-nexplore","id":83208332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjA4MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83208332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore","html_url":"https://github.com/javier-nieto-nexplore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T17:28:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T17:28:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @cgivre fully agree NPE is not a great hint, it took me some time to find a trail\r\n\r\nwe can note down this as a known issue but for me that's not an 100% acceptable solution, how high should you go with the slice_target to cover your needs i.e.:1M,10M? \r\n\r\nalso I'm a bit concerned about possible the side effects as we don't know the root cause of the issue.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/959759327/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/959821275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2359#issuecomment-959821275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2359","id":959821275,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45NbXb","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-03T18:46:24Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T18:46:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool contribution.

I was on the fence about submitting this as well.  I was kind of doing a \"branch purge\" and wanted to contribute some experiments I had been poking at.  Let me first give you the backstory...  Several years ago, I worked on an analytics project which unfortunately, we had to scrap because the data we received was in PDF format.   While there are python libraries that can parse PDFs, (and probably others), many have C dependencies which we could not build in our environment.  This project weighed on me because had we been able to actually read the data, we could have solved a mission critical issue.   \r\n\r\nFast forward a few years, I got into Drill, learned how to write format plugins, and stumbled on the Tabula library which is built for the purpose of extracting and parsing tables from PDF files.   I wanted to see if Drill could read these and if so, how well it did at extracting the tables and getting usable data from them.   The actual result was that it worked surprisingly well.   The extractors here do a very good job of identifying tables and extracting them into a tabular structure.\r\n\r\nOK... see inline for the rest.\r\n\r\n> Cool contribution. I'm not entirely convinced this is something that Drill should handle. \r\n\r\nI wasn't so sure either.  However, we do already support file types which are not used for big data processing such as ESRI shape files, and a few other random formats.  If you are viewing Drill solely as a query engine for big data, then yes this makes no sense.  If you are viewing Drill as a Swiss Army knife for data, then it makes more sense.\r\n\r\n> There are too many variables for the very limited controls which Drill provides. It is likely that this will work for one or two limited use cases, but not the vast majority of PDF files. \r\n\r\nLet me clarify that this is only for PDF files which contain tables.  (Either images that look like tables or actual text tables).  By design this will not work with all PDF files.  \r\n\r\n> Using JSON plugin config files to specify the mapping is awkward. Probably each file will need its own config, which is not scalable.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you're getting at here with the JSON config.  Could you be mixing this up with another recent PR which did add some JSON config options to the HTTP/REST storage plugin?  In any event, this format reader only has two config variables.  One which merges all the tables in the document together (in the case of a table which spans multiple pages), and the other which specifies the index of the table to parse in the event of a document with multiple tables that are not related.\r\n\r\n> Drill's fundamental design is to run at scale. It is highly unlikely that someone will use PDF files to store GB of data. If they do, they have problems bigger than Drill can help them solve. \r\nIndeed!  \r\n\r\n> Thus, this kind of plugin works only at the small scale: one or two files in, say, an embedded Drillbit with JDBC or SQLine.\r\n> \r\n> A better choice would be to wrap this thing in a script: tinker with the PDF extraction, using whatever tools are available, to get the right mapping.

The issues that I ran into were that it was surprisingly difficult to get the libraries that can parse PDFs to run.  \r\n\r\n> \r\n> Such an approach enables all manner of ad-hoc, small scale data extraction.\r\n> \r\n> Or, maybe Drill should offer a \"desktop edition\" that is designed for small, ad-hoc projects based on local files, with some way to handle all the tinkering needed when reading PDF files, images, Word files, spreadsheets, Twitter feeds, Slack posts another formats popular with data scientists.

For smaller use cases but without all the overhead and complexity.   \r\n\r\nWith that said, I don't really see a harm of including this.  Clearly this is not Drill's primary use case, but it can be really valuable.  I was actually helping my wife the other day with some data for her work.   In that situation, a state government agency sent her data in PDF format which we had to enter into a website.  Using Drill we were able to query the file and transform it into something actually useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/960348867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/960472017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2359#issuecomment-960472017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2359","id":960472017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45P6PR","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-04T05:35:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T05:35:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cgivre @paul-rogers, my 2c.  I guess some partial precedents for a format plugin like this are ones like format-image and format-esri (as noted), though those do only go after the explicitly structured content.  It would not surprise me if there are quite often cases of unfortunate people needing to scrape data out of 10^0 - 10^5 PDFs.  The purist in me agrees with Paul's thought: a Groovy script over whatever Java lib is used here could be employed instead.  That would not be automatically be parallelised like a Drill query is so a user with many PDFs _might_ be pushed all the way through GNU parallel to Spark.  All that is followed by this recurring thought: if Drill is disciplined and focussed only on SQL against standard big data formats then it finds itself trying to compete in an uncomfortably crowded space.  Probably fatally crowded.\r\n\r\nI do also note that the \"big\" and \"small\" data worlds are not disjoint.  I have in practice joined big data in Parquet with small reference data in Excel (actually EtherCalc).  Even in the big data regime reference data remains small and is maintained by humans in human forrmats rather than pumped out by machines in machine formats.\r\n\r\nThis is getting long again.  Last thoughts.\r\n\r\n- I feel this really should be good at finding and parsing tables (work often, rather than work seldom) for inclusion.\r\n- We should consider a subproject to contain our long tail of \"non-standard\" data formats.  This would separate away plugins that should not be expected to run with speed or realiability of the core data formats and keep the core distributable size down as we add format after format.  We could then start to distribute tarballs for `drill-core` and `drill-extra`.\r\n- This looks like a plugin that will benefit from Drill's optional schema.  That means we might have some unique ability to compete here.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/960472017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/960574075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2363#issuecomment-960574075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2363","id":960574075,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45QTJ7","user":{"login":"vdiravka","id":11904420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA0NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11904420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka","html_url":"https://github.com/vdiravka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdiravka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-04T09:09:34Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T09:09:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please name PR with Jira ticket number and name - `DRILL-8033: uptake POI 5.1.0`.

I believe that Drill uses the native support for impersonation that is built into Hadoop when it impersonates to HDFS, Hive, HBase (and MapR-DB through whatever is built into that).

So, what is Drill today? Is it still primarily used for distributed queries at scale? Or, as a handy desktop tool for data scientists? Probably both. The problem is, a tool that tries to be both a desert topping and a floor wax (let's see how old the readers are with this one), ends up being good at neither.\r\n\r\nOne approach, if we had resources, would be to create a Drill Desktop that is optimized for that case and encourages all kinds of specialized data connectors. Create an easy way to define those connectors (YAML files created by specialized web apps?) Ensure Drill has good integration with Jupyter and the other usual suspects.\r\n\r\nAnother approach, if we had resources, is the oft-discussed idea of separating the less-common plugins from the Drill core. Work started on this: to create an extension mechanism that made this possible. (Today, most plugins need quite a bit of Drill internal code.)\r\n\r\nSo, no harm in adding the PDF reader, but I expect usage will be pretty limited just because, for the folks that need it, configuration will be too hard. Better would be a Python or Spark job that extracts the data into a CSV file, then query the CSV file with Drill. Each step could be debugged easily. I can't imagine anyone will want to debug their PDF extraction using Drill's overly generous Java stack traces...

The broader topic is super interesting.  If SQLite started adding the features needed to compete with Oracle Database 21c it would quickly fail at being SQLite.  If Linux tried to be an OS kernel for both TVs and supercomputers it would... continue to dominate both extremes!  There are some twists here!\r\n\r\nPigeonholing formats into small scale and large scales is also a tricky business.

They've come back as millions of pages of PDFs.  Someone just asked me if we can help them find all invoices containing a particular SKU, and pull out the price on that line.  The ERP system only has the last 10 years loaded into it and they want to go back further\".\r\n\r\n\"Chuck 'em in HDFS, we'll run a Drill query\"\r\n\r\n\"But PDF is a desktop publishing format, not a big data format!

When querying CSV, Parquet and the like, it is very clear where the data lies. When querying Excel, PDF, HTML, Word, \"the web\", it is less clear: there is some amount of data mining needed to say that it is THIS table and not THAT one, that the table spans three pages, etc.\r\n\r\nThe question is, how does the user specify this? If it were me, I would not want to be tinkering with a JSON storage plugin config, watching my query fail with a Drill stack trace, or wondering why I got no data. Instead, I'd want a tool better suited for the task. Once I had that, if I then wanted to run at scale, I'd want to say, \"Drill, just use X and consume the data.\"\r\n\r\nSo, the question here is: is the JSON storage plugin config an effective way for a data scientist to mine PDF, Excel, HTML and other messy sources? I don't have an answer, I'm just asking the question.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we had the ability to have true external plugins, then this could easily be an add-on project. Those who know PDF could go hog wild creating a good solution. But, we don't, so every specialized plugin has to be part of core Drill. Is that good? That's also a question for debate.

The expressiveness of Drill SQL ∪ Drill format config JSON falls well short of that of a general purpose scripting language and for reading fiddly unstructured data that shortfall might rapidly become uncomfortable.  The format config for this particular plugin looks quite succinct, like the plugin will either automagically get your data out, or it won't and then you need to pack up and go and open the interpreter of your favourite scripting language.  Making your resulting script scale to millions of pages, if it that's needed, is left to the student.  I quite like the Ray project for Python myself.\r\n\r\nThis thread has triggered some thoughts.  If we find ourselves starting to write long essays of JSON in format configs then we should probably be concerned.  If we find ourselves trying to embed a miniature data processing DSL into format config JSON then we need to stop moving immediately and pray to the ancestors that we might be shown a path that will return us from wilderness.  I want to revisit the draft fixed width format plugin with these ideas in mind.  Its config allows setting names and types for columns, but for other formats we must do this in SQL.  I think we should only ever do this in SQL.\r\n\r\nI think we can do something on the packaging front.  These format plugins live under contrib/ in the source tree and are compiled to their own jar files.  If we simply change the final tarball-building stage of our Maven build to give us something like the following on our download page, would we not be in reasonable shape? \r\n\r\nPackage|Size|Description\r\n--|--|--\r\ndrill-core|300MB|Drill with core storage layer libs only.

Sometimes the PDF reader does not read tables perfectly and you get a mix of found headers and not found headers, so that's one reason I took that approach.\r\n2.  I actually dislike the `columns` approach from the CSV readers because it increases the level of complexity of queries.

When querying CSV, Parquet and the like, it is very clear where the data lies. When querying Excel, PDF, HTML, Word, \"the web\", it is less clear: there is some amount of data mining needed to say that it is THIS table and not THAT one, that the table spans three pages, etc.\r\n> \r\n> The question is, how does the user specify this? If it were me, I would not want to be tinkering with a JSON storage plugin config, watching my query fail with a Drill stack trace, or wondering why I got no data. Instead, I'd want a tool better suited for the task. Once I had that, if I then wanted to run at scale, I'd want to say, \"Drill, just use X and consume the data.\"\r\n> \r\n> So, the question here is: is the JSON storage plugin config an effective way for a data scientist to mine PDF, Excel, HTML and other messy sources? I don't have an answer, I'm just asking the question.\r\n> \r\n> Again, if we had the ability to have true external plugins, then this could easily be an add-on project. Those who know PDF could go hog wild creating a good solution. But, we don't, so every specialized plugin has to be part of core Drill. Is that good? That's also a question for debate.\r\n\r\n@dzamo @paul-rogers , These are all interesting points.  I'd like to focus on the config variables for a moment.  The PDF reader has 2 config variables:  the `mergeAllTables` and the `tableNumber`.   While a user could theoretically set these globally, they really are intended to be set via the `table()` function at query time.   For some reference the Excel reader has similar configs which allow a user to select different sheets within an Excel file, or define regions in a file where their data lives etc. \r\n\r\nIMHO, this flexibility is actually very good for the user, because it allows an administrator to configure global default values that make sense but also allow a user to make query-time changes so they can access their data.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fixed-width plugin (https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2282) I actually have a different vision of how this can be used, and will post comments there.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/963117787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/963130138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2282#issuecomment-963130138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2282","id":963130138,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45aDMa","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-08T13:04:54Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T13:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @MFoss19 @estherbuchwalter following some [recent chat](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2359#issuecomment-962673076) with @paul-rogers and my last comment here, how about a reduced format config such as the following? The goal is to get to something terse and consistent with what we do for other text formats.\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n> \"fixedwidth\": {\r\n>   \"type\": \"fixedwidth\",\r\n>   \"extensions\": [\r\n>     \"fwf\"\r\n>   ],\r\n>   \"extractHeader\": true,\r\n>   \"trimStrings\": true,\r\n>   \"columnOffsets\": [1, 11, 21, 31],\r\n>   \"columnWidths\": [10, 10, 10, 10]\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Column names and types can already come from a provided schema or aliasing after calls to `CAST()`. Incidentally, the settings above can be overriden per query using a provided schema too.\r\n> \r\n> There's also a part of that wonders whether we could have justified adding our fixed width functionality to the existing delimited text format reader.\r\n\r\n@dzamo In this case, I'd respectfully disagree here.  In effect, the configuration is providing a schema to the user, similar to the way the logRegex reader works.  In this case, the user will get the best data possible if we can include datatypes and field names in the schema, so that they can just do a `SELECT *` and not have to worry about casting etc. \r\n\r\nLet's consider a real world use case: some fixed width log generated by a database.  Since the fields may be mashed together, there isn't a delimiter that you can use to divide the fields.   You *could* use however the logRegex reader to do this.  That point aside for the moment, the way I imagined someone using this was that different configs could be set up and linked to workspaces such that if a file was in the `mysql_logs` folder, it would use the mysql log config, and if it was in the `postgres` it would use another.  \r\n\r\nMy opinion here is that the goal should be to get the cleanest data to the user as possible without the user having to rely on CASTs and other complicating factors.

Maybe standardising on naming of `columns[n]` and `column_n` is a small saving on cognitive load for users here?\r\n\r\n@paul-rogers with apologies to this PR for saddling it with so much broader design chat, I wanted to share a last set of findings from talking with others with you and finally ask if we might go over a couple of questions with you, away from this PR.\r\n\r\n1. I've polled some Drill devs and going after the \"long tail\" of formats and storage systems is mostly of interest to them.  @vvysotskyi even has an intriguing idea of a marketplace for these plugins, I guess something like the Eclipse plugin marketplace.\r\n2. I have developed a conviction that to go after the \"long tail\" and not produce a sprawling mess that neither developers nor users want to touch, we need to try to get strict (to the extent possible) about consistency in how plugins behave and how they are configured.  Today we already are not all that consistent (e.g. see remarks on `columns[n]` vs `field_n` above, on column `name` and `type` in fixed width format).\r\n3. Those I've spoken with do also like the idea of splitting our distributed packages into \"core\" and \"kitchen sink\", or something like that, to put us in a better position to go after the \"long tail\".  It sounds like we're okay with our existing mono repo containing many plugins but end users should not have to download the kitchen sink to query e.g. just JSON or Parquet.  Drill startup times will probably be slow for the kitchen sink because the Java class loader will have a huge amount to scan.  And developer testing could get onerous if we cannot compile only a subset.\r\n4. By chance I saw that BigQuery, which for some reason I've designated in my mind of as kind of the Rolls Royce of Dremel-family engines even though I know little about it, can query Google Sheets.  So even they entertain some \"small data\" formats, although nothing like what we're imagining.  Just an anecdote.\r\n\r\nI would love to consult with you on 2 and 3 in a sort of \"Very well, if you _must_ do a distribution of Drill with this long tail of formats, storage systems and UDFs in it then at least equip yourselves with the following practices\" chat.  Perhaps in the upcoming community meetup, otherwise outside (if it's of any interest on your end of course).\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJames","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/964848311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/965083051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2355#issuecomment-965083051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2355","id":965083051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45hf-r","user":{"login":"javier-nieto-nexplore","id":83208332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjA4MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83208332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore","html_url":"https://github.com/javier-nieto-nexplore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javier-nieto-nexplore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T12:25:57Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T12:25:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @luocooong here's some log with several query runs vs. local mongo with dummy data, changing the slice_target parameter made it OK/KO and going through the MongoScanBatchCreator log or not, also the fragment id has some 1:0/0:0\r\n\r\nHope it helps\r\n\r\n[error_log.txt](https://github.com/apache/drill/files/7512629/error_log.txt)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/965083051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/966278842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2353#issuecomment-966278842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2353","id":966278842,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45mD66","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-11T12:53:54Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T12:54:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@CuteKittyhoho \r\nDid you see the review comments from Paul?

even having `log4j-api` might conflict with `log4j-over-slf4j`, so it shouldn't be added.\r\n`Strings.java` was introduced as a workaround, but the actual issue is that Hive has a direct dependency in the code on `log4j-api`, but it shouldn't. \r\n\r\nIf there are other libraries that also do that, we can update `Strings.java` with the required changes to resolve run-time errors and create tickets for those libraries to remove such code, so eventually, this workaround will be removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/968345007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/968347826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2374#issuecomment-968347826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2374","id":968347826,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc45t9Cy","user":{"login":"pjfanning","id":11783444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning","html_url":"https://github.com/pjfanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-14T19:15:21Z","updated_at":"2021-11-14T19:15:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvysotskyi
