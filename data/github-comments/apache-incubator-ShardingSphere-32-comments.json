My Order entity class is as follows:\r\n```\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = \"t_order\")\r\npublic class Orders implements Serializable {\r\n    public Orders() {\r\n    }\r\n    @Id\r\n    @Column(name = \"order_id\")\r\n//    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY, generator = \"UserIdentityGenerator\")\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private Long orderId;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne(targetEntity =User.class)\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"user_id\")\r\n    private User user;\r\n\r\n    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL,fetch = FetchType.EAGER)\r\n    private List<OrderItem> orderItems = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n    @Column\r\n    private Double total; // 总金额\r\n   // setter and getter method\r\n    ......\r\n```\r\nThe relevant code of my query order is as follows:\r\n```\r\n@GetMapping(\"/range\")\r\n    public Object getOrdersByTotalRange(){\r\n        List<Orders> list = em.createQuery(\"SELECT o FROM Orders o WHERE o.total BETWEEN 400.00 AND 2000.00\", Orders.class).getResultList();\r\n        logger.info(\"++++++++ {}++++++++\",list.size());\r\n        return list;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(\"/count\")\r\n    public Object getCountOfOrder(){\r\n        TypedQuery<Orders> query = em.createQuery(\"SELECT o FROM Orders o \", Orders.class);\r\n\r\n        List<Orders> resultList=query.getResultList();\r\n        return resultList.size();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe above two methods will report the above mentioned exceptions. \r\nThe association table t_order_order_items will only be generated in the default data source. For example, if my default data source is ds0, only the ds0.t_order_order_items relational table will be generated, but when I query the orders logical table, it will be routed to ds1.t_order_order_items.
