I'd think that we could just start a new part of the website to capture this (since they are likely only developer-related). If we feel like it is worthy of mentioning in the release notes (e.g. the numbers are not misleading or context-specific), then we can do so. Otherwise, the website can just serve as the record of \"results\". We could expand this out to include things like ContinuousIngest numbers too (which would be awesome -- don't have to build up a list of numbers from release notes..)\r\n\r\n> We should also discuss alternatives to JMH.

Perhaps center the instance name instead? Right now we have 0 branding of our product. We should do better here (Name, Accumulo logo, ASF logo, etc). Could easily put something into the footer.\r\n* When the Monitor is refreshing the graphs, the UI seems to be blocked with auto-refresh -- you can't click any of the drop-downs. This is very painful as, if you're not watching the ajax calls happening, sometimes your button clicks are just lost.\r\n* Auto-refresh also appears to make 13 ajax calls per refresh which is pretty excessive at a refresh of 5s. We have the logic broken up which is nice, but when we're refreshing all of these, we should minimize the number of ajax calls we're making (get all the data in one call)\r\n* On the tables view, why do \"default\" and \"accumulo\" get auto-added when I select \"all\"? This seems repetitive.\r\n* We pull a lot of js files and load them. IIRC, we should try to get down to one JS file for Accumulo (maybe there's a maven plugin we could use to keep the separation in source but concatenate them at build time so we only include one in the HTML).\r\n* OS load should be truncated to a few digits (tenth or hundreth place).\r\n* Is it possible to create some docs about the REST API and publish those with the monitor? We have this great API but no information about the calls and the data. The XML and JSON stuff is there for old users, but we should try to push the new people to the new REST calls.\r\n* Tool-tips are a little intrusive. If I want to sort on a new column, they pop up really fast and make me move my cursor to view the top elements. Maybe make them slower to appear or semi-transparent?\r\n* Not all table column headers have tool-tips. We should make a pass for clarity/simplicity.\r\n* ~~Accumulo instance ID is shown nowhere that I've found. Nor Accumulo version (info lost over the old monitor).~~ **Found it** in the \"info\" menu. My gut reaction is that we could put instanceid and version somewhere more prominently (it's a common thing I check when debugging user systems), but I think we could drop the date (we're not a clock, we're a database!)\r\n\r\nLooks OK on my phone too (chrome), as well as FF and Chrome on my mac -- woo.

He clarified that the overall goal was to try to avoid `RandomVolumeChooser` as much as possible, no matter what went wrong (typos, etc.) when a user mis-typed a per-table chooser class or the class path was not set up correctly to find the user's chooser class.\r\n\r\nCurrently (without this PR), Accumulo has hard-coded defaults on `RandomVolumeChooser` in several places. This can be problematic, because it can result in filling up volumes reserved for certain tables or the WALs. Further, it seems to select the `RandomVolumeChooser` mostly silently.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes things so that if the user has configured the `PerTableVolumeChooser`, then when that fails to load a particular table's chooser (`table.volume.chooser` from a `TableConfiguration`), it will not fall back to the `RandomVolumeChooser`, but instead fall back to the system-wide setting (`SystemConfiguration`) for `table.volume.chooser` (for example, appearing in `accumulo-site.xml`, outside of any per-table context). If the user did not specify a `table.volume.chooser`, then then the `PerTableVolumeChooser` would simply fail. This ensures that `RandomVolumeChooser` is never used accidentally when using the `PerTableVolumeChooser`. A consequence of the change in this PR is that the defaults have changed, but this will only affect users who were relying on `general.volume.chooser` being the default and overriding `table.volume.chooser` (or vice-versa).\r\n\r\nThe following is how I'm thinking it should probably work:\r\nUse the `RandomVolumeChooser` as the new default for `general.volume.chooser` and empty string (or null) for the default `table.volume.chooser`, as they are in this PR (see last sentence of previous paragraph). Document *VERY WELL* (especially in the release notes) that if the `PerTableVolumeChooser` is required by the user (e.g. they were relying on it being the default), then the user **must** set the `general.volume.chooser` to the `PerTableVolumeChooser` **AND** must either set a default value for `table.volume.chooser` in the system-wide configuration (system-wide ZK settings, or site file) **OR** ensure `table.volume.chooser` is set for *every* table (or namespace). If loading a per-table chooser or the general chooser fails at any point, we simply throw an exception, rather than trying to find a fall-back chooser to use.\r\n\r\nIf we simply fail, rather than trying to fall back to some system-wide working configuration, we can still run into problems loading the class defined at that level, and it's not clear that is what the user wishes to occur. So, we should just fail instead. This would simplify this PR a bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/296812700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/297075424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/253#issuecomment-297075424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/253","id":297075424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzA3NTQyNA==","user":{"login":"ivakegg","id":347158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg","html_url":"https://github.com/ivakegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T15:51:02Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T15:51:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I concur that failing if a configured class fails to load is better then falling back to something else.
