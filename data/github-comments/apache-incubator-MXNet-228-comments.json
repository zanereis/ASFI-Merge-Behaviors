BeforeFirst function is also used after the epoch ends to reset the iterator. Since the dataset size may be indivisible by the batch size (and it is in the example shown by @chenboheng), by default ImageRecordIter resets itself and takes images from the next epoch to fill the last batch (it is shown in the first output shown in this issue - 2 last images from the last batch are the same as 2 first images of the first batch). Then the \"reset\" of iterator does not actually reset it - if it was, it would read those 2 images twice. \r\nIn order to improve performance, ImageRecordIter prefetches a few batches of data. It turns out that this dataset is small enough that the iterator prefetches all of it in those 2 seconds when the main thread sleeps, and so it reaches the end of epoch internally. Calling reset in that situation calls BeforeFirst in the same way it would be called after epoch is done, so it does not actually reset the iterator, but prepares it for a new epoch, with dataset being offset by those 2 images that it used to fill the last batch of the \"previous epoch\". That is why the result is different.  \r\nSo basically the bug can only be observed if the dataset is small enough that it fits in internal prefetch queue, the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size and we give it enough time to internally process the entire dataset.\r\n\r\nI guess the possible solution would be to treat the BeforeFirst as the end of epoch and not hard reset only if the end of epoch was actually reached through calls to next. I will look into fixing this. \r\nStill, the \"reset\" name kind of suggests it will completely reset the iterator and that is not the case if you reach end of epoch. @piiswrong What do you think about it? Is it acceptable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327134873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/327137336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2666#issuecomment-327137336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2666","id":327137336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzEzNzMzNg==","user":{"login":"pbertoni89","id":3540399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDAzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3540399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89","html_url":"https://github.com/pbertoni89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbertoni89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-05T10:33:06Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T10:33:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Maybe
