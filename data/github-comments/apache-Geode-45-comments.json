It already says you have to implement an \"add\" method etc. It s reasonable if we want to support exceptions from some of these methods to say so on the interface and then the implementer has to make sure and throw that type of exception. That would let the implementor explicitly say \"I could not do an add for the following reason\" and we could treat that as a handled exception. Other exceptions (like say an NPE caused by their coding error) could then be highlighted as unexpected. But with this code we have to treat all of them as unexpected and they end up with a big call stack in the log which is not needed if it is just something like \"I did not have file system permissions\".\r\n\r\nI think I am trying to protect the system from any unhandled exceptions, even if it's NPE, since this is other people's code. this way, at least on our side, we logged it and know exactly what went wrong.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/591585657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/591708605","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4711#issuecomment-591708605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4711","id":591708605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTcwODYwNQ==","user":{"login":"jhuynh1","id":5750994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTA5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5750994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1","html_url":"https://github.com/jhuynh1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhuynh1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-27T00:08:27Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T00:08:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We'll want to keep an eye out for any weirdness or uptick in flakiness but from what I can tell, this change is good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/591708605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/592099731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4725#issuecomment-592099731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4725","id":592099731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjA5OTczMQ==","user":{"login":"bschuchardt","id":7441204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDEyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7441204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt","html_url":"https://github.com/bschuchardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschuchardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-27T18:10:17Z","updated_at":"2020-02-27T18:10:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm closing this PR without merging it.

The original JIRA says:\r\n\r\n> The connection is left hanging (CLOSE-WAIT state). The peers are then unable to establish proper P2P communication later. \r\n\r\nCan you clarify what \"unable to establish proper P2P communication later\" means? If this is the actual bug, it would be nice to write a test that demonstrates how peers later cannot establish communications.\r\n\r\nThe test included with PR doesn't seem to test this case. It starts a locator and 3 servers. It then uses a test utility to \"crash\" the 3 servers. It then checks a connection count statistic, but it stops there. \r\n\r\nIn addition, by crashing the 3 servers, the test is actually causing the locator to detect a network partition and shut itself down. So the test is actually testing a connection count on an object that is no longer really valid or in use.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, the connection *should* already get cleaned up when the peer crashes or closes the connection by a couple of mechanisms:\r\n* The *writer* thread may detect that the connection is closed and clean things up\r\n* The membership system will notice a departed member and trigger cleanup of all of the connections to that member.\r\n\r\nIf there is a bug where we have problems connecting later, maybe it might involve fixing a problem with one of the above mechanisms? By introducing a third way to clean up the connection it seems like we might be introducing more possibilities for race conditions in maintaining the connection state.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/594205067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/594207821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4766#issuecomment-594207821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4766","id":594207821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDIwNzgyMQ==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T22:38:26Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T22:38:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jmelchio

I was really hoping that the inclusion of `swagger` as compileOnly was a debug mistake, and not something required to remove the warning on our side.

If you look at the geode-core its implementation but optional. This is because we don't have this modularized and unless you are starting the REST interface you don't need Swagger.

If some member go out or come back after command is finished and before output is shown it will print just num of members on which rebalance command is executed. So user can see that he has different number of members in the system and in the output of command and have a conclusion that rebalance command is not executed on all currently members in the system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/597585908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/597720660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4794#issuecomment-597720660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4794","id":597720660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzcyMDY2MA==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T16:04:15Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T16:04:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jmelchio
