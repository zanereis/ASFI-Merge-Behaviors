rel=\"sriharsha\">Harsha</a></p>\n\n<p>Sorry I have been out a lot lately and I am now just catching up.</p>\n\n<p>There were a few things that went into this one pull request.</p>\n\n<p>1) <tt>nimbus.impersonation.authorizer</tt> was set to <tt>\"backtype.storm.security.auth.authorizer.ImpersonationAuthorizer\"</tt> by default. This was done so when security is enabled it is one less config that needs to be changed when enabling security to get it to work, and to fail closed (like you mentioned)<br/>\n2) <tt>populate-context!</tt> was added to make sure that the user we impersonate is always the one from the UI.<br/>\n3) In the servlet callback handler we null out the \"user\" to try and avoid these sort of leaks again in the future.</p>\n\n<p>First of all to clarify a few things.  Having impersonation locked down should not prevent someone from submitting a topology.  It prevents someone from submitting a topology as someone else (which is the entire point of this JIRA). They can still submit a topology as themselves, without impersonation.  If that does not work then we need to file a separate JIRA and fix that, because I should always be able to submit something as myself no ACL required.</p>\n\n<p>I am confused about what behavior is the opposite of what we want.</p>\n\n<p>From what I see if you want ambari and the UI to both work, you would set <tt>nimbus.impersonation.acl</tt> to something like</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">nimbus.impersonation.acl:\n     ambari-server-storm: <span class=\"code-comment\">// <span class=\"code-keyword\">super</span> user\n</span>       users: [*]\n       hosts: [*]\n    ui-storm: <span class=\"code-comment\">//<span class=\"code-keyword\">super</span> user\n</span>       users: [*]\n       hosts: [<span class=\"code-quote\">\"my.nimbus.host\"</span>]\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>I don't really see why this is hard to automate.  If you have a cleaner way to do it I am all in favor of it, but we cannot default to allowing anyone to impersonate anyone else by default.  It is too easy for someone to shoot themselves in the foot and be completely insecure when they think thy are OK.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612609326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612923565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5731#issuecomment-2612923565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5731","id":2612923565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MjM1NjU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T20:49:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:26:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=roshan_naik\">roshan_naik</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"revans2\">Robert Joseph Evans</a> Not sure what you mean by \"back on the write\" .. are u saying have background thread that simply polls ZK every so often ?  That might fix this issue.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is one basic issue with this BP mechanism in general. It can put too much load on ZK.

So lets say if I kinitted as another user \"topology-user1\" . Than this user needs to be added to the list. Basically we need all the topology users to be in the list here. Otherwise the realPrincipal() ( where the topology owner's principal will be) won't be found in the ACLs</p>\n\n<p>What I was asking exactly what you showed in the example above. Instead of listing the users in the ACL we should've proxy-user there and it should've list of users, hosts, groups who can impersonate that user.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't throw any issues in uploading the topology. Only issues is getting the information about topology using REST Apis. If you pass doAs even if we have the nimbus.impersonation.acl set and it passes through that authorizer it will get authorization exception through simpleACLAuthorizer because actual user(storm) is in ctx.realPrincipal and ctx.principal() contains ambari-server-storm and this user doesn't have permissions on the topology. Either we make this principal a super user than we might be getting into another issue where one user can see other users topology information if they both are in impersonation acl or we should modify the simpleACLAuthorizer to check the realPrincipal and if happens to be a owner of the topology.</p>\n\n<p>I've a patch ready I'll post one in another JIRA.

race condition and they got off some how.  So yes we should have a backup thread to poll ZK for backpressure in case we get off some how with the triggers.</p>\n\n<p>As for the load on ZooKeeper yes, that too is one of my concerns, and we at Yahoo have been holding off turning it on by default until it has stabilized a bit and until we have moved all of our clusters to pacemaker.  We expect to turn it on fairly soon.  How expensive is it though?  If you are running zookeeper in the default configuration it can be very expensive because you are constrained by a single disk's IOps, and if you have lots of throttling going on then those IOps can get eaten up fairly quickly.  If you have the flush turned off, then it is going to be constrained by the write log to the disk, or by the network whichever saturates first.  If it is the write log then you get about 80MB/sec of writes, this is just writing a small amount of metadata, so it should not have that big of an impact, but I have not really measured it.  If the network then reads will likely saturate first because of the listings, but again this is a relatively small amount of metadata, so it should have a relatively small impact.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to turn it off in defaults.yaml that is fine, just file a separate JIRA for that.  If you have a better solution that will reduce the load on ZK that would be great, again file another JIRA for that and we can discuss details there.  I am skeptical that we will get anywhere near as good of a throughput if we put in a delay of some sort, and I think we would start to run into issues with heaps filling up if we put in too much of a delay.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612923574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612609335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4934#issuecomment-2612609335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4934","id":2612609335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MDkzMzU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-08T22:05:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:04:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>realPrincipal is the actual user making the thrift call.
