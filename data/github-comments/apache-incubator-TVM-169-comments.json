, @zhiics : Thanks for reviewing the changes. I am sorry i did not add test case this time cause i thought the test case wont be a valid scenario to represent to a user.\r\n\r\nI found this problem while reviewing code for another issue.\r\nTo explain the background of it. Please consider below points.\r\n1:> Tuple as mostly adapted datatype does not allow any of the member to get modified once created(position and pointers), so provided that Empty Tuple is a constant.\r\n2:> But in TVM context, the Tuples allows its member to get modified, even after creation, so provided that Empty Tuple is a variable(Get modified afterwards).\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if i am wrong at any point.\r\n\r\nI just handled for the fold_constant, as it was part of my analysis currently.\r\n\r\nBut in my personal opinion, all Tuple Nodes should be Immutable.\r\nIf you think TVM should implement Tuple as Immutable, i will close this PR(there is no point of checking for Empty Tuple as it becomes constant, once created)\r\n\r\nPlease provide your valuable opinions.
