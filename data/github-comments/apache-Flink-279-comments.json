Now I understand that you don't think that it is strictly required to let a failed task process exactly the same `InputSplits` and that it is just a side effect of the current implementation.\r\n\r\nSo in the end you've implemented it this way, because the `InputSplitAssigner` does not support returning `InputSplits`. Maybe that is something we should change. We could, for example, add a new interface which needs to be implemented by an `InputSplitAssigner` to support fine grained recovery. Otherwise, such a failure will result into a global failover.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that by storing `InputSplits` in the `Executions` that we are mixing a bit of concerns. For example, assume that we have three tasks failing and we also lost a slot. Then we could only restart two of these tasks and need to distribute the slots of the third `Execution` among the newly started `Executions`. It would be much easier to simply return all slots to the `InputSplitAssigner` and let the newly started `Executions` pull from there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/434628107/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/434629432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6684#issuecomment-434629432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6684","id":434629432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDYyOTQzMg==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-31T10:04:36Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T10:04:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 for exploring a way to return `InputSplits` to the `InputSplitAssigner`.

Does HDFS permit to rename to an already existing file name (replacing that existing file)?\r\n\r\nI've double checked it. HDFS has no ability to move file with overwriting. But this Pull request resolves this issue. \r\n\r\n In case of failure after restarting the ‘truncate’ method check if the original file exists:\r\n-   If the original file exists - start the process from the beginning.\r\n-   If original file not exists but exists the file with '*.truncated' extension. The absence of original file tells us about that truncated file was written fully and deleted . The source crushed on the stage of renaming the truncated file. We can use file with '*.truncated' extension as a resultant file and finish the truncation process.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to clarify your idea regarding recoverable writer with \"Recover for resume\" property.\r\nAs far as I understand in this approach if Hadoop version greater than 2.7 we going to instantiate recoverable writer with native Hadoop truncate logic and method supportsResume() should return true. Otherwise, we instantiate recoverable writer which never use truncate method (only create new files) and the method supportsResume() should return false.\r\n\r\nIf you ok with this approach I can prepare another pull request. But in this case, I need to wait when the logic which check the supportsResume method will be implemented.\r\nMaybe I could help you with it ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/434730831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/434730871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6977#issuecomment-434730871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6977","id":434730871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDczMDg3MQ==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-31T15:26:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T15:26:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @igalshilman .

The result can be that `updateInputChannel` does not request the sub partition of newly registered partitions. Due to that it can happen that a job gets stuck because it never consumes the input from a producer.\r\n\r\nYou can easily reproduce the problem by adding a `Thread.sleep(10L)` before setting `requestedPartitionsFlag = true`.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how much improvement these kind of changes actually bring. I'm a bit concerned that changes to such a critical component like the network stack get merged into master just before feature freeze. If at all, something like this should be merged at the beginning of the release cycle to give it more exposure. Moreover, Travis never passed and actually failed with an IT case running in exactly this problem. And also IntelliJ warns about the fact that `requestedPartitionsFlag` is accessed both in synchronized and unsynchronized context which should be red flag in most cases. I think we should be more careful in the future!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435073195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435078802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6849#issuecomment-435078802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6849","id":435078802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTA3ODgwMg==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-01T15:30:20Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T15:30:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for being unresponsive @TisonKun.

think the PR fixes a valid problem which is the logging of a non-critical issue in a way that it seems to affect the proper functioning of Flink. This can be very confusing to our users and, thus, I think we should change it.\r\n\r\nEven after fixing the underlying problem of the reporters I think we should not report a Reporter failure as a warning since Flink can easily recover from that.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the `ConcurrentModificationException` in the e2e tests is that they occur in tests where no exceptions should be thrown. Thus, disabling the log verification and adding some other test assertions to ensure the correctness of the test seems not right to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435330790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435332294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6996#issuecomment-435332294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6996","id":435332294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTMzMjI5NA==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-02T10:13:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-02T10:13:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The functionality can be valid but I am not sure if the attached JIRA is solved by this PR.

In both cases transactional.ids that we want to recoverAndCommit have been already committed and reused.

for the PR @bowenli86. I haven't had a detailed look at the PR yet (will try to do in the next days). \r\n\r\nJust one side note. I don't think there we have consensus on porting all code of the `flink-table` module to Java. In fact, I'd really like to avoid a fragmented code base. Instead, I'm in favor of splitting the module into modules (for example `flink-table-runtime`, `flink-table-planning`, `flink-table-api`) that can be incrementally ported to Java. This should be fairly easy for `flink-table-runtime` and hopefully possible for `flink-table-planning`. `flink-table-api` will be very challenging (if not impossible). So, before porting more Scala code to Java, we should reach consensus about our plans. There should be a thread on the dev mailing list that started exactly this discussion.\r\n\r\nThanks, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435840758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435842909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7018#issuecomment-435842909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7018","id":435842909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTg0MjkwOQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T11:30:39Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T11:30:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @tzulitai.

I know that Calcite's \"Cannot optimize\" exceptions are hard to digest, but they are only thrown when the optimizer cannot generate a valid plan. \r\n\r\nAborting the optimization is especially tricky for specialized operators like window join that require very specific conditions. If these conditions are not met, the join can often be executed with a regular (fully materializing) join. I don't think we should speculate whether this is something that the user intended to do or not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435869177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435873769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6994#issuecomment-435873769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6994","id":435873769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTg3Mzc2OQ==","user":{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T13:30:27Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T13:30:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright,
