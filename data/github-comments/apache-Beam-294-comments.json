Getters are represented by a `List<FieldValueGetter>`. So the factory creates former from the latter.\n\nNormally you can do this by mapping java types of the getters to coders using `CoderRegistry` or even manual mapping. This is what this factory does.\n\nProblem with SQL is that it uses `java.sq.Types` to describe types of the record. It keeps this information in `BeamRecordSqlType` in addition to field names and coders. And it is referenced across a bunch of SQL classes. To map the `java.sql.Types` to coders we then need a custom mapping, which is done in a SQL-specific implementation of this interface.\n\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\nI see.

We can do it either by providing a `saffron.properties` file in the working dir, or overriding the system properties.
