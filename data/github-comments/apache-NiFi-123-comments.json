I believe they are intended to accomplish the same thing, but the existing Regex allows the user to change the behavior between Line-by-Line vs. Entire Text. Using the Line-by-Line mode is preferred if the Regex does not span multiple lines because it uses dramatically less heap. It also allows for back references, etc. Not sure if the new \"Replace All\" provides a capability that isn't currently supported, that I'm just missing?\r\n\r\nThe Replace First is a nice addition. We should ensure, though, any time that we create a `String` from `byte[]` that we pass in the character set in the constructor. It looks like it's used when serializing the `String` back to the `byte[]` but not when creating the `String` to begin with.\r\n\r\nFinally, rather than using `IOUtils.toByteArray()`, would recommend creating an `byte[]` and then using `StringUtils.fillBuffer`, as is done in the `RegexReplace` strategy. Because we already know the size of the FlowFile, this is far more efficient (because it doesn't have to keep filling a buffer, creating a new one, and copying bytes over) and can cut down the amount of heap used to store the buffered data by up to 50% (because the ByteArrayOutputStream doubles the buffer size every time it runs out of space, so if it's already 512 KB and we need one more byte it creates a 1 MB buffer just to use 512 KB + 1 byte, for example, whereas a direct allocation takes exactly the right number of bytes).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/547131105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/547273495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3829#issuecomment-547273495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3829","id":547273495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI3MzQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"manojmamidyala","id":19792921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzkyOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala","html_url":"https://github.com/manojmamidyala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojmamidyala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T06:16:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T06:16:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If

Happened to run across an interesting error (which I think is unrelated to PR and may be an knwon issue with Kafka api).  My test cluster was initially misconfigured where I had a replication factor of 3 set for the internal consumer offset topic (via offsets.topic.replication.factor) yet only had one broker configured.  The Kafka Sink appeared to send data, according to debug, however Consume Kafka Record and the command line consumer could not retrieve any messages.  Looking into the error log I saw the issue, however I was surprised that this didn't appear in NiFi logs upon sending of the record:\r\n\r\nThis error can be ignored if the cluster is starting up and not all brokers are up yet.\r\n2019-10-31 14:16:45,149 ERROR kafka.server.KafkaApis: [KafkaApi-72] Number of alive brokers '1' does not meet the required replication factor '3' for the offsets topic (configured via 'offsets.topic.replication.factor').
