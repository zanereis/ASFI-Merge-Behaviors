Since interpreter text `%sparql` is user facing, I would prefer to configure the implementation of `sparql` in interpreter setting instead of via interpreter text.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Do you want me to update the interpreter settings with this functionality or will this be changed once another implementation gets added?\r\n> \r\n> I mean to use interpreter setting to choose which implementation. e.g. Add interpreter setting `sparql.type`. IIUC, user don't care about the implementation of sparql ( I may be wrong ), only administrator care about that, so we should put ti in interpreter setting which is often maintained by administrator.\r\n\r\nI understood what you meant, I just wanted to know if this is needed right now or if we add this setting in the future when another implementation is needed.\r\nNonetheless I tried adding support for different implementations. I hope this works for you ☺️ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/549781174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/549822879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3480#issuecomment-549822879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3480","id":549822879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTgyMjg3OQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T13:29:46Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T13:29:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it is fine to add this setting until there's another implementation.
