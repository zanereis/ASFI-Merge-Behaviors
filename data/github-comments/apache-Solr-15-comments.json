It was written as a weekend project for Gradle 1.0 using the apis suggested by their co-founder and maintained with updates based on recommendations from the core team. At that time there wasn't any options, but maybe now you'll have other choices that you prefer over this minimalistic approach.\r\n\r\nYour concerns can be addressed by specifying a resolution strategy to reject unreleased versions and use a custom report to filter the results to dependencies within your `versions.prop` file. That is configuration to customize it to fit your build.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately plugins that try to manage dependencies can easily break the ecosystem by making overly restrictive assumptions about how Gradle works.

ran into this problem today -- I'm glad others are working on it.  Unless I've misattributed this issue, I think this problem is not related to a \"custom sort\" -- one only needs to have a re-ranking boost function that could reduce the score from what it was.  QueryComponent.mergeIds doesn't know how to deal with scores that don't descend when you're sorting by score (as is the default).\r\n\r\nThe solution above is one approach and I think it's basically fine.  It assumes that `rr.rows` docs across all shards are more relevant than all docs that follow, which I don't think is necessarily true, although it usually is when your data is balanced across the shards, as is typical.  Another solution is to have the ReRankQuery machinery apply a constant factor to the score of all docs that follow `rr.rows`, so that the scores continue to descend.  The factor could be computed based on how close the scores were between these documents on the fence prior to reranking, and then it could apply it proportionally to whatever the final score is of the last re-ranked document.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1055672942/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1055707386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/714#issuecomment-1055707386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/714","id":1055707386,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM4-7ND6","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T17:58:58Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T17:58:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Out of curiosity, do you think an error message by solr should be thrown?

Personally I think that's fine and it can be seen as a possible improvement for the future. (I don't think the graphana dashboard is necessarily impacted by this. We could certainly add the tag filter for these metrics, but I don't think its necessary for this PR)\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and push the fix and let you take a look @dsmiley. Otherwise I'm good with this. Feel free to revert and fix in another way if you
