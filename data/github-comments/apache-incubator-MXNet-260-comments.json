Headers:\r\n\r\nAny file that existed before the dmlc->apache move should have two headers. The old one and the standard ASF one. Any file that was created after the code move should have only the standard ASF header. Note that this is high level, there may be a file that has other types of src headers, like maybe a piece of BSD code was copied in etc. \r\n\r\n2. License files. All these should be fixed. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOn your questions:\r\n\r\n1: I don't think we should be changing those two files. The files are currently in dmlc and not in apache. They are a style-bug in dmlc, and we do have the question of whether we should be pulling this code into mxnet as source the way we do.\r\n\r\n2: I believe this means putting back \"* Copyright (c) 2015 by Contributors\" (or sometimes a different year), wherever that was deleted in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7379\r\n\r\n3: It does look confusing. It looks like it came in on this pull request pre-Apache days: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/891 . As it was a contribution to an Apache 2.0 licensed project, the contribution would be under Apache 2.0. It looks like it is a specific version of the DMLC \"Copyright Contributors\" that is listing the 3 contributors who worked on the pull request. I would treat it the same as you do other DMLC files that say Copyright, but in this case list the three people instead of 'Contributors'.

If we support modes like `'full'` (or `'valid'`, which is equivalent to `padding=0`) in the future, the API could look like:\r\n\r\n`padding: int, str, or list of int/strs, where str is one of 'same', 'full', etc.`\r\n\r\nand one might write:\r\n\r\n`nn.Conv3D(channels=300, kernel_size=(3, 5, 7), padding=('same', 0, 'full'))`\r\n\r\nHowever, there is **novelty** when `stride > 1`; the input size needs to be known, as padding no longer simplifies to `dilated_kernel_size // 2`. I just saw that Theano compromised here; it defines `'half'` as this quantity outright, and never implemented `'same'`: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/tensor/nnet/conv.html\r\n\r\n@szha I think this novelty makes it hard to do on the front-end, but I'd love to be corrected. A practical approach could be to ship, in order:\r\n1. A frontend version (`stride=1`, symmetrical), with API\r\n2. A backend version (arb. stride, symmetrical)\r\n3. An asymmetrical backend version\r\n\r\nThe first is a quick win people would use (e.g., porting models from other frameworks). We can implement the rest as demand permits. I'm seeing more how hard things like (3) are, as e.g., cuDNN's API doesn't support it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336685290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336687197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8241#issuecomment-336687197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8241","id":336687197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjY4NzE5Nw==","user":{"login":"ZiyueHuang","id":24650346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjUwMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24650346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyueHuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyueHuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-15T05:14:04Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T05:14:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is there anything remaining to address? @eric-haibin-lin @piiswrong ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336687197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/336689180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8275#issuecomment-336689180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8275","id":336689180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjY4OTE4MA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-15T06:12:12Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T06:12:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The problem is how you pass same and full to backend.
