inspector</p>\n\n<p>    At a high level this enables users to optionally view the tuples (and some metadata) generated at individual spouts and bolts in a topology. A few things like the list of fields to log etc needs to be finalized, however raising a PR to get the review started.</p>\n\n<p>    Users can enable the option globally or at spout/bolt level via the storm UI. A new api is added to nimbus to accept global or component level debug flag and pass on this info to the workers by updating `StormBase`. The workers receive the updates via already existing timer (that currently refreshes the component `active` status) and based on the flags, sends the tuples and additional metadata to an internal `EventLogger` bolt.</p>\n\n<p>    The `EventLogger` is wired as an internal system bolt and outgoing streams are added from all spouts and bolts to forward tuples to the event logger. The event logging can be controlled via config option `topology.eventlogger.executors` (similar to topology.acker.executors). The forwarded tuples are field grouped on `component-id` and thus tuples from same spout or bolt always ends up in the same EventLogger task (if there are multiple executors defined) and the same logic is used to display the UI link so that users can easily view the logs via the existing event logging feature. This may be enhanced in future to load the tuples to a database and/or index and provide search capabilities etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/arunmahadevan/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/arunmahadevan/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-954\" title=\"Topology Event Inspector\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-954\"><del>STORM-954</del></a>-PR</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/673.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/673.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #673</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit a924e9efb461cd86cee7ff59d867c8cf2118f1e0<br/>\nAuthor: Arun Mahadevan <aiyer@hortonworks.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-08-03T07:04:30Z</p>\n\n<p>    Event (tuple) logging and viewing support.</p>\n\n<p>    1.

\nMakes sense.\nLast thing I'd like to know is that current patch can work with Hive 1.x.y.\nIf it isn't, storm-hive is just for 0.14.0 since you showed storm-hive doesn't work with Hive 0.13.0.\nIt would be better to specify supporting Hive versions to README.\n\n@caofangkun \nIf it doesn't affect storm-hive, I also think it would be better to remove explicit dependency about calcite, since higher version of Hive could require higher version of calcite.\nBut as I stated earlier, I didn't use Hive so verification and confirmation from Committer Sponsors are
