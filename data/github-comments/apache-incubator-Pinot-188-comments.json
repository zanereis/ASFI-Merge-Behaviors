How does the usage of a vert.x client differ from the existing pinot client ? \r\n\r\nI found the [GSoC project description](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/av8RmOiu) which is quite brief.

It will definitely increase the delay before a new consuming segment starts consuming events, but might not be the whole 30 seconds because we only persist snapshot for one partition, and it doesn't involve the segment destroy time. I added a TODO to consider optimizing it by only persist the changed snapshot, but want to see how long it usually takes to persist all the snapshot as a baseline.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1599349616/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1599648101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10936#issuecomment-1599648101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10936","id":1599648101,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5fWLFl","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-20T22:18:03Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T22:18:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc

You have to options:\r\n1. Use Rosetta to run maven, as explained in [Pinot doc](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/getting-started/running-pinot-locally#m1-and-m2-mac-support). Remember that Rosetta must be enabled in your shell (see [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/428768/on-apple-m1-with-rosetta-how-to-open-entire-terminal-iterm-in-x86-64-architec) or [this](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/718722)). You can verify if it is the case by executing `mvn --version`, which prints the `arch` it is using. It should say `amd64`. When Rosetta is disabled, it prints `arch: \"aarch64\"`. You may also need to install a `amd64` JVM.\r\n2. Run maven with Java 17, which will not use LArray but the new buffer library that doesn't use JNI. Again, to know which version are you using, just do `mvn --version`, which also indicates the JVM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1602077781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1602138350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10959#issuecomment-1602138350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10959","id":1602138350,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5ffrDu","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-22T07:20:31Z","updated_at":"2023-06-23T01:31:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10959?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#10959](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10959?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (8231392) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/2b47dd68926dd39da05949fc204388797dfd14cb?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (2b47dd6) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `0.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master   #10959      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage    0.11%    0.11%   -0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files        2189     2189              \n  Lines      117928   117982      +54     \n  Branches    17834    17851      +17     \n==========================================\n  Hits          137      137              \n- Misses     117771   117825      +54     \n  Partials       20       20              \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1temurin11 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin17 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin20 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin11 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin17 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin20 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin11 | `0.00% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1temurin17 | `0.00% <0.00%> (?)` | |\n| unittests1temurin20 | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin11 | `0.11% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2temurin17 | `0.11% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2temurin20 | `0.11% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Even if the kafka topic is partitioned by the same user_id, there is not guarantee that all users will be part of same segment.\n\nI shared above a work in progress branch with more funnel count aggregation strategies, effectively equivalents to DISTINCTCOUNT, DISTINCTCOUNTBITMAP and DISTINCTCOUNTTHETASKETCH. These do not depend on partitioning.\n\nThe strategy equivalent to SEGMENTPARTITIONEDDISTINCTCOUNT we have here is just a first version. When the column is configured as partition column we only have the same users across time boundaries between segments, which when grouping over time (eg per hour) to see funnel trends, gives good enough approximations. In the future it should be possible to incorporate a partition level (or server level?) phase so that we aggregate differently between segments within the same partition and segments across partitions. I will need more time for that though, for now I am adding different strategies so we can use the right one for each use case, as it will also depend on the sessionization window desired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1605753936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1605755373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10867#issuecomment-1605755373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10867","id":1605755373,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5fteHt","user":{"login":"dario-liberman","id":130933669,"node_id":"U_kgDOB83jpQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130933669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dario-liberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dario-liberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-24T22:25:39Z","updated_at":"2023-06-24T22:25:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I also noticed that this argument is taking steps and correlate column arguments as another function but we did not add any transform functions.

The tag is stored in Zookeeper and the Pinot controller is usually the right service to got the tag info. I wonder why we can not get these info from the controller?\r\n\r\nFor some of our observability requirements we need to retrieve tenant tags at instance level (for both brokers and servers).

It also adds a criss-cross dependency: observability for a given process relies on hitting another component (controller). It also increases controller HTTP load quite a bit as the number of instances increase.\r\n2. **Use ZK or Helix**: Using ZK directly is not clean since we would have to leak Pinot internal details about where the instance configs are stored to our sidecar. Using Helix directly is probably the closest to what we would be doing with this HTTP API approach as well, but I think the HTTP API approach is cleaner: the observability layer shouldn't need to know about Helix or other details, and this API can also be used generally in true sidecars in the future by not just us but even other users outside Uber.\r\n\r\nGiven the above I think it's best to have a separate API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1605850109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
