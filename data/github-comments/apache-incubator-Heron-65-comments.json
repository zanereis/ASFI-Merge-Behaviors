That means that any service discovery target that works with Prometheus will work with Kapacitor. Combined with a TICK script, you can use Kapacitor to monitor Prometheus scrape targets, write data into InfluxDB, and perform filtering, transformation and other tasks. With Kapacitor’s user defined functions (UDFs) it becomes trivial to pull in [advanced anomaly detection](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.2/examples/anomaly_detection/) and custom
