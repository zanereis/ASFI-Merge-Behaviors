When POP consumption mode is enabled, I think there are also a large number of network requests, and each topic subscribed by the corresponding client is a network request, which does not seem to solve the problem completely. Transferring to the client side can unify the rebalancing logic. Because it doesn't seem easy to completely isolate POP and PULL rebalancing logic in the original version, and the initial client execution is ideally local
