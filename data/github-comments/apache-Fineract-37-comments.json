Will review this tomorrow.\r\n\r\nNo problems @thesmallstar, appreciated if you can please have a look as the work progresses. Many thanks!\r\nI still believe this is work in progress and would not be a quick win to exhaustively get rid of SQL Injection vulnerabilities.\r\nOne way is to search the codebase on IDE for concatenations and fix to use parameterized queries. \r\n\r\nThe plan here is to use OWASP ZAP to automatically detect SQL Injections and attend to the list in the report from ZAP analysis. \r\nFINERACT-969 has attached html report but that doesn't seem to have scanned Fineract APIs as the output is just on community-app.\r\nI have excluded everything else except SQL Injection on ZAP to scan across Fineract API. I have had to quickly setup local test site with OAuth off to simplify things with OWASP ZAP. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21666131/112750767-36eb4280-9016-11eb-8b1b-11b896bbcd57.png)\r\n\r\nA quick look on `Alerts` tab shows the detected violations. I will use the public link https://www.fineract.dev offered by @vorburger and produce the report which will be analysed for priority fixes in jira sub-tasks. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21666131/112751209-71ee7580-9018-11eb-9579-83dd340e90c5.png)\r\n\r\ncc @vorburger \r\n\r\nSome other things like below will possibly change the design to effectively parameterize the queries. \r\n```\r\n            sql.append(\"emo.error_message as errorMessage \");\r\n            sql.append(\"from \" + tableName() + \" emo\");\r\n```\r\nIdeally SQL string should only be built from string constants and every parameter inserted at runtime as bind variable (placeholder like `?, :name or @name`) in the SQL string and its value set using the `setX()` methods of the `PreparedStatement` class. \r\n\r\nHere `tableName` won't work as a parameter as `FROM` clause won't use setX() methods. This impacts both Security and Performance, and more performance hit if using databases that use a shared execution plan cache like PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/808887055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/808913147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1671#issuecomment-808913147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1671","id":808913147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODkxMzE0Nw==","user":{"login":"josemakara2","id":21666131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjY2MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21666131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2","html_url":"https://github.com/josemakara2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josemakara2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-28T15:34:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T03:22:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The first one to fix here will be as shown in the screenshot. \r\nIt was reported in 29 API URLs \r\n```\r\n> High\tSQL Injection\r\nDescription\tSQL injection may be possible.\r\nURL\thttps://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api/v1/users\r\nMethod\tGET\r\nParameter\tFineract-Platform-TenantId\r\nAttack\tdefault%\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21666131/112757532-d2d87680-9035-11eb-82d0-7335d4e9f7d8.png)\r\n\r\nThe page results were successfully manipulated using the Boolean conditions [default%] and [%e%]\r\n- Condition 1: Data was returned for the original parameter.\r\n- Condition 2: No Data was returned for the manipulated parameter. %e%.

You will still receive a PR once a newer version is released, so if you wish to permanently ignore this dependency, please add it to the `ignoreDeps` array of your renovate config.\n\nIf this PR was closed by mistake or you changed your mind, you can simply rename this PR and you will soon get a fresh replacement PR opened.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/820037958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
