So, I suppose the time at which a new routine is bound to a session depends on when its library file is opened and its NARoutine info is cached. So, imagine this scenario: A library contains two UDFs, F1 and F2. A session opens, references F1. That library is now open, and F1's NARoutine information is cached. Now suppose another session does an ALTER LIBRARY. And after that, suppose the first session references F2. I think what happens is we'll open the new library (because library definitions are not cached, per @sureshsubbiah), and F2 will come from the new library. I'm guessing this is OK, but I wonder what happens if the implementations of F1 and F2 share code within the library. The answers might depend on whether it is C++ or Java (dlopen might have different rules than JVM class paths). It's probably a good idea to think this through a bit and update the documentation with any conclusions you might have. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/225237182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/225238679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/538#issuecomment-225238679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/538","id":225238679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTIzODY3OQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T17:02:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T17:02:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test Failed.  https://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/793/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/225238679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/225246482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/530#issuecomment-225246482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/530","id":225246482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTI0NjQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"sureshsubbiah","id":3596671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshsubbiah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T17:35:48Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T17:35:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Selva, ALTER will not remove files.

made an incorrect statement above. The good news is that stale NARoutine objects will be cleared from NARoutine caches **for all users**. This is due to a change by @robertamarton which I had not considered in my previous responses. Sorry.\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/commit/8e97ff43a7e5324227704cad4ec3e770d521473f\n\nWhen we clear NARoutine object from the local NARoutine cache, it causes through RMS shared memory for the object to be cleared from other caches on the cluster. Please see the method removeNARoutine2 in @robertamarton 's PR. The CLI call causes an SQL_QIKEY to be placed in shared memory, eventually accessible by other executors.\n\nWith this item cleared I think the ALTER LIBRARY statement can be included in the manual.\n\nI checked what type of DDL statements will cause NATable/NARoutine caches to be cleared.\nThis was added by @mikehanlonathpdotcom in https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/commit/1bd19cba4b2c4d43fd78a5a56172ad8bcb153e73 (and 2 subsequent commits). The list has grown since.\n\nI see that these cases are covered. There could be more. \nalter table add column\nalter table add check constraint\nalter table add unique constraint\nalter table add primary key\nalter table add foreign key (RI)\nalter table
