To me it looks like duplicating the serializer only for the meta data should not be required, because the serializer is just written and the getter is only used in a restore, which is never async. You can make an argument that this is just making the code more defensive, which is a good thing.

In theory, even tough the serializer is just written, but if the serializer is stateful (e.g. it maintain a `variable` inside, and do the serializing works according to it and also may update the `variable` according to the serialized result) then it might also lead to concurrency problem if we don't duplicate it. But in practice, I can't find any use cases that need a stateful serializer as far as I can see... So, now I feel lost in duplicating it to be on the safer side in theory or just add some comments without duplicate it to avoid the costs of the duplicating.

I'm quite sure that this work will land in 1.6 but we have to release 1.5 now because it's already late.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385359969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385363620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5941#issuecomment-385363620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5941","id":385363620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTM2MzYyMA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T10:40:01Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T10:40:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"r: @kl0u @StefanRRichter ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385363620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385368595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5924#issuecomment-385368595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5924","id":385368595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTM2ODU5NQ==","user":{"login":"alpinegizmo","id":43608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/alpinegizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T11:07:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T11:07:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\r\n\r\nI frequently see newcomers to Flink getting hung up on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385368595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385412222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5327#issuecomment-385412222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5327","id":385412222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTQxMjIyMg==","user":{"login":"hequn8128","id":4971479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128","html_url":"https://github.com/hequn8128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T14:19:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T14:19:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@twalthr Hi, thanks for your review.

request is not fulfilled: `aeec2a9f010a187e04e31e6efd6f0f88`\r\n\r\nMight be an inconsistency in either in the `SlotManager` or `SlotPool`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385496933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/385497211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5944#issuecomment-385497211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5944","id":385497211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTQ5NzIxMQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T19:04:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T19:04:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Is that the same in the Gradle quickstart?\r\n\r\n  - The Flink core dependencies need to be in a scope equivalent to \"provided\", so they do not end up in the uber jar. Can we do something similar in Gradle? This has been a frequent source of unnecessarily bloated application jars.\r\n\r\n  - The Maven quickstart template uses a trick to make sure that the provided dependencies are still in the classpath when we run the program in the IDE: A profile that activates in IDEA (by a property variable) and alters the scope from *provided* to *compile*.

there is a theoretical problem if the serialization would not be threadsafe. I think currently the silent assumption that holds is that serializers are immutable w.r.t. serialization after they have been created and passed to create a state. I think Stephan's suggestion would be the right approach to materialize that assumption into code and also gain a bit of efficiency.\r\nI think the other concurrency problem is a problem that comes from lazy state registration, and I assume most jobs use de-facto eager state registration, so all the state is registered in `open()` or `initializeState(...)`, and they are never changed at runtime. For the few remaining jobs, there must also be a certain timing that they need to register a new state while a checkpoint is running.

Then we could have a util that wraps a map state into a list state. So the user can register a map state and enhance it to operate as a list state. From Flink's perspective it is still a map state in savepoints and only the user code reinterprets it as list state. Obviously this does not solve the problem of migrating between different list types, but it also does need to introduce a second list type and keeps the window operator as is.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386015370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386019930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5185#issuecomment-386019930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5185","id":386019930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjAxOTkzMA==","user":{"login":"je-ik","id":14139263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTM5MjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14139263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik","html_url":"https://github.com/je-ik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/je-ik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-02T15:32:11Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T15:32:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@StefanRRichter I think that was exactly the initial idea, but then we came into troubles with the savepoints and changing list type.

First, about introducing a separate new state handle. Our long term plan is actually to integrate timers more closely with the backends, so that we can also have a timer service in RocksDB. In general, I would target for reducing the handles(e.g. timers could then be considered also as managed keyed stated) instead of adding more. Second, I would probably suggest a simpler model for the async snapshots. You dropped the idea of making flat copies, but I wonder if this was premature. I can see that calling `set.toArray(...)` per keygroup could (maybe) turn out a bit slow because it has to potentially iterate and flatten linked entries. However, with async snapshots, we could get rid of the key-group partitioning of sets, and instead do a flat copy of the internal array of the priority queue. This would translate to just a single memcopy call internally, which is very efficient. In the async part, we can still partition the timers by key-group in a similar way as the copy-on-write state table does. This would avoid slowing down the event processing path (in fact improving it be unifying the sets) and also keep the approach very straight forward and less invasive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386243808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/386261416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5939#issuecomment-386261416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5939","id":386261416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjI2MTQxNg==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T11:13:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T11:13:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@FredTing Do avoid confusion we should probably close this PR.
