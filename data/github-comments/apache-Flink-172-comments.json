I have updated the PR according to your comments. \r\nThere is one thing need your explanation.i.e. :\r\n`Also, I realized that this implementation (other OVER windows are probably affected as well) will not discard state if the key space evolves. We should add a JIRA to add a configuration parameter to remove state if no row was received for a certain amount of time.`\r\nIMO. For event-time case, we use data-driven management state. each processing a data will be timely processing of expired data. if the data continuously, our state will be promptly processed. If there is no data for a long time, the data in the state will not expand. If the next data is not sure when the arrival of the case, I think we should not clear the data, because the removal of data will lead to the next calculation error. If the state data has TTL settings, user can config TTL which can be friendly to clear the state. If i understand you correctly you said that the configuration parameters, that is the the TTL config, is this correct? If not so, I'm appreciated If you can tell me your detailed thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSunJincheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289972103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289975547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3607#issuecomment-289975547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3607","id":289975547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTk3NTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-29T04:00:00Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T04:00:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, @rtudoran  When open a PR. we should keep our commits based on the latest master branch, so that the PR. only contains the change for this issue and will be clearly for other's review.I had check your `Commits` list and changes.

@tsriharsha!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks a lot for reporting this bug. Contributions in Flink, however, require a corresponding JIRA ticket. In the future, I would recommend always opening a JIRA before the pull request so that other contributors will know that the issue is worked on already (and would therefore avoid race conditions / duplicate work like right now :-D).\r\n\r\nGenerally, the implementation #3637 is cleaner and includes tests for the fix. I think I'll proceed with FLINK-6211 using the patch in #3637. Hope you understand, and welcome more contributions!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290104277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290104601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3637#issuecomment-290104601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3637","id":290104601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDEwNDYwMQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-29T14:19:16Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T14:19:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, thanks a lot for the fix and tests @tony810430!

Those scripts do import `config.sh` but don't use `constructFlinkClassPath` at the moment, related to inclusion of the Hadoop classpath I believe.  But there's potential for unification.\r\n\r\nNote that the `lib` directory is scanned recursively; please verify the behavior in that regard.\r\n\r\nOverall this change seems like a hack attempting to mask a true conflict (reportedly between the Flink and kinesis connector libs).

The following are some of my thoughts.\r\n\r\n* Now the registration of shared states is put in `CheckpointCoordinator` because it's needed whenever a `PendingCheckpoint` receives a state handle or a `CompletedCheckpoint` is recovered. But I think it does make sense to put both the registration and unregistration of shared states in the same place. I will update the PR so that the logics are put in `PendingCheckpoint`s and `CompletedCheckpoint`s.\r\n\r\n* When a `SubtaskState` is not successfully added to the `PendingCheckpoint`, the state objects in the `SubtaskState` should be correctly deleted. The discarding of these `SubtaskState`s varies in different cases. In the case where the `PendingCheckpoint` fails, the `SubtaskState` should delete both its private states and shared states. But in the case where the `CompletedCheckpoint` is subsumed, the `SubtaskState` should delete those unreferenced shared states (possibly created by others) instead of its shared states.   \r\n\r\n  By registering the shared states first, we can unify the implementation in the two cases. Those shared states in the failed `PendingCheckpoint` are always not referenced by other checkpoints. So they can be correctly discarded by the registry when the `PendingCheckpoint` unregisters its shared states, just like a subsumed `CompletedCheckpoint` does.\r\n\r\n  Another choice is refactoring the interface of `CompositeStateHandle`. Three methods, namely `onComplete()`, `onFail()` and `onSubsume()`, will be provided. A`CompositeStateHandle` can implement these methods to correctly deal with its states under these cases.  What do you think?\r\n\r\n* It's a good idea to introduce `SharedStateHandle` for shared states. It can improve the performance and allow safety checks. I will add it in the update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290301880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290304478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3458#issuecomment-290304478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3458","id":290304478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDMwNDQ3OA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T05:13:42Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T05:15:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@skidder Thanks a lot for the testing and the details!
