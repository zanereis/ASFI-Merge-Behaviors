Furthermore, if I remove the `env.setParallelism` call in the `testUserSpecificParallelism` test case, then I can still control the default DOP with `config.setInteger(ConfigConstants.DEFAULT_PARALLELISM, 42)`, for example.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/136969071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/136978688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1032#issuecomment-136978688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1032","id":136978688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjk3ODY4OA==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T08:41:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T08:41:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tillrohrmann , can you review this?\nThis will be a starting point for a package to provide more statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing, correlation, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/136978688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137009547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1026#issuecomment-137009547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1026","id":137009547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzAwOTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T09:57:29Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T09:57:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased to the current master.

the reason why 2 is a \"magic number\" is the following.\nImmagine channels as containers, and the load (the incoming data stream) as a liquid.\nWhen a key is split in two channels, it creates a \"bridge\" between these channels.\nYou can imagine it as a pipe between the two specific containers that enables sharing the load, and brings the liquid to the same level (this happens thanks to the fact that the new messages are sent to the least loaded of the two containers).\nNow, if you have enough of these pipes between pairs of containers, you will effectively establish a network of load sharing among them. Any increase in pressure on one of the containers can be shared across the network effectively, which brings the load balance.\nThe trick is to have \"enough\" keys to create enough pipes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137096426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137098642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1068#issuecomment-137098642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1068","id":137098642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzA5ODY0Mg==","user":{"login":"chenliang613","id":8075709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzU3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8075709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613","html_url":"https://github.com/chenliang613","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenliang613/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T14:21:25Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T14:23:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen

it fails in the middle of writing or before sync/flush is called on the writer then the data can be in an inconsistent state. I see three ways of dealing with this, one is more long-term.\n\nThe long term solution is to make the sink exactly-once aware. Either using truncate() support in Hadoop 2.7 or a custom Thread that does merging of part files and throwing away of data that was erroneously written.\n\nThe two short term options are:\n- Keep it as it is, consumers need to be able to deal with corrupt records and ignore them. This would give you at-least-once semantics.\n- Write to a temporary file. When rolling, close the current bucket and rename the file to the final filename. This would ensure that the output doesn't contain corrupt records but you would have neither at-least-once nor exactly-once semantics because some written records would be lost if checkpoint restore restores to a state after the writing of the current bucket file started.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137125224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137140076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1069#issuecomment-137140076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1069","id":137140076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzE0MDA3Ng==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T15:48:24Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T15:48:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gdfm, thanks for the great explanation. A good way to visualize what's happening.\n\nI'm just wondering why you shouldn't be able to connect more than 2 containers, let's say 3. In cases where you have an extremely high data skew, this might be helpful. Imagine that you have 10 containers and only 2 of them are full. Then in the best case you'll get 4 half filled containers after connecting two containers. But this still leaves 6 unused containers. Wouldn't it be better to connect for example 5 containers in this case? Then in the best case you would use all available containers. But of course this strongly depends on your actual data and therefore I'd vote to make the number of connected containers configurable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137140076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/137143368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1084#issuecomment-137143368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1084","id":137143368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzE0MzM2OA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T15:58:04Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T15:58:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Concerning the second short term option: Is the problem there that the checkpointing is not aligned with the rolling?

I'm assuming you would use this utility to copy files from your local to a remote file system, right? Your utility starts a Flink job to copy the files to the remote file systems. This only works if you execute it locally because otherwise the task managers need to have the files available and that might defeat the utility's purpose. Also, imagine someone embedding the tool in a Flink program. The person might wonder why his/her program actually executes two jobs (one for the utility, one for the actual job). \n\nI think this would be more useful as a utility function, e.g. in a `FileUtils` class in `flink-core`. The method there would receive a list of files and then upload the files like you did using Flink's `FileSystem` abstraction.

I made a simple benchmark on copying 800GB of data within one cluster running Hadoop distcp (using default distcp input format ) and Flink distcp in parallel. Flink job was 1.5 minutes faster (it took approximately 35 minutes in our setup).\n\nSlava\n\n> On 03 Sep 2015, at 17:00, Max notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Thanks for your pull request! I'm assuming you would use this utility to copy files from your local to a remote file system, right? Your utility starts a Flink job to copy the files to the remote file systems. This only works if you execute it locally because otherwise the task managers need to have the files available and that might defeat the utility's purpose. Also, imagine someone embedding the tool in a Flink program. The person might wonder why his/her program actually executes two jobs (one for the utility, one for the actual job).\n> \n> I think this would be more useful as a utility function, e.g. in a FileUtils class in flink-core. The method there would receive a list of files and then upload the files like you did using Flink's FileSystem abstraction.
