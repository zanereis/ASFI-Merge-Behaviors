Please see this ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-994\r\n> When we use `@Tag(\"functional\")` it means the whole test class will be included in a test suite to be run with `-Pfunctional-tests`. The class you deleted here is a pure unit test hence it'd better stay as is. We'll probably come up with a guide about testing here.\r\n\r\nHi, @xushiyan thanks for your explanation.  closing this now","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/683501153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/683503914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2054#issuecomment-683503914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2054","id":683503914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzUwMzkxNA==","user":{"login":"wangxianghu","id":49835526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM1NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49835526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxianghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-31T01:21:48Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T01:21:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @wangxianghu the removal looks good.

I will let @n3nash or @bvaradar to take a call on how to go about this. But I can explain whats happening. \r\n\r\nLets say you insert a row to hudi. (uses simple key gen of col1 as row key and col2 as partition path)\r\n// col1 , col2, col3\r\nrow_key1, pp_1, data_1\r\nWhen its inserted, hudi appends meta columns \r\n// hudi_rowkey, hudi_pp, hudi_fileId, hudi_commit_seq, hudi_commit_time, col1, col2,col3\r\nrow_key1, pp_1, fileId1, abc, def, row_key1, pp_1, data_1\r\n\r\nWith any global index, if you upsert with a different partition path compared to whats in storage and if the config (update partition path) is set to false(default), record will be upserted to original partition path. \r\nRecord being upserted: \r\nrow_key1, pp_2, data_2\r\n\r\nsince pp_2 is different from pp1, this record will be upserted to pp_1. \r\nhence \r\n// hudi_rowkey, hudi_pp, hudi_fileId, hudi_commit_seq, hudi_commit_time, col1, col2,col3\r\nrow_key1, pp_1, fileId1, abc, def, row_key1, pp_2, data_1\r\n\r\nNotice that all data columns are same as passed in (especially pp_2) and only meta columns are fixed to be updated to pp_1. \r\nBut I wonder we might have the same issue w/ any global index. I need to investigate on this further. \r\n\r\nIn the mean time, @simonqin : if you want the record to go into pp_2, try applying this patch and you should see record getting upserted to pp_2. https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1978.
