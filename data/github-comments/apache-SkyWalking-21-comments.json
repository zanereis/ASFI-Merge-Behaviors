I am very interested in .NET agent. I can help you with that. If you want a direct chat channel, I recommend you to join our gitter: https://gitter.im/OpenSkywalking/Lobby . \r\n\r\nLet's be clear with some concepts about OpenTracing first, OK?\r\nOpenTracing is just an APIs layer, didn't include any implementation in any language. So for SKyWalking, it is a SDK interfaces only, you can see we just set a bridge in Java: https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/tree/master/apm-application-toolkit/apm-toolkit-opentracing/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/toolkit/opentracing\r\n\r\nThen, for implement a .NET agent, you should only need to understand our .proto(Google gRPC) protocol, which supports C#: https://grpc.io/docs/\r\n\r\nThe major concept differences between SkyWalking Core and OpenTracing concepts(only in specification level) are:\r\n1. Seperate Span to Entry/Local/Exit Span. Entry and Exit for RPC server and client side, or MQ consumer and provider side. Local means an ordinary method.\r\n2. SkyWalking sw3 head, which propagates through HTTP or other RPC invocations. The protocol is here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/Skywalking-Cross-Process-Propagation-Headers-Protocol-v1.md.
