Why develop this feature, and plan\r\nBecause the misoperation and data model changes in the collector upgrade process may cause some registration data to be lost, if there is a new agent registration, you may get the same id as the agent that lost the metadata, then the subsequent metrics and traces, Not allowed.\r\nFor the loss of metadata, there are two kinds of compensation mechanisms, the agent resends the data in the memory, and the agent re-registers.\r\n\r\n1.1 Re-send\r\nThe agent directly causes the agent to send the data in the memory to the collector, and the collector to the es. However, since it is serially registered, it may be overwritten by the registered data after the es is written. Therefore, this scheme is not adopted.\r\n\r\n1.2 Re-registration\r\nTrigger re-registration by setting the id in the agent-side cache to null\r\n\r\n1.2.1 What method is used?\r\nThere are two ways to re-register, manual triggering and automatic triggering.\r\n\r\n1.2.1.1 Automatic triggering\r\nLoss of metadata due to misoperation is not a defect in the skywalking system. If the reset causes the id of the data before and after the agent to be inconsistent, an exception needs to be thrown to inform the user that his operation has caused the metadata to be lost. Therefore, the method of manually triggering the reset is adopted.\r\n\r\n1.2.1.2 Manual trigger\r\nIf you choose to manually send commands in the management interface, you need to know which agent registration data is lost.

For the metadata missing or partial missing, there is no way the backend could know. Could you info me more about `inconsistent check` mechanism? The only thing in my mind, which doesn't break performance, is when you can't get the name of service/endpoint-ip from cache, you know something is wrong. But this is really part of fact called `inconsistent check`. \r\n\r\nFor me, this could be dangerous to tell people, SkyWalking has `inconsistent check`, because this mechanism can't guarantee **no exception = data is right**.\r\n\r\n> If you choose to manually send commands in the management interface, you need to know which agent registration data is lost. Obviously, the metadata has been lost and there is no way to get it. Similarly, the collector side cannot be manually implemented.\r\n\r\nIf you can't do this manually, I doubt the meaning of this check. This is not a pattern recognition, which AI may do better than human, otherwise, this is a fault check, I am pretty sure, human check is the most reliable thing and the final defence.\r\n\r\n> 1.2.2 How to identify the agent that needs to be re-registered\r\nUniquely determine the instance location by adding the instance_code attribute to the agent.conf configuration file.\r\n\r\nHow is this could identify the `needs to` thing?

Automatic triggering\r\nHow do you know about inconsistent? For the metadata missing or partial missing, there is no way the backend could know. Could you info me more about inconsistent check mechanism? The only thing in my mind, which doesn't break performance, is when you can't get the name of service/endpoint-ip from cache, you know something is wrong. But this is really part of fact called inconsistent check.\r\n\r\nThe id before and after the reset may change, then the metrics aggregated according to the id are not allowed.\r\n\r\n> For me, this could be dangerous to tell people, SkyWalking has inconsistent check, because this mechanism can't guarantee no exception = data is right.\r\n\r\nSkyWalking's consistency check adds instance code to uniquely determine instance to guarantee no-exception=data is right\r\n\r\n> If you can't do this manually, I doubt the meaning of this check. This is not a pattern recognition, which AI may do better than human, otherwise, this is a fault check, I am pretty sure, human check is the most reliable thing and the final defence.\r\n\r\nI am wrong in this place, the server side can also send instructions to the agent reset through the grpc response. But considering this operation is not a common operation and security problem, do not use the server side reset\r\n\r\n>How is this could identify the needs to thing? Could you explain more? Uniquely determine the instance location this is an ID of service instance, yes. Then?\r\n\r\nBy adding an instanceCode to the agent configuration file, which is determined by the operation and maintenance personnel, they can also find the problem agent according to the instanceCode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/418293913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/418318911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1622#issuecomment-418318911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1622","id":418318911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODMxODkxMQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T10:31:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T10:31:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

I doubt there is any compatible test between them.\r\n\r\nSo I am closing this issue. Considering this is not caused by our enhancement, just caused by conflict with 3rd party agent. If you can pinpoint the issue, and send PR, welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/418585632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/418620323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1626#issuecomment-418620323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1626","id":418620323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODYyMDMyMw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T06:57:21Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T06:57:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/18833008/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/18833008)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.004%) to 16.046% when pulling **43f5e592a6b2b6b88f0f6e56c2dab39a10762bde on WithLin:6.x.doc** into **cad40e8465333aa3f981813aa7c6626d68dba1d9 on apache:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/418620323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/418652931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1627#issuecomment-418652931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1627","id":418652931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODY1MjkzMQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T08:54:38Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T08:54:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You have a conflict in this PR.
