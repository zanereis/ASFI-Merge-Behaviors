You have to write this in mx.nd in order to be efficient, Python won't do.\r\n\r\nIf you need a new nonlinearity, not included in mx.nd, you'd have to extend MXNet, in particular src/operator/mshadow_op.h, and also register a new operator. This is a bit tricky, but you can ask me, I just did it.\r\n\r\nBut please do make sure you cannot express your function with existing ones: a lot of things are perfectly possible with mx.nd. Check mx.nd.where, which is useful for your piecewise defined functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/340046338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/340050237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8443#issuecomment-340050237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8443","id":340050237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDA1MDIzNw==","user":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-27T18:31:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T18:31:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"What is your hardware setup?
