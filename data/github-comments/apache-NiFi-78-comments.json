This means if someone scans a table with 1 million rows, all 1 millions will be in memory before being written to the flow file which would not be good for memory usage.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to write row by row to the flow file and never add them to a list.

GetHBase and FetchHBase didn't have this problem because they wrote a row per flow file (which probably wasn't a good idea for GetHBase).\r\n\r\nAs an example scenario, say we have a bunch of rows coming out of this processor using the col-qual-val format like:\r\n```\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:20:07 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:21:03 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n{\"id\":\"\", \"message\":\"The time is Mon Mar 05 10:22:44 EST 2018\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we then created a schema for this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"scan\",\r\n  \"namespace\": \"nifi\",\r\n  \"type\": \"record\",\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    { \"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\" },\r\n    { \"name\": \"message\", \"type\": \"string\" }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen tried to use ConvertRecord with a JsonTreeReader and CsvRecordSetWriter, to convert from JSON to CSV, we get:\r\n```\r\nid,message\r\n\"\",The time is Mon Mar 05 10:20:07 EST 2018\r\n```\r\nIt only ends up converting the first JSON document because the JsonTreeReader doesn't know how to read multiple records unless its a JSON array.\r\n\r\nThere may be cases where the current output makes sense so I'm not saying to change it yet, but just trying to think of what the most common scenario will be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/370470581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/370512333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2478#issuecomment-370512333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2478","id":370512333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDUxMjMzMw==","user":{"login":"bdesert","id":19496093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk2MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19496093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert","html_url":"https://github.com/bdesert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T18:16:57Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T18:16:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende , thank you!\r\nBoth comments make sense.

If you want to create a way to test this you could introduce a new boolean like throwExceptionAfterNumResults and also take in an integer number of results. \r\n\r\nFor quick testing I hacked a change into the MockHBaseClientService so that it throws an exception after the first result:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n@Override\r\n    public void scan(String tableName, String startRow, String endRow, String filterExpression, Long timerangeMin,\r\n            Long timerangeMax, Integer limitRows, Boolean isReversed, Collection<Column> columns, ResultHandler handler)\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n//        if (throwException) {\r\n//            throw new IOException(\"exception\");\r\n//        }\r\n\r\n        // pass all the staged data to the handler\r\n        int resultCount = 0;\r\n        for (final Map.Entry<String,ResultCell[]> entry : results.entrySet()) {\r\n            handler.handle(entry.getKey().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), entry.getValue());\r\n            resultCount++;\r\n\r\n            if (resultCount > 0) {\r\n                throw new IOException(\"exception\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // delegate to the handler\r\n\r\n        numScans++;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThen updated the test case:\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\n    public void testScanWhenScanThrowsException() {\r\n        //hBaseClientService.setThrowException(true);\r\n\r\n        final Map<String, String> cells = new HashMap<>();\r\n        cells.put(\"cq1\", \"val1\");\r\n        cells.put(\"cq2\", \"val2\");\r\n\r\n        final long ts1 = 123456789;\r\n        hBaseClientService.addResult(\"row1\", cells, ts1);\r\n        hBaseClientService.addResult(\"row2\", cells, ts1);\r\n\r\n        runner.setProperty(ScanHBase.TABLE_NAME, \"table1\");\r\n        runner.setProperty(ScanHBase.START_ROW, \"row1\");\r\n        runner.setProperty(ScanHBase.END_ROW, \"row1\");\r\n\r\n        runner.enqueue(\"trigger flow file\");\r\n        runner.run();\r\n\r\n

This is admittedly pretty complicated, but my understanding is as follows:\r\n\r\n- In a case like PutHDFS, snappy compression is supported through the native hadoop library. In this case, the native snappy library is not loaded. Issues seen here are due to multiple classloaders attempting to load \"hadoop\" native library.\r\n- In a case like CompressContent, snappy support is supplied by the native snappy library loaded indirectly through snappy-java. In more recent version, they effectively bypass the native loading issues by copying the native library to a temp directory and loading it with a UUID appended to the name. This allows the native library to be loaded multiple times (since the name is different each time).\r\n- In a case like PutHiveStreaming, snappy support is also supplied through snappy-java. The difference is that its an old version of snappy-java that does not perform the UUID trick. Force upgrading in this case is tricky since it is a transitive dependency (PutHiveStreaming -> Hive -> avro -> snappy). The legacy snappy-java addresses the native library issue by directly injecting the class that loads the native library into the root classloader. The ultimate issue here was that multiple processors were attempting to do this loading at the same time (due to the loading happening in onTrigger). \r\n\r\n@mattyb149 Please chime in here if any of my understanding isn't correct.\r\n\r\nHope this helps","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/371977104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/371993061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2448#issuecomment-371993061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2448","id":371993061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTk5MzA2MQ==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-10T01:55:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-10T01:55:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 Done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/371993061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/372017917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2527#issuecomment-372017917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2527","id":372017917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjAxNzkxNw==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-10T09:55:23Z","updated_at":"2018-03-10T09:55:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thought a bit more about this one and I wondered if someone could be in a situation where they really want a bulletin to be generated when the row is not found.

It may not be perfect, but I don't think NiFi has a way to do a partial commit which is what I'd need to make it work as-is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/372124127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/372134521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2527#issuecomment-372134521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2527","id":372134521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjEzNDUyMQ==","user":{"login":"bdesert","id":19496093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk2MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19496093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert","html_url":"https://github.com/bdesert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdesert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-11T17:51:30Z","updated_at":"2018-03-11T17:51:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 , @bbende In case we want to have bulletin to be generated, we can change \"Bulletin Level\" of the component to \"DEBUG\".
