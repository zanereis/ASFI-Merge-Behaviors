感谢您的回答，我知道您说的这些，您说的是对的，不过我想说的是，因为DubboConfigBindingRegistrar在处理的各个dubbo基础bean（比如ApplicationConfig.class） 的BeanDefinition注册的阶段,就已经需要通过environment加载properties，且这时候还在如果我是用properteis文件配置方式，那么这个时候必须保证我本地有这些properties配置文件，问题是假设系统集成的统一配置管理平台，比如我这边集成了百度的disconf(也是基于spring 处理)，那么他需要去配置文件中心下载properties文件再加载到environment，但该下载动作处理的时刻比前面讲的那个dubbo 基础bean BeanDefinition 注册阶段还晚，显然是有问题。当然我这边是有办法解决，但该问题应该会有很多人碰到。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/355929339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/355936986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1180#issuecomment-355936986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1180","id":355936986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTkzNjk4Ng==","user":{"login":"zuohl","id":10548200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQ4MjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10548200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl","html_url":"https://github.com/zuohl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuohl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-08T11:01:24Z","updated_at":"2018-01-08T11:01:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"你可以自己写拦截器扩展..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/355936986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/355951821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/615#issuecomment-355951821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/615","id":355951821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTk1MTgyMQ==","user":{"login":"artoruis","id":10027451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI3NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10027451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis","html_url":"https://github.com/artoruis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artoruis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-08T12:17:33Z","updated_at":"2018-01-08T12:17:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"the
