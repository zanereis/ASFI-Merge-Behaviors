Is the intent to develop and run several actions in the same project?\n\nYes, but I was more concerned with developing them - at least to the point of having them compile happily. I'm not so much concerned about running them, but... with the struct envelope, they can be run (say, in XCTest unit tests) as:\n\n```\nlet response = SomeWhiskAction().main([\"param\": \"value\"])\n\n// TODO assert stuff about the response\n```\n\nObviously, that gets a little trickier if the action itself needs the OpenWhisk runtime in order to execute.\n\nI did try using closures instead of named functions, but Swift limits what you are allowed to do outside of classes or structs. One of these limitations is that you can't declare an unnamed closure. These limits are lifted if your code is in a file called `main.swift`. But then you would have to write all your actions in that same `main.swift` file, which defeats the purpose as I cannot use the `wsk` CLI to create a single action from a file that defines multiple actions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/216996533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/216999827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/334#issuecomment-216999827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/334","id":216999827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjk5OTgyNw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T20:54:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T20:54:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"you're

In that way, having multiple actions in the same Xcode target wouldn't look to the compiler like they were trying to redefine a global function.\n\nPerhaps another option is to have a backend/runtime object that allows the action developer to specify what they want to run as their action. Something that might look like:\n\n``` swift\n// tell OpenWhisk that my action's implementation consists \n// of the code inside the supplied closure\nWhisk.declareAction { parameters in \n    // my action implementation goes here\n}\n```\n\nNow that I've written that all out... this seems quite a bit nicer than the struct envelope that requires peeling away before running the action.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/217458468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/217493308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/345#issuecomment-217493308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/345","id":217493308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzQ5MzMwOA==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T16:39:09Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T16:39:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was initially confused by \"feed\" as well and the relationship between feeds and triggers.

there, the idea for the enhancement was actually quite simple:\nFor all commands which can be issued from the wsk CLI tool, provide an option --api-url which outputs the REST URL to run the same command. This is not limited to invoking actions but also creating triggers, enabling/disabling rules etc. \nI know about the Swaggerfile, but since the wsk tool is so convenient users might find it helpful there too.\n\nHow did I come up with this idea? \nI wanted to know how I could invoke an action or fire a trigger via curl, both for testing/learning purposes as well as later integration with my existing server based code. The last part is especially important to me, as I discovered that all my (personal) applications etc talk HTTP to each another (at least as the default).  \n\nAnother use case is automatic creation of environments, e.g. I want to provide a Whisk application as a \"deployable\" package, which could consist of a bunch of .js files and a bash script which creates also entities via curl calls. To find the proper calls I can again either consult the Swaggerfile (if I know where it is burried ;-)) or just  give the --api-url flag to the calls I used during development time. An extension from this idea is to also generate payloads from the --param option flags. \n\nFor example Cloudant provides similar functionality in their web console; you can always copy an URL from the top right.       \n\nFeel free to ask any follow-up questions, I gladly participate.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/217643835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/217644329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/350#issuecomment-217644329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/350","id":217644329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzY0NDMyOQ==","user":{"login":"mbehrendt","id":4745697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4745697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt","html_url":"https://github.com/mbehrendt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbehrendt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-07T15:27:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-07T15:27:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"wouldn't `wsk -v <command>` address this requirement?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/217644329/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/217645440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/350#issuecomment-217645440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/350","id":217645440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzY0NTQ0MA==","user":{"login":"julicjung","id":12299771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjk5Nzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12299771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung","html_url":"https://github.com/julicjung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julicjung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-07T15:36:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-07T15:36:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just tried it.
