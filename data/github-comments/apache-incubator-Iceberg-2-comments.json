Otherwise, the inclusive projection will be null and the predicate will be converted to `alwaysTrue` to match partition values resulting in much larger than necessary table scans.\r\n\r\nFor background, a projection is the predicate converted to work on partition values. The *inclusive* projection is one that must match any partition that contains a matching value, even if those partitions contain values that don't match. (The *strict* projection is one that matches a partition if all values in the partition must match the original predicate.)\r\n\r\nFor example, if a table is partitioned by `part0=truncate(str, 4)` then partitions are created by taking the first 4 characters of column `str`. The inclusive projection of `startsWith(str, \"aa\")` is `startWith(part0, \"aa\")` because all values that match the predicate must be in partitions that start with \"aa\". Similarly, the inclusive projection of `startsWith(str, \"aaaaa\")` is `startsWith(part0, \"aaaa\")` or `equal(part0, \"aaaa\")` because all values that match must be in partition \"aaaa\". Note that the partition \"aaaa\" also includes the value \"aaaab\" that doesn't match the original data predicate, which is why we call it the \"inclusive\" projection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/453858053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/453858216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/47#issuecomment-453858216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/47","id":453858216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzg1ODIxNg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-13T19:29:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-13T19:29:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This was fixed by #52.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/453858216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/453858511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/23#issuecomment-453858511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/23","id":453858511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzg1ODUxMQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-13T19:33:42Z","updated_at":"2019-01-13T19:33:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After talking with @vinooganesh, @yifeih, and @mccheah, we decided that the use case was to be able to hook into the logic that creates file paths.

You'll need to update any `Transform` that can project a `startsWith` predicate. That is any transform that can handle strings.\r\n\r\nProjection takes a predicate on data values (e.g. `startsWith(str, \"aa\")`) and returns a predicate that accepts partition values. The translation isn't perfect, so there are two types: inclusive and strict, that make different guarantees.\r\n\r\nFor example, when you search for `ts > '2019-01-01T00:00:00'`, that's a predicate on data values (the `ts` column).  If your table is partitioned by day, Iceberg needs to use that predicate to match the stored partition values, in order to select the files that may contain data that match your query. Iceberg \"projects\" the predicate using the partition spec for a table. In this case, the transform `day` is used because the spec uses it on the same column, `ts`. That projects the predicate to `ts_day >= '2019-01-01'`, which can be run on the `ts_day` partition values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/453874634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/454017882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/72#issuecomment-454017882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/72","id":454017882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDAxNzg4Mg==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T14:12:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T14:12:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This LGTM.

At least for tests, a package-private version that defaults to case sensitive would cut down on a lot of code changes.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/456511762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/456595316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/82#issuecomment-456595316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/82","id":456595316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjU5NTMxNg==","user":{"login":"xabriel","id":218555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODU1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel","html_url":"https://github.com/xabriel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabriel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-22T22:55:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T22:55:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> What do you think about adding versions of these methods that don't have the flag and default to case sensitive?\r\n\r\nI do think that that users of `Binder#bind` should be forced to make a choice, otherwise iceberg will evolve, get new committers, and some future PR will use default behavior from `Binder#bind(StructType struct, Expression expr)`, thus inadvertently not honoring the new configuration flag that would come in a follow up PR to this one.\r\n\r\n> At least for tests, a package-private version that defaults to case sensitive would cut down on a lot of code changes.\r\n\r\nA package-private version its ok with me if you think it will make this PR easier to follow.

This is a way to handle leaks so that you get nice warning messages instead of failing applications when a resource pool runs out.\r\n\r\nIceberg already uses try-with-resources and is careful about cleaning up open files internally, but it also returns open streams to callers as `CloseableIterable` instances.
