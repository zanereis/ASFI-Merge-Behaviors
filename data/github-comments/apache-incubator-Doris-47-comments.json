are usually some tables added columns at the same time, and now these table are loaded data all time by stream load, so We hope that adding column operation can be accomplished as soon as possible, or stream load can be more slower when it should write two copies of data. now, it waste time to sleep and schema change jobs will affect each other, so here I change the interval for schema change check
