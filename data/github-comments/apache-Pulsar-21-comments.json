Good point, I think the reference version would be the one used in the Jenkins build, since it will be used to do the validation and it will reject PRs with unconforming code.\r\n\r\nRight, and we need to choose the version carefully. Because packaged clang-format is sometimes too old (or new), you would need to build it by yourself in that case and too newer versions might bring some build issue on older platforms.\r\n\r\n> We should point out the version in the docs to make it clear\r\n\r\nIt'll be a good start.

Probably, at least one version is available on any popular OS's packaging systems, but I'm not sure whether the version is 4.0. If I simply install clang-format package with Homebrew, the version is 6.0. I think it would be 3.x if it was CentOS6, which is not EOLed yet.
