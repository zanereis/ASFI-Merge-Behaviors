See [main](https://github.com/apache/solr/compare/main...tboeghk:solr:main-bench?expand=1) and [PR1155](https://github.com/tboeghk/solr/compare/main...tboeghk:solr:issues/solrcores-finer-locking-bench?expand=1).\r\n\r\nMain points are:\r\n\r\n1. I think you actually need to do something while holding the lock like it is in reality. So I've tried to mimic the behaviour of open() and close(). I set the parameter incRefCount to true in order to do something and I set doAnswer on SolrCore mock but it didn't work as expected. Basically you can't call a method intercepted by mockito inside your benchmarking function, because it will ruin it with lots of GC. The reason for this behaviour are those method interceptors and stacktrace objects, which all want to be GCed. I avoided that by introducing a consumer to do some work while the lock is being held:\r\n```java \r\nSolrCore getCoreFromAnyList(String name, boolean incRefCount, UUID coreId, Consumer<SolrCore> callback) {\r\n    READ_WRITE_LOCK.readLock().lock();\r\n    try {\r\n      SolrCore core = getCoreFromAnyList(name, incRefCount, coreId);\r\n      callback.accept(core);\r\n      return core;\r\n    } finally {\r\n      READ_WRITE_LOCK.readLock().unlock();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. I think one should limit the number of threads to the number of CPU cores, otherwise you're benchmarking context switching of OS threads.\r\n\r\nTo get an overview which public methods from SolrCores and CoreContainer are actually called and how frequent, I've checked a recent flight recorder image from one of our production machines. I was wondering if benchmarking getCoreFromAnyList() is sufficient to model the behaviour of our system. This is a 20 Minute frame without creation of a new Core. Here the distribution is in relation to the number of request calls.\r\n  1. Requests 100%\r\n  2. CoreContainer.getCore(String) 57% <--- this calls solrCores.getCoreFromAnyList\r\n  4. CoreContainer.getRequestHandler(String) 36% <--- doesn't lock\r\n  5. SolrCores.getCoreDescriptor(String) 12% <--- locks\r\n  6. CoreContainer.getCore(String, UUID) 9% <--- this calls solrCores.getCoreFromAnyList\r\n\r\nHere are my benchmark result runs:\r\n\r\nThe synchronized one:\r\n```\r\n$ cat results-synchronized.txt

@iamsanjay \r\n\r\nJust wanted to give you a short update on my lack of progress on this.  It is definitely still on my radar, but there are a few things that are holding it up at this point:\r\n\r\n1. As you pointed out elsewhere, the JAX-RS integration in Solr doesn't yet have a mechanism to read config values out of solrconfig.xml, which is kindof a serious blocker for this ticket.  That's on my short list to get to, and once it's resolved I plan to circle back to merging this.\r\n2. Additionally, there's been some discussion in the community recently about how the recent addition of the JAX-RS framework has affected (or, more pointedly, slowed down) Solr startup in some cases.  That's turned into a big blocker, and there's even talk of deferring the release of our JAX-RS v2 APIs until that perf regression can be mitigated.  Most of my focus has shifted to that - after all, it's not much good focusing on individual JAX-RS APIs if shipping the whole framework gets delayed 😛 (see SOLR-16531 for more details)\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's all to say that I haven't gotten to this PR, but that I haven't forgotten it or let it fall off my radar.  I'm just focusing on a few blockers that need wrapped up, and plan to return to this when that's finished.
