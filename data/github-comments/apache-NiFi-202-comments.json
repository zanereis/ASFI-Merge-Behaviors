Yes, we can implement it in a follow-on task.\r\n\r\nFor example, the list processors allow clearing the state manually if the user wants to start over and list all items again. The state is cleared automatically if there is a configuration change that needs reset (e.g. setting a new base directory for listing and in this case using the previous last file timestamp does not make sense for the new directory). These processors can store the state (last timestamp) only for one target, that's why automatic reset is needed on config change.\r\nConsumeAzureEventHub stores the state tagged by the target, that't why it is possible to store states for multiple targets. The drawback is that the old data is also transferred back and forth between NiFi and the state provider continuously.

However, if a node is part of a cluster and temporarily has cluster communication problems, this is different than manually disconnecting and removing the node from the cluster. With that background, I don't think that scenario should be a concern because switching cluster membership should be a manual process. Are you observing different behavior?\r\n\r\nWith that background, it seems like this should be close to completion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1890155711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1890170771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8012#issuecomment-1890170771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8012","id":1890170771,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5wqbeT","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-13T00:16:53Z","updated_at":"2024-01-13T00:16:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mark-bathori Since it has been several months, and there have been significant framework dependency upgrades, I'm closing this pull request for now.

There might be cases we're an existing enum (e.g. from a library) is used that cannot be altered. Even though I'd personally prefer creating one's own enum (implementing DescribedValue) that maps to the library one (similar to the azure bundle) I can see how someone might not want to go \"the extra mile\". A user can use that Enum as allowableValues more easily now. \r\n2. And by far more important to me, I noticed that when using the existing `public <E extends Enum<E>> Builder allowableValues(final E[] values)` with an enum that actually implements DescribedValue, those values will be ignored, which might come as a surprise. I wouldn't want to restrict the Enums to implement DescribedValue here, as that would be quite a large breaking change. That's why I thought aligning the behaviour of all Enum based methods would be beneficial for ease of understanding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1892742398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1892750763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8211#issuecomment-1892750763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8211","id":1892750763,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5w0RWr","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-15T20:50:33Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T20:50:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the quick reply @EndzeitBegins.

Good to know that a temporarily disconnected node behaves differently.\r\n\r\nRegarding the manual disconnection, I found a relatively easy way to check it:\r\n- add `isClustered` entry in the `LOCAL` scope, set it only when it is unset (first start-up or after manual state clean-up)\r\n- check its value in the `CLUSTER` scope (from where the checkpoints are retrieved)\r\n- if the entry is not found, it is fine as we are really accessing the cluster scope, so the node is currently connected to the cluster\r\n- if the entry is found and it is `true`, then it is an originally clustered node but is currently accessing the local state via the cluster scope => the node is disconnected and it must not write the state\r\n- if the entry is found and it is `false`, then it is a standalone node => OK\r\n\r\nI added this change along with 2 other commits improving tests and error handling.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1894716050/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1894866499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8015#issuecomment-1894866499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8015","id":1894866499,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5w8V5D","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-17T03:10:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T03:10:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rliszli

Thank you for working on this @dan-s1. 👍🏻\r\n> \r\n> I haven't done a full code review so I might've just overlooked something. But I noticed that the package names of the processors change due to the move from the standard-nar to the new jolt-nar. From my understanding this will result in the processors needing to be replaced manually on the canvas between version updates, or is there a migration in place for this sort of change? If not, and the user needs to replace those processors themself, I don't think we need to migrate properties as there won't be any instance of the processor existing anyway.\r\n\r\n@EndzeitBegins I am not sure the answer to your question.
