> only when the HoodieMergeHandle is called, not always. And other scenarios can re-use the existing files.\r\n> \r\n> For HoodieCreateHandle, we deduce `op` on the fly since the beforeImage will be null for inserts? I think we are close enough here to begin implementation. Is the next step to get a more detailed design updated here in RFC? as @danny0405 mentioned?\r\n\r\nIt seems we make consensus that for COW table:\r\n\r\n    1. for create handle, we deduce the _op directly from the record because they are all INSERTs\r\n    2. for merge handle, we can deduce the before image on the fly when reading by comparing two \r\n        different versions of file slice and there is no need to write another cdc block.\r\n\r\nFine with that.\r\n\r\nFor MOR table, from my perspective what i can imagine is:\r\n\r\n    1. we also deduce the before image on the fly just like the COW table does, which is heavy for readers like i mentioned\r\n    2. we write cdc blocks when writing, there is one exception is when the file slice is the first version, no cdc block is needed\r\n    3. the cdc block contains the complete before image for each change ? Not very clear what the cdc block payload should \r\n        be like here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149711512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149735848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5634#issuecomment-1149735848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5634","id":1149735848,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Eh5Oo","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T10:22:02Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T10:22:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The bucket index has some bugs though, let'w wait for the 0.11.1 release.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149735848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149737683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5671#issuecomment-1149737683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5671","id":1149737683,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Eh5rT","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T10:24:27Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T10:24:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"But why the delta commit does not be rolled back ?

But i know this , Maybe the delta commit failed due to which known reasons,that hudi table creates a new partition at a new hour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149802860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149822369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5671#issuecomment-1149822369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5671","id":1149822369,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EiOWh","user":{"login":"eric9204","id":90449228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDQ5MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90449228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204","html_url":"https://github.com/eric9204","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric9204/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T11:59:54Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T11:59:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90449228/172610956-2e9059ee-eba5-4622-a405-57dfe4a85916.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149822369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1149832724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5723#issuecomment-1149832724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5723","id":1149832724,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EiQ4U","user":{"login":"boneanxs","id":10115332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTE1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10115332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs","html_url":"https://github.com/boneanxs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T12:10:44Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T12:10:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @boneanxs Left a comment.

HoodieCreateHandle is also used in COW table, can we describe the behavior specifying the table type first, that is more clear, and it is better to submit the code after we make consensus.\r\n\r\nAccording to the code call chain in Spark, `HoodieCreateHandle` is referenced in `handleInsert` of `HoodieSparkCopyOnWriteTable`, but the real caller is the sub-classed of `HoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableCompactor`. So i think the cow table will not use it directly. \r\n\r\nand whether write out the cdc block is up to the `HoodieWriteHandle`, not the table type. So it is not necessary to describe the behavior for table type.\r\n\r\nI would write unit tests for different table types and determine exactly what write operations should have CDC files. They maybe will help you to understand.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1150084226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1150342257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5778#issuecomment-1150342257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5778","id":1150342257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EkNRx","user":{"login":"bhasudha","id":2179254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzkyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha","html_url":"https://github.com/bhasudha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhasudha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-08T19:55:59Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T19:55:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for flagging this @codope .

up on the discussion. \r\n\r\nHoodieCreateHandle is directly used by the insert part of COW and MOR. The compactor uses MergeHandle, not CreateHandle and we can pass a flag in that path, to make it skip writing any CDC flags.\r\n \r\n<img width=\"631\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1179324/172764081-bb3d0d5a-d268-48f4-b84a-197867b943fd.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our discussions, we are talking about knowledge of inserts and updates, based on the write handle used. But, when we do the query, we don't know anything. So we need to design this even more generically at the file group/slice level. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy proposal here https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5436#issuecomment-1143251715 was different from what you wrote - @danny0405 .  \r\n \r\n```\r\n1. for create handle, we deduce the _op directly from the record because they are all INSERTs\r\n2. for merge handle, we can deduce the before image on the fly when reading by comparing two \r\n    different versions of file slice and there is no need to write another cdc block.\r\n```\r\nFor 1 - we don't know during querying whether this file slice was produced by create handle or merge handle. So for a create handle with N records, we write a CDC log block with N entries, each with  `{op=I, before=null}`. \r\n\r\nFor merge handle, it can be updates/deletes and even inserts. For update/delete, their before can be in the base file of current slice, or on a base/log of previous slice. There are two options.  \r\n1. if `hoodie.cdc.supplemental.logging=true`, we perform the read to obtain all before images for update and delete record and write a CDC block with one entry for each `{op=U or D, before=value_read_from_base_or_previous_slice}`\r\n2. if `hoodie.cdc.supplemental.logging=false`, then we don't calculate the before now and just encode `{op=U or D, before=null or some sentinel}`. During read, if op = U or D and there is no before image, we go ahead/read and compute `before`. the `after` image can be read normally from the file slice for `I` and `U`\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1150688635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1150696342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5806#issuecomment-1150696342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5806","id":1150696342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5EljuW","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T05:46:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T05:46:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"bb6f88740becb2a01981acbccb13782b32ebc465\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=9177\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"bb6f88740becb2a01981acbccb13782b32ebc465\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* bb6f88740becb2a01981acbccb13782b32ebc465 Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=9177) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -
