We can get rid of that my just setting the dependency on hbase-endpoint in phoenix-core, I think. At least, I think that would be the cleanest way to work around it.\r\n\r\nI think I've convinced myself that renaming the compat modules from 2.y.z to 2.y is a good idea. If there is some .z release which doesn't work for Phoenix, let's just preclude that value from being set by creating a maven-enforcer-plugin in that compat module's profile to fail on that value.\r\n\r\nThe builtin rule RequireProperty lets us do exactly that (sadly, not via the nice version range syntax) with a regex like `2\\.2\\.[1-9]`. Recognizing that this will fail if we get to `2.2.10`, we can also write a custom enforcer rule which would do exactly what we want.

We don't need separate compat modules for (most of) 2.1.x and 2.2, but would it reduce user-error to make a profile that just activates `phoenix-compat-hbase-2.2` when the user sets `-Dhbase.compat.version=2.1`?\r\n\r\nIn HBase, when dealing with Hadoop dependencies, we have a property named `hadoop.profile` which is doing the same thing you're doing for HBase now. It would be nice for consistency to rename `hbase.compat.version` to be `hbase.profile`.\r\n\r\nI'll go through the rest of the code-changes, but I think, with the above, I am happy with the build-system level changes :) Awesome work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/580447053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/580698111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/687#issuecomment-580698111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/687","id":580698111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDY5ODExMQ==","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-31T11:32:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T11:32:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It looks like omid is bringing in a custom version of hbase-endpoint to the assembly (looking at the bin tarball's lib directory):\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> [INFO] --- maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.1:tree (default-cli) @ phoenix-assembly ---\r\n> [INFO] org.apache.phoenix:phoenix-assembly:pom:5.1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n> [INFO] +- org.apache.phoenix:phoenix-core:jar:5.1.0-SNAPSHOT:compile\r\n> [INFO] |  +- org.apache.omid:omid-hbase-shims-hbase2.x:jar:1.0.1:compile\r\n> [INFO] |  |  +- org.apache.hbase:hbase-endpoint:jar:2.0.1:compile\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nActually, just adding it to parent DependencyManagement is sufficient.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of transactions, we know that tephra does not support HBase 2.2. \r\nThis is something that we will have to resolve, preferably after this is commited \r\n(i.e. in the initial version, I think it's OK not to have working tephra for 2.2)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/580698111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/580715890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/687#issuecomment-580715890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/687","id":580715890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDcxNTg5MA==","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-31T12:33:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T12:33:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> In HBase, when dealing with Hadoop dependencies, we have a property named `hadoop.profile` which is doing the same thing you're doing for HBase now.

I do like the branch merging work but I don't really think this is the right approach in our tests.  Either we should break out the tests and exclude them in your newly created profiles.  Or have a hbase-compat interface that we can query about functionality.  As HBase/Phoenix continue to evolve something like that would likely be useful for maintaining the versions/changes.  Essentially a class that has isHbaseMetricsApiAdapterAvailable and then underneath you could have this class loader approach.  The tests, or other classes could then call into this interface for determining code flow.  Thoughts @stoty  ?
