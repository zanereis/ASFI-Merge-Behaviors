It only applies to position deletes?\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\n>My primary worry is that this would require a spec change and quite a bit of code to populate the new value. For instance, we currently only track file names when writing position deletes. After this, we would have to project and keep track of the sequence number per each referenced data file. Even after all of that, we can still get false positives.\r\n\r\nYes,  it does need a field as added in this PR.  It may need to track the sequence number of reference data files in spark MoR mode since we could populate the null value at first and populate the correct value in a later rewrite action. But anyway, it does get a false positive as you mentioned. While in the Flink upsert case, it always has a lazy value and thus no false positive problem. \r\n\r\n>I am currently working on an alternative planning for position deletes in Spark, where I want to open files in a distributed manner and squash them into a bitmap per data file. This would give us a reliable way to check if delete files apply and would also avoid the need to open the same delete file multiple times for different data files.\r\n\r\nSounds cool and promising, look forward to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1528310117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1528316419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7465#issuecomment-1528316419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7465","id":1528316419,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bGEID","user":{"login":"singhpk234","id":35593236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTkzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35593236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234","html_url":"https://github.com/singhpk234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singhpk234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-29T00:36:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-29T00:36:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"linking previous discussions: \r\n- https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7071","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1528316419/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1528352395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7465#issuecomment-1528352395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7465","id":1528352395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bGM6L","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-29T01:00:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-29T01:01:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, I did not know there was a previous discussion!

The InMemoryCatalog can be found @: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/251c9fa796157b06fc89e18fbb9a43045f459b07/python/tests/catalog/test_base.py#L52 \r\n\r\nWhile the only reference I found to MockCatalog (as-typed) is @: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/251c9fa796157b06fc89e18fbb9a43045f459b07/python/tests/cli/test_console.py#L103\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, would you like to see the /python/test/cli/test_console.py updated so that the MockCatalog is inherited from InMemoryCatalog found in test_base.py? Since they both inherit from Catalog class? Further, would InMemoryCatalog remain housed in test_base.py and have this imported from test_console.py? Or a new python file called test_catalogs.py (for example) created in /python/test/catalog/ to be imported from and used? \r\n\r\nAnother option is the removal of reference to MockCatalog in test, and just reference InMemoryCatalog, but again would need to either have it imported from test_base.py or moved to its own python file to imported from. \r\n\r\nEither way I can complete this scope of work.
