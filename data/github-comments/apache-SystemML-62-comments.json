My laptop would crash while using Virtual box with Ubuntu. :(\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1719220189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1719285147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1843#issuecomment-1719285147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1843","id":1719285147,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5mejWb","user":{"login":"anishsapkota","id":68165368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTY1MzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68165368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota","html_url":"https://github.com/anishsapkota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishsapkota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T11:38:02Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T11:38:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Baunsgaard @j143 , could you please let the last commit run?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1719285147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1719324701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1843#issuecomment-1719324701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1843","id":1719324701,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5metAd","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T12:07:29Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T12:08:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"maybe the tests run on your fork?

Rest assured, I will address all of them after my presentation.\r\n> \r\n> could you be more specific, how can I make the comparison fairer? I will be incorporating your previous suggestions of calculating std and analysing dml execution time using -stats flag. Do you have any further suggestions? It would be interesting for the presentation to address this issue before that.\r\n\r\nThe fairest comparison would be to integrate the native instruction as a DML supported command. It does not take long to make. But requires you to know where to do it. \r\nOnce integrated we can compare with the overhead of the system on both executions and thereby get a fair comparison. \r\n\r\nFor now the stats comparison is close enough.

Other than that the translate operator in the first PR had some serious performance issues. I have tried to change it as much as possible. I did get rid of one of the loops. In the initial implementation we were assigning values to every index one by one which was inefficient for large matrices. This is not the case anymore. I also used parfor for the outer loop which helped with the performance. I have tried to compare it with the non linear translate operator with random matrices that are 512x512 size. It seems aproximately when we call it with more than 10 images . the linear function seems to catch up to the non linear one . I did this by comparing the system DS execution time that appears after the terminal after compiling the script. Is there a better way of comparing ? I think I could also compare with the time command but it gives 3 different measurements ( real, sys and .. ) I didnt know which one I should primarly focus on. I also added the dml script for test and the java test and looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nGood progress.\r\n\r\n- Please experiment with other image sizes like non square images, and larger/smaller  sizes, i suggest up to 8k by 8k and down to 64 by 64. \r\n- I suggest adding the -stats flag to the execution and use the time of the image function call, and please do it in a loop like:\r\n```\r\nres = read($1)\r\nprint(sum(res))\r\nfor(i in 1:$2) {\r\n    res2 = OPERATION(res)\r\n}\r\nprint(sum(res2))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- For the time command you get 3 values yes, user system and total. User is wall clock that is most likely the one you want to use if you want to time the entire execution. I recommend not to do so for your use case, unless you are measuring a sequence of image operations.\r\n\r\nIf i missed something in the text just ask again :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1725404341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1729453384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1845#issuecomment-1729453384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1845","id":1729453384,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5nFV1I","user":{"login":"slnkahveci","id":76944633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTQ0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76944633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci","html_url":"https://github.com/slnkahveci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slnkahveci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-21T12:17:32Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T12:17:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Baunsgaard The script and the test are working but the checks keep failing.

Follow the examples of `RewriteMatrixMultChainOptTest` and `RewriteMatrixMultChainOptTest2`.\r\n- Try to integrate the new rewrites in self-contained functions. This way we can easily disable the new rewrites if we encounter bugs or harmful impacts. You can also add static flags to enable/disable the rewrites (e.g. `PUSH_DOWN_TRANSPOSE = true`).\r\n- Export developer code style (/dev/CodeStyle_eclipse.xml) to avoid unintended diffs such as space

tabs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1826899850/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1833360660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1950#issuecomment-1833360660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1950","id":1833360660,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5tRt0U","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-30T09:06:04Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T09:06:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dependabot

You can utilize the `Statistics.getCPHeavyHitterCount` module (e.g. matching the number of `transpose`). Rewrites often contradict. This assertion will detect if a future rewrite unintentionally reverts your changes.\r\nI also recommend adding few more tests with different matmult patterns, such as using the same input multiple times so that the `mmchain` operator is used (check the `mmchain` tests).\r\nDo not worry about the federated test failure. That is not due to your changes. Please rebase on main once Sebastian fixes the issue there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1838396747/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1838434697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1885#issuecomment-1838434697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1885","id":1838434697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5tlEmJ","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-04T11:25:37Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T11:25:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the unfortunate truth is we need to tests this update more than some of the other updates, since we rely on spark internals quite a lot.
