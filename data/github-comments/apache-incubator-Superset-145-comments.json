I'm not sure of the best language here, it seems like \"range\" is really just smart defaults for choosing the start date? will continue to think on this\r\n- I like having both the radio buttons + dropdown in the same window pane, IMO it doesn't seem useful to have the radio buttons stand on their own.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391074382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391081201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4981#issuecomment-391081201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4981","id":391081201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTA4MTIwMQ==","user":{"login":"michellethomas","id":817955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/817955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas","html_url":"https://github.com/michellethomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-22T17:49:13Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T17:49:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For `Start/End` it would be nice to have the language make it clear if the range will be inclusive or exclusive.

As Max pointed out they should be visually consistent. The tabs in the gif look a bit like buttons to me. \r\n\r\nI agree with Chris that \"Range\" and \"Start/End\" are confusing since they are both types of ranges. I also view the use of \"range\" in this context as a type of smart default.\r\n\r\n**A few thoughts:**\r\n\r\n- Regardless of what route we take, we should improve the label clarity.\r\n- Could we separate smart defaults into one tab and the user's ability to pick a custom range into another? This would mean moving the current last option from \"range\" into the second tab.\r\n- I think the separation illustrated below would help separate the two types of user desire: 1. give me great defaults and 2. give me the ability to customize them when they don't meet my needs.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n**Defaults**\r\n- [Yesterday]\r\n- [Last week]\r\n- [Last month]\r\n- [Last year]\r\n\r\n**Custom**\r\n- [Last v] [#] [days v]\r\n- [Start date]\r\n- [End date]\r\n\r\nAn open question I have that effects the order of the tabs is what will people use most often? We should order accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391194442/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391201901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5053#issuecomment-391201901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5053","id":391201901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTIwMTkwMQ==","user":{"login":"qin4zhang","id":10649428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ5NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10649428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/qin4zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-23T02:38:23Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T02:38:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@TianyangLi I wil try to use 0.25.5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391201901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391202017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5054#issuecomment-391202017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5054","id":391202017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTIwMjAxNw==","user":{"login":"qin4zhang","id":10649428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ5NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10649428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/qin4zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qin4zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-23T02:39:23Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T02:39:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I will try to use 0.25.5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391202017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/391226147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4979#issuecomment-391226147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4979","id":391226147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTIyNjE0Nw==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-23T05:36:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T05:36:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM!
