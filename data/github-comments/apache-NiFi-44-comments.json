For me, that should be NiFi DBCPService, because it provides control via NiFi UI or REST API to users. If we expose the DataSource instance itself, other components can alter or close the data source and it can cause unexpected behavior. For example, a custom processor gets data source from DBCPService, then the processor closes the data source unintentionally, then all other processors depending on the same DBCPService will stop working.\r\n\r\nAs for wrapping DBCPService outside, as long as it provides what JdbcTemplate needs, then it should be a right solution. Wrapping it outside of NiFi is nothing wrong to do. On the other hand, removing a method from NiFi framework is harder than adding it. We need to have a good reason to add one to maintain it for a long term.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything specific that doesn't work with that approach, it's easier to discuss.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/277563191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/277697245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1422#issuecomment-277697245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1422","id":277697245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzY5NzI0NQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-06T14:27:39Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T14:27:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@trixpan thanks for the contrib!  @jfrazee thanks for the review.

However you can now specify the locale to use with:\r\n````\r\nmvn clean install -Dmaven.surefire.arguments=\"-Duser.language=fr -Duser.region=FR\"\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd I confirm that the test is failing as \"expected\".\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/278267455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/278350791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1302#issuecomment-278350791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1302","id":278350791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODM1MDc5MQ==","user":{"login":"skrewz","id":3256785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTY3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3256785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz","html_url":"https://github.com/skrewz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skrewz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T14:56:43Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T14:56:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As-of 2c5d5fd, reckon we're good.
