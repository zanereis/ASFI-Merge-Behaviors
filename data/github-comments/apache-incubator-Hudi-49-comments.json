The user extends this abstract class and plugs that custom class to `--transformer-class` param. So the difference is: transformer list is supplied from user's code instead of being parsed from CLI args. \r\n\r\nMy reasoning for this implementation is: it saves some parsing logic to maintain and users could have more flexibility in how they supply transformers (via their own code).\r\n\r\nThough saying that, I don't mind making the transformers parsed from CLI.

It's just about trade-off. Both of them can achieve the same function, but the mechanism of collecting `Transformer` is different.

Basically something like a user is running 2 pipelines - pipeline A (using deltaStreamer consuming from kafka, say) and pipeline B (using some other reconciler writing to some other path). Now whenever user finds A is having some issue in terms of data quality, user would like to consume from output of B using DFS source for A and again switch back to kafka for A? And this thing can happen n number of times. Also would like to hear from @vinothchandar on this use case.
