Here's my best effort.<br/>\nRegarding fixing <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2546\" title=\"Kafka spout can stall / get stuck due to edge case with failing tuples\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2546\"><del>STORM-2546</del></a>:<br/>\nThe only way to know that a tuple has been deleted from Kafka is to try polling for it. We can know for sure that a failed tuple has been deleted if we seek to the failed tuple's offset (or earlier) on the relevant partition and poll, and we then encounter a tuple that has a higher offset than the failed tuple on that partition earlier in the result set.</p>\n\n<p>For instance:<br/>\nOffset 0...5 have failed and also been compacted away. Offset 6 has failed and is present, offset 7 has failed and is not present.<br/>\nWe seek to offset 0 for the partition.<br/>\nIf we then see that the first message in the poll result is offset 6, we can be sure that offset 0...5 are deleted, because otherwise they would have been returned in the poll. Offset 7 cannot be removed from the spout because we can't be sure that it was deleted, the consumer may just have received too few messages.</p>\n\n<p>I believe we can also conclude that offsets have been removed if we seek to their offsets, poll and receive an empty result. I'm not entirely sure about this, but I don't think the consumer will return empty polls if there are more messages to consume.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can use this method to remove failed, deleted tuples from the offset manager. When we do a poll, we examine the retriable tuples for each partition. For each partition where we received tuples, we compare the earliest received tuple to the retriable tuples for that partition. If the offset of a given retriable tuple is lower than the offset of the earliest received tuple, then the retriable tuple must have been deleted. </p>\n\n<p>About this issue:<br/>\nThe fact that failed tuples can be removed from Kafka before they can be retried is something I overlooked in what I wrote earlier. I think either solution can deal with it though.</p>\n\n<p>One correction to what I wrote earlier regarding emitTupleIfNotEmitted filtering btw: We'll should also pause partitions in this solution IMO. Otherwise it is possible (even likely if there are few retriable partitions) to allow poll due to retriable tuples, and get no retriable tuples from the poll, in which case we'll discard all the messages and try again later. I think it would make that solution unacceptably wasteful (we'd risk multiple useless polls for unrelated partitions every time we have to retry a tuple while at the maxUncommittedOffsets limit), so we should pause nonretriable partitions.</p>\n\n<p>The solutions I see to this issue right now are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Don't enforce maxUncommittedOffsets if there are retriable tuples at all. This is simple to implement, but I don't really have a good feeling for what the likelihood is that maxUncommittedOffsets will be exceeded by \"too much\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Example of this functionality:<br/>\nMaxUncommittedOffsets is 100<br/>\nMaxPollRecords is 10<br/>\nCommitted offset for partition 0 and 1 is 0.<br/>\nPartition 0 has emitted 0<br/>\nPartition 1 has emitted 0...95, 97, 99, 101, 103 (some offsets compacted away)<br/>\nPartition 1, message 97 is retriable<br/>\nThe spout seeks to message 97 and polls<br/>\nIt gets back offsets 99, 101, 103 and potentially 7 new tuples. Say the new tuples are in the range 104-110.<br/>\nIf any of 104-110 become retriable, the spout may emit another set of 9 (maxPollRecords - 1) tuples.<br/>\nThis can repeat for each newly emitted set. The likelihood of this happening in real life is unclear to me.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enforce maxUncommittedOffsets globally by always allowing poll if there are retriable tuples, pause any non-retriable partitions if the spout has passed the maxUncommittedOffsets limit, and filter out fresh tuples from the poll result. This should work to enforce maxUncommittedOffsets. In order to avoid dropping messages, the consumer has to seek back to the earliest offset on each partition that was filtered out by this new check. As far as I can tell we won't be increasing the number of discarded tuples by an unreasonable number as long as we pause non-retriable partitions. This is because the spout will currently discard any acked or already emitted offset it receives in a poll. This solution will additionally discard those that are entirely new, which means they have to have a higher offset than the newest currently emitted tuple on the retried partition. It seems (assuming tuple failures are evenly distributed in the emitte set) more likely to me that most retries will happen somewhere \"in the middle\" of the currently emitted tuples.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Example of this functionality:<br/>\nMaxUncommittedOffsets is 100<br/>\nMaxPollRecords is 10<br/>\nCommitted offset for partition 0 and 1 is 0.<br/>\nPartition 0 has emitted 0<br/>\nPartition 1 has emitted 0...95, 97, 99, 101, 103 (some offsets compacted away)<br/>\nPartition 1, message 99 is retriable<br/>\nWe pause partition 0, seek to offset 99 on partition 1 and poll.<br/>\nWe get back offsets 99, 101, 103 and potentially 7 new tuples. Say the lowest of these is at offset 104.<br/>\nWe prefilter the offset list to remove acked, emitted and new tuples, leaving 99. The 7 new tuples are filtered out.<br/>\nThe consumer seeks to offset 104 to pick up there on next poll.<br/>\nThe spout emits offset 99.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to highlight that the filtering solution only discards tuples when it gets new tuples back in a poll, so if the retriable tuple in the example had been e.g. 50, it would not have been unnecessarily discarding anything. </p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enforce maxUncommittedOffsets on a per partition basis (i.e. actual limit will be multiplied by the number of partitions) by always allowing poll for retriable tuples that are within maxUncommittedOffsets tuples of the committed offset. Pause any non-retriable partitions if the spout has passed the maxUncommittedOffsets limit. There is some additional bookkeeping in this solution, because we have to know for each partition whether the maxUncommittedOffsets limit has been reached, and if so what the offset of the tuple at the limit is (e.g. if the limit is 10, we want to know the offset of the 10th tuple emitted after the current committed offset). I believe we should be able to get that information out of the acked and emitted sets in OffsetManager.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Example of this functionality:<br/>\nMaxUncommittedOffsets is 100<br/>\nMaxPollRecords is 10<br/>\nCommitted offset for partition 0 and 1 is 0.<br/>\nPartition 0 has emitted 0<br/>\nPartition 1 has emitted 0...95, 97, 99, 101, 103 (some offsets compacted away)<br/>\nPartition 1, message 99 is retriable<br/>\nWe check that message 99 is within 100 emitted tuples of offset 0 (it is the 97th tuple after offset 0, so it is)<br/>\nWe pause partition 0, seek to offset 99 on partition 1 and poll<br/>\nWe get back offset 99, 101, 103 and potentially 7 new tuples. Say the lowest of these is at offset 104.<br/>\nThe spout emits offset 99, filters out 101 and 103 because they were already emitted, and emits the 7 new tuples.<br/>\nIf offset 104 (or later) become retriable, they are not retried until the committed offset moves. This is because offset 104 is the 101st tuple emitted after offset 0, so it isn't allowed to retry until the committed offset moves.</p>\n\n<p>I think either solution of the last two solutions should work, and we should be able to implement the fix for <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2546\" title=\"Kafka spout can stall / get stuck due to edge case with failing tuples\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2546\"><del>STORM-2546</del></a> on top of either.

My thoughts so far around potential solutions are mostly in-line with yours. I wanted but did not get around to confirming the behaviour of Kafka Broker / Group Coordinator when the client node that paused a partition crashes OR leaves group OR suffers network partition before calling resume() for that partition. We need to confirm the behaviour in this scenario and handle it accordingly in the spout.</p>\n\n<p>About Solution #3:<br/>\nI am assuming we need NOT pause partition 0 in solution #3 for the scenario described. This solution, to me, is basically extending the current logic around maxUncommittedOffsets to every partition in the spout. If a spout handles only one partition then we would never really pause it. We simply stop calling poll if a partition reaches maxUncommittedOffsets without any failed tuples. Otherwise the partition should continue to be polled. The logic should then simply take care of seeking to the appropriate offset depending on whether retriable tuples are present.</p>\n\n<p>Agree completely that the choice is between #2 and #3. Am leaning toward #3 for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>Partition is a fundamental building block / concept in Kafka and this solution fits neatly into it and extends it</li>\n\t<li>For Storm spout, Kafka Partitions enable scaling and isolation among other things. It is not acceptable for a 'healthy' partition to be blocked by an 'unhealthy' one</li>\n\t<li>We do a fair bit of partition-specific bookkeeping in OffsetManager already. More bookkeeping is a fair price to pay given the reward on offer.. <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/></li>\n</ul>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/307481098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2117#issuecomment-307481098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2117","id":307481098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzQ4MTA5OA==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-09T19:38:29Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T19:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srdo thought I sent and replied your earlier emails as well.

It just causes it to not fetch records for the paused partitions. The paused state is not preserved if the client crashes (because the local state is then lost), or if the consumers rebalance (see <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2af4dd8653dd6717cca1630a57b2835a2698a1bc/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/SubscriptionState.java#L49\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2af4dd8653dd6717cca1630a57b2835a2698a1bc/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/SubscriptionState.java#L49</a>). I don't think we need to worry about this. Also I'm pushing for us dropping support for Kafka-managed subscriptions here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2151\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2151</a> so I'm hoping this ends up being irrelevant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am assuming we need NOT pause partition 0 in solution #3 for the scenario described</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reason we want to pause is that when the spout is at (or past) the maxUncommittedOffsets limit, it should only emit retries or a very limited number of new tuples. In the example I gave above, if we don't pause partition 0, then the poll triggered to fetch offset 99 on partition 1 might just return a full batch of messages from partition 0. There is no guarantee that the poll will even contain the retriable tuple, so we might do this multiple times. If there were 10 additional partitions we might get full polls for any of those as well before we get the retriable tuple.</p>\n\n<p>If we don't pause we can't really enforce maxUncommittedOffsets as far as I can tell. </p>\n\n<p>I agree that if there's only one partition it should never be paused.

Each poll where we pause will reemit (or discard pending the fix for <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2546\" title=\"Kafka spout can stall / get stuck due to edge case with failing tuples\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2546\"><del>STORM-2546</del></a>) some retriable tuples. The only way the spout should be completely blocked due to retries is if the user hasn't configured a retry limit and the tuples fail consistently.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that it isn't ideal, but I don't see a way to have a limit like maxUncommittedOffsets be properly enforced without pausing (and thus blocking) the healthy partitions when we get in this state where maxUncommittedOffsets is violated.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612983691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6125#issuecomment-2612983691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6125","id":2612983691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODM2OTE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-09T21:20:47Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:56:50Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>Wait, I think this is fixable.

The current implementation errs on the side of caution by always reemitting if it can't positively say that a tuple has been acked. I'm not sure how we could do the same when the acker has to notify the spout to reemit after the timeout, because that message could be lost.</p>\n\n<p>It might be a good idea as you mention to instead have two timeouts, a short one for the acker and a much longer one for the spout. It would probably mean that messages where the acker init message is lost will take much longer to retry than messages that are lost elsewhere, but it might allow us to keep timeout resets out of the spout.</p>\n\n<p>Tuples can be lost if a worker died, but what if there's a network issue? Can't messages also be lost then? </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/307553590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2074#issuecomment-307553590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2074","id":307553590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzU1MzU5MA==","user":{"login":"kamleshbhatt","id":4641205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDEyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4641205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/kamleshbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamleshbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-10T09:22:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-10T09:22:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My Apology for the delay.
