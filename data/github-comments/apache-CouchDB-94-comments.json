I need your opinion here 😄 actually I discovered that it's not possible to run `--only` and exclude stuff, mainly because inclusion takes precedence over any exclusion, so even if we exclude some `pending` tests they are included again as part of a (example given) `kind: :single_node` test suite.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I found was adding a `@tag kind: :pending` to those modifying indeed the `kind` label of the test. This way pending tests were properly excluded.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is feasible? Pending tests are like less of ten, so I'd follow this approach and do some PRs following this trying to resolve those pending cases, just to get rid of this stuff.

The most obvious case is when querying a stale view. With this PR, that never works, because all txn's started on the http process will use the same grv, the one used to fetch security properties and check if the view is built. When the async process that updates that view (couch_view_jobs) completes, the http process can't query it because it won't fetch a new grv.
