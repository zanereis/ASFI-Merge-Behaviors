is part of code, `application.conf` should just for standalone running mode. We should never mix them, the `value` in `metadata.xml` just stands for `defaultValue` and should not be treated as configuration file. Currently we still have to manually do it. And for some application, it may have tens of configuration items like this app. \n\nBetter solution is make the `configuration` in `metadata.xml` be part of code as designed before like:\n\n```\nAppConfiguration{\n     @Property(name=\"eagle.app.configName\",displayName=\"ConfigName\", defaultValue=\"defaultValue\")\n     public String configName;\n}\n```\n\nIt should be good for:\n1. Provide metadata inline in typesafe way and avoid ugly get configuration by Config.getXXX method hidden in logic code.\n2.
