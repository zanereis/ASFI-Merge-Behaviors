`visualizations` , every chart file has  `transformProps.js` \r\nYou can find `chartProps` which contains `onAddFilter()` function already.\r\nThe function is `src/dashboard/actions/dashboardState.changeFilter()`\r\n\r\nTake `Sankey` as an example:\r\n`transformProps.js` \\:\r\n```\r\nexport default function transformProps(chartProps) {\r\n  const { ... onAddFilter } = chartProps;\r\n  const { ... groupby } = formData;\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    ...\r\n    onAddFilter,  // add. filter function\r\n    groupby,    // add. filter field\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`Sankey.js`\\:\r\n```\r\n// ... receive onAddFilter and groupby\r\nlet centered;  // add\r\nconst link = svg.append('g').selectAll('.link')\r\n    ......\r\n    .on('click', function (d) {    // add filter on link\r\n      if(d && centered !== d){\r\n        addFilter(groupby[0], d.source.name, false, false);  // d.source.name: filter value\r\n        addFilter(groupby[1],

false, true);\r\n        centered = null;\r\n      }\r\n      d3.event.stopPropagation();\r\n})\r\n```\r\nThis method may apply only to a part of the charts.And the way to get filtered fields/values is not the same.\r\nThe implementation of each chart is quite different.\r\n(e.g. click event of  Pie is `chart.pie.dispatch.on(\"elementClick\", function(e) {})`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/477454936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/477457635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5496#issuecomment-477457635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5496","id":477457635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzQ1NzYzNQ==","user":{"login":"mrw95","id":48785340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Nzg1MzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48785340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95","html_url":"https://github.com/mrw95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrw95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T05:47:44Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T05:47:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\"aggregations\":

As Further I need more functionalities like:  I have 4 charts in single page: 1 is pie chart,1 is bar graph, 1 is line chart and 1 other. If I click on an element of pie chart or bar graph ,other 3 charts on that page should rerender with the data related to that specific element that is selected. What is your opinion on this.

You're right. I was thinking of when I changed the colors and then went to the chart and explored it from the chart list. I have updated it to use the chart form data so that when you explore it, it will use the color scheme associated with that chart.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think there are differing opinions of what should happen. I personally am unsure and think we need to rethink about it from a broader perspective that covers all, or at least most, cases. It does feel more consistent to have what the dashboard set but we still have a problem if the chart is part of multiple dashboards that have different color schemes. Should the color scheme just be temporary? Should we indicate to the user that this is not the chart's saved color scheme? There hasn't been a general consensus yet. We can definitely discuss more for future PRs if you want to brainstorm a better experience. But for now, I will reset it to the chart's color scheme until there's been a clearer consensus of that experience should be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/477775744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/477780832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7032#issuecomment-477780832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7032","id":477780832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzc4MDgzMg==","user":{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T21:37:57Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T21:37:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xtinec can we merge this into `lyftga`?

As I indicated, it passes all the unit tests and works perfectly when I've used it myself.  \r\n\r\nThe remaining issue is that @mistercrunch prefers to have code that is specific to one database in the `db_engine_specs.py` file.

If someone can show me how I can fix that, I will gladly do so, but I'm really stuck at this point. \r\n\r\nAs I said, I do feel this PR is solid and ready to be merged.

Grace and I discussed offline. We are in agreement on how the ideal scenario should be. But I think that leads to the next point: we need color consistency in charts as well. I'd like to address these in separate PR's that build on top of each other where each PR gets us to a better experience (It's always nicer to review smaller PRs if we can help it. I know I appreciate that :) ). So I'd like to keep it how it is and open up a git issue that will address color consistency in charts that includes having consistency when you explore charts from the dashboard.
