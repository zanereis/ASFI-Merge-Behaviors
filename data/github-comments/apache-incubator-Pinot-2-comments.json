the min/max time in the two tables shows realtime is definitely newer\nthan offline, so my initial guess is incorrect.\nWould it be possible for you to:\n1. run the ShowClusterInfo command from pinot-admin.sh and provide the\noutput?\n2. Also, if the data is small, do you think you can send it across along\nwith your scripts for me to try?\n    Or else, just the scripts?\n\nThanks,\nMayank\n\nOn Sun, Sep 20, 2015 at 8:19 PM, izzizz

My guess is that this version of Kafka depends on scala-library 2.10.4 but we added larray recently, which depends on scala-library 2.10.3. Doing a `mvn dependency:tree` shows that the scala-library that's pulled isn't stable (sometimes it gets pulled through larray, sometimes it gets pulled through Kafka), so that's a more likely explanation. For example, the Hadoop part will contain scala-library 2.10.3 while pinot-server apparently contains 2.10.4.\n\nHowever, you can always run your local build with an arbitrary version of Kafka, by doing `mvn -Dkafka.version=0.8.2.2 -DskipTests install`. I wouldn't put this in master (the Kafka version change) without understanding what's causing this, but the routing table change is a good catch.\n\nCan you update the PR to only keep the routing table change?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/199028885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/199060012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/88#issuecomment-199060012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/88","id":199060012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTA2MDAxMg==","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-20T23:36:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-20T23:36:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
