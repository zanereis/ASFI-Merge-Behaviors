when you run a query against a SQLite database that has a time grain of week or month, you pass a `query_obj` something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        {\r\n            'groupby': [],\r\n            'metrics': ['sum__value'],\r\n            'granularity': 'received',\r\n            'from_dttm': datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1),\r\n            'to_dttm': datetime.datetime(2001, 12, 31),\r\n

date, but the `%d` is doubled up to `%%d` and consequently the `strftime` doesn't work, and so the date doesn't get truncated.\r\n\r\nThe SQL that gets generated by that `query_obj` is
