The two options are not the inverse as I thought, it's just the default that is different. So the current code does indeed work because of SSHHook's default. Which does beg the question if SSHHook's default is sensible. And also, whether SFTPHook should follow that default. I think the last one is very important, because the default behaviour of 1.10 is to fail when the host key validation failed, but I think the changes of #3945 would allow them to succeed in 2.0. So now I think SFTPHook should change the default value of `no_host_key_check` to `False` and just set it to `True` when `ignore_hostkey_validation == 'true'`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/433654069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/433654410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4091#issuecomment-433654410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4091","id":433654410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzY1NDQxMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-27T20:53:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T20:20:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#4091](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/e703d6beeb379ee88ef5e7df495e8a785666f8af?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `82.35%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #4091      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   76.67%   76.66%   -0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         199      199              \n  Lines       16186    16209      +23     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        12410    12427      +17     \n- Misses       3776     3782       +6\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/hooks/S3\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9TM19ob29rLnB5) | `93.03% <82.35%> (-1.29%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `77% <0%> (-0.31%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `92.09% <0%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/hooks/mysql\\_hook.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9ob29rcy9teXNxbF9ob29rLnB5) | `90.38% <0%> (+0.38%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4091?src=pr&el=footer).

The setting can be overridden using the deprecated `ignore_hostkey_validation` setting, or the `no_host_key_check` setting.
