Why doesn't the error occur for the many other action containers which are routinely  removed from the system?\n2. An external agent can overcome the problem but will complicate our container-only principle and make deployment potentially complicated.  The agent will itself need to be restarted and coordinated with the invoker as essentially part of the logic is being moved into another component.\n3. If we separate out blackbox containers, it is feasible to avoid logging through docker by having the action container push out its logs by some other means.  This is of course a lot more work but might give us much more control and splitting off blackbox means we are committed to multiple implementation strategies.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/221601483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/221602851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/494#issuecomment-221602851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/494","id":221602851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTYwMjg1MQ==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T14:56:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T14:56:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ioana-blue

However, the activation record from the invoker is written once and so it is still on the critical path anyhow.  That's the latency aspect but equally serious is the overall performance issue.   In various versions of docker, we have noted significant delay in other docker operations when `docker log` was in use (both latency and general slowness) and so moved away from it.  This is in relation to both `docker log` and `docker log --follow`.  Of course docker 1.11 might be better but we are not on that yet.\n\nAt a higher level, the point of this PR is to unify the way we get logs in the invoker.  Whether we do it from the filesystem or via the docker API, we should not be doing both as we are now.  So I think we should consolidate that first and in the future move (all at once) to possibly other logging mechanisms.  \n\nDaniel is investigating other potential remedies for the future including streaming it out or using an external nanny agent to recover logs.
