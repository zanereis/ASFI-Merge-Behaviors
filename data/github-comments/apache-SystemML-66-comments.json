Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work?

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.

As you, @mboehm7, commented in my thesis, the current state management is not working correctly for incremental updates that are based on stats and lattice from a run of incSliceLine that already depends on stats and lattice from an even earlier run. This is because the slices and stats that are pruned through incremental pruning methods are not stored for subsequent increments even though we mostly have all the necessary information. I updated the code to track the lost slices and stats and add them to the output lattice and statistics (L and Stats) lists as well. Also, currently, some tests run into errors when enabling the new approx pruning method, which is why for now I set the enabling boolean to FALSE.

Therefore, I kindly ask for guidance.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### 1. Original Implementation Intent\r\n\r\nI aimed to implement the **Federated Roll Function** as follows:\r\n\r\n1. **Coordinator Role**:\r\n   - Shift the `begindims` and `enddims` of the `fedworker` matrices stored in `fedmap` by a specified `shift` value.\r\n\r\n2. **Matrix Splitting Due to Shift**:\r\n   - If the `shift` causes a specific `fedworker` matrix to be split into two, dividing the entire matrix between the end and the beginning:\r\n     - **Existing Element**: Modify `fedrange` to point to the end of the entire matrix, keeping `feddata` the same (data from a non-split `fedworker`).\r\n     - **Add New Element**: Add a new entry with `fedrange` pointing to the beginning of the entire matrix, keeping `feddata` the same (data from a non-split `fedworker`).\r\n\r\n3. **Handling Split `fedworkers`**:\r\n   - Send an `EXEC_INST(rightindex)` `fedrequest` only to the `fedworkers` that are being split, to divide and store their `feddata`.\r\n\r\n### 2. Current Implementation Method\r\n\r\nDue to uncertainties in implementing step **(3)** as intended, I had to deviate and implement it as follows:\r\n\r\n3. **Sending `EXEC_UDP(SplitRow)` `fedrequest` to All `fedworkers`**:\r\n   - **Non-split `fedworkers`**: Set the existing matrix as `output`.\r\n   - **Split `fedworkers`**: Perform two `fedrequests`:\r\n     1.

Problems and Questions\r\n\r\n#### **Problem 1: Data Interference Issues in Split `fedworkers`**\r\n\r\n- **Situation**:\r\n  - Split `fedworkers` perform two `fedrequests` through a `fedmap` that points to the same `data` but with different `ranges`.\r\n  - The results are saved using `ec.setMatrixOutput(String.valueOf(_outputID), resBlock)`, resulting in only one of the execution results being stored.\r\n\r\n- **Question**:\r\n  - Is there a way to access the same `feddata` during `fedrequest` execution and save it as different `feddata`?\r\n\r\n#### **Problem 2: Avoiding `fedrequest` Communication with Non-split `fedworkers`**\r\n\r\n- **Situation**:\r\n  - Currently, results are aggregated using `MatrixObject out = ec.getMatrixObject(output);`, which requires communicating with non-split `fedworkers` to set their existing matrices as `output`.\r\n\r\n- **Question**:\r\n  - Is there a method to set the `input` as `output` within the coordinator without communicating with specific `fedworkers`?\r\n\r\n#### **Problem 3: Using `EXEC_UDP` Instead of `EXEC_INST`**\r\n\r\n- **Situation**:\r\n  - The federated `rightindex` slices the entire matrix rather than a specific `fedworker`'s matrix.\r\n  - Therefore, the current approach of splitting a specific `fedworker`'s matrix into two different `feddata` entries does not seem compatible.\r\n\r\n- **Questions**:\r\n  - Can federated `rightindex` be applied to the current situation?\r\n  - Are there potential issues or significant reductions in code reliability when using `EXEC_UDP`?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2380632190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2380635381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2116#issuecomment-2380635381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2116","id":2380635381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6N5Zz1","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-28T13:10:23Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T13:10:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM - thanks for the patch @fzoepffel.

Currently, only FED using CP INST works correctly, while FED using SP INST encounters errors.  The detailed implementation of `federatedRollFunction` discussed in the previous meeting is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. For non-partitioned `fedData`, the modified `range` and the same `varID` as the input are registered in `fedMap`.\r\n2. For partitioned `fedData`, `fedRange` is modified, and two `fedRequests` are called with two different `varIDs`.\r\n3. `fedRequest` calls `EXEC_INST` instead of `EXEC_UDF`, reusing the already implemented instructions. (Not implemented yet, future work)\r\n\r\n#### Question 1.\r\nAlthough step 2 was implemented, the result of `FederationUtils.getResults(ffr)` in the roll function differed from the final result checked by `readBlobFromFederated()` in the test. This is because, in the federated roll function, the `fedData` in `fedMap` uses different `varIDs`, but the `requestFederatedData` function used by `readBlobFromFederated()` requests `fedData` using the same single `_ID`. In most cases, `fedData` belonging to the `fedMap` uses the single `varID`, so it seems to have been implemented this way previously.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I modified the `requestFederatedData` function as follows to perform requests based on the `varID` of each `fedData`. Since this function is used in multiple places, I would like to ask if it’s okay to modify it this way. Additionally, if this modification is correct, should other functions like `forEachParallel` be modified similarly?\r\n```java\r\npublic List<Pair<FederatedRange, Future<FederatedResponse>>> requestFederatedData() {\r\n\t// FederatedRequest request = new FederatedRequest(RequestType.GET_VAR, _ID); // previous\r\n\tfor(Pair<FederatedRange, FederatedData> e : _fedMap)\r\n\t\tFederatedRequest request = new FederatedRequest(RequestType.GET_VAR, e.getValue().getVarID());\r\n\t\treadResponses.add(Pair.of(e.getKey(), e.getValue().executeFederatedOperation(request)));\r\n\treturn readResponses;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Question 2.\r\nThe current issue with FED using SP INST is that it fails to read `fedData` corresponding to step 1 in `readBlobFromFederated()`. However, if the `fedData` in step 1 is simply copied as output using a output `varID`, it is successfully read.\r\n\r\nSince both CP and SP proceed using the same `EXEC_UDF` in the `processInstruction()` function, it seems likely that there is a task outside of `processInstruction()` that requests the fedWorker to clean the input `varID` data. I would like to confirm if this assumption is correct, and whether there are any additional considerations specifically for SP.\r\n\r\nBelow are the `fedMap`, `readResponse`, and error messages that I checked with the debugger when running readBlobFromFederated().\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e25af786-97c6-4a11-b988-19049c8761a3)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2409139899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2423293456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2130#issuecomment-2423293456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2130","id":2423293456,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6QcIYQ","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-18T21:54:51Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T08:50:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/systemds/pull/2130?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `89.05109%` with `45 lines` in your changes missing coverage.

Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work? Only paid users can view reports and post statuses/comments.
