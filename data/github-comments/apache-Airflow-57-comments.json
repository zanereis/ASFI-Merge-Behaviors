This is a combination of 1 and 2 without the downside of 1 polling the filesystem for every request. Also if one of the webserver workers refreshes it will propagate to all other webserver workers, thus #1603 deals with the issue of outdated DAGs in the view (mismatch between the scheduler and webserver). \n\nI dont particularly like the constant polling approach that you are suggesting. This increases load on the system (atimes being updated on the fs, stats etc). In addition in increases the chances of a state mismatch between the scheduler and webserver (now suddenly the webserver can have newer definitions than the scheduler, who has what?) I do understand the \"parsing of complex dags\" issue, but I wonder if it is the right way of doing it. \n\nI would support a combination between #1603 and this. That would solve two issues from the user's perspective and reduce redundant polling and keep possible mismatches between the scheduler and webserver as low as possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/228587516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/228680069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1479#issuecomment-228680069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1479","id":228680069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODY4MDA2OQ==","user":{"login":"dsjl","id":18343854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQzODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18343854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl","html_url":"https://github.com/dsjl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsjl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T08:10:09Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T08:10:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin , thanks a lot for your useful comments that definitely helped improving the code quality.
