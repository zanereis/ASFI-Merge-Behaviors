the first problem is that it looks like you are trying to execute the subdag (`parent_dg.child_dag`) rather than the subdag task (`child_dag`) -- I think what you're trying to do is `airflow test

The reason is that airflow needs to be able to load all DAGs, including subdags, from the file in which they're defined.

Airflow ran only on schedules, and the primary key for a task instance was defined as dag_id, task_id and execution_date. When we added the notion of externally triggered DAGs (not on a schedule), we kept the PK as an artifact since changing that would require a significant refactor. \n\nWe did introduce the notion of run_id though that also has to be unique. (I believe there's a unique constraint on dag_id, run_id)\n\nAnyhow, changing that would require much more work than working around it. (What should the tree view look like for instance?) So I'd suggest running around it. \n\nRunning on schedule brings a lot of clarity to batch processing (though it's not always ideal or even possible). I'd consider having a job that run say every hour and batch processes all the files that have accumulated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/200040822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/200042142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1145#issuecomment-200042142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1145","id":200042142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDA0MjE0Mg==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T21:43:05Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T21:43:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/badge/334497/landscape.svg?style=flat)](https://landscape.io/diff/308277)\nRepository health decreased by 0.13% when pulling **[f93ac04](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/commit/f93ac0478c0c8bfbdc3f274322bdb0dd15829cf4) on dag_cli** into **[2015774](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/commit/2015774f93463afcc47c251e1a9b98e8fa8fd3f4) on master**.\n- [6 new problems were found](https://landscape.io/diff/308277) (including 0 errors and 4 code smells).\n- [7 problems were fixed](https://landscape.io/diff/308277/fixed) (including 0 errors and 1 code smell).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/200042142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/200059457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1168#issuecomment-200059457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1168","id":200059457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDA1OTQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T22:22:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T22:22:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmn.. @xiaoliangsc Sorry, can you paste your \"fixed\" code for completeness and for posterity.

@0xR \nWhat is your expectation here? \n\nRefer to https://pythonhosted.org/airflow/scheduler.html#scheduling-triggers\n\nSpecifically,\n\"Note that if you run a DAG on a schedule_interval of one day, the run stamped 2016-01-01 will be trigger soon after 2016-01-01T23:59. In other words, the job instance is started once the period it covers has ended.\"\n\nAn example cron schedule could be `0,15,30,45 * * * * *`, which means to run every 15 minutes.\nSo, \n- at `12:15:01`, the `12:00` run would start\n- at `12:30:01`, the `12:15` run would start\n- at `12:45:01`, the `12:30` run would start\n- at `13:00:01`, the `12:45` run would start\n\nNow, when you specified `0 0,5 * * *`, this worked as intended.\n\n```\n[2016-02-27 00:00:01,281] {local_executor.py:29} INFO - LocalWorker running airflow run my_dag start 2016-02-26T05:00:00 --local -sd DAGS_FOLDER/my_dag.py \n[2016-02-27 05:00:01,305] {local_executor.py:29} INFO - LocalWorker running airflow run my_dag start 2016-02-27T00:00:00 --local -sd DAGS_FOLDER/my_dag.py \n[2016-02-28 00:00:01,285] {local_executor.py:29} INFO - LocalWorker running airflow run my_dag start 2016-02-27T05:00:00 --local -sd DAGS_FOLDER/my_dag.py \n```\n\nAt `2016-02-27 00:00:01,281`, the period starting at `2016-02-26T05:00:00` was covered (or closed), meaning that `2016-02-26T05:00:00` could be scheduled.\n\nHope this makes sense. But, I'm closing this as NAB.
