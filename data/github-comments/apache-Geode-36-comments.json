This commit changes the behavior\r\nof ServerLauncher.start() so that it waits for all of the asynchronous\r\nstartup tasks to complete before returning the \"online\" status. The GFSH\r\n\"start server\" command relies on this status, so this also has the\r\neffect of making the command wait for all startup tasks to complete\r\nbefore returning.\r\n\r\n*

execute method returns a `ResultCollector`. `ResultCollector` does  have a timeout - there is `get(long, TimeUnit)` method. So naively, these new timeout parameters seem redundant.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `execute` method doesn't behave consistently when invoked on a peer vs. on a client. `execute` invoked on a peer doesn't block. It returns immediately, and the `ResultCollector` is how you wait for results. I think that's what you are seeing when you said your new parameters have no effect on `DistributedRegionFunctionExecutor`, etc.\r\n\r\nI have seen in the past that invoking execute on a client *does* block, so I can see why you want to add these parameters to that method. Of course that means that the parameters to `ResultCollector.get` make no sense on the client (with or without these changes).\r\n\r\nMaybe it would make more sense to make the `execute` on the client behave like it does when invoked on a peer - don't block, but return a result collector that can be used to wait for the results?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/520009514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/520362245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3903#issuecomment-520362245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3903","id":520362245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDM2MjI0NQ==","user":{"login":"mkevo","id":48509719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo","html_url":"https://github.com/mkevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T09:51:26Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T09:51:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @jinmeiliao, thank you for a help. \r\nI tested it, and it works great.

As a matter of fact, I found a ticket written by you a couple of years ago in which you already talked about this although it seems nobody has worked on it (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-3817).\r\nNevertheless, I currently see some problems with that approach:\r\n- The C++ and C# clients already provide a timeout parameter in the execute methods and they are also blocking so in order to be consistent we would also have to change these two clients.\r\n- In the Java client, as of today, when an execute call times out (because the execution takes longer than what is configured in the gemfire.CLIENT_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT property) after the configured retries have been reached, the connection is closed. We would lose this feature if we change the execute methods to be non-blocking.\r\n- The current DefaultResultCollector ignores the timeout passed in the get method. It would be needed to implement the timeout handling in this method as well as in any custom collector. This is actually not a problem, just a finding.\r\nAs I am quite new in the community, I do not know how to progress with this PR.

The name `geode-log4j` is meant to describe this as the `log4j-core` implementation of Geode Logging as opposed to the yet-to-be-created `geode-logback` which would be the logback implementation of Geode Logging. The idea is that if you want to use `log4j-core` with Geode then drop this jar in your classpath. The pom dependency says `implementation` instead of `api` only because these classes don't provide user APIs that return `log4j-core` classes. These classes simply install an SPI provider that enables Geode log-level, log-file, etc to interact with `log4j-core`. Without these provider classes, the logging properties and logging GFSH commands do nothing.\r\n\r\nThis module will export `org.apache.geode.logging.log4j`. `geode-core` will export `org.apache.geode.logging` and `org.apache.geode.logging.spi`.
