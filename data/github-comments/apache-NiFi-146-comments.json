Moving in the direction of `DateTimeFormatter` is a good thing, and it sounds like the performance improvements are also notable. There are some particular nuances when it comes to time zone handling, so it is important to have a good number of unit tests to ensure expected behavior regardless of the system default time zone.\r\n> \r\n> I noted several concerns and questions that would be helpful to address. Both @adenes and @turcsanyip have recent experience dealing date parsing issues, so it would be helpful to get additional feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks for review @exceptionfactory . I hope that I've fixed most places that you've pointed out. \r\n\r\nRegards to time zone I was trying to make as few changes in current expressions logic as it is possible and nifi expression language currently uses system time zone in some cases. By my comment \"some slight differences in interpreting time zone format\" I meant that e.g. if someone used `X` format, he/she may need to change it to `XXX` for input text like `+01:00` - it is because of changes of handling formats between `SimpleDateTime` and `DateTimeFormatterBuilder`. Using `.parseLenient().parseCaseInsensitive()` minimize number of those differences but not to zero.

Hope I can help!\r\n\r\n@auyer I think you'd need to download the source from my branch, [build it locally](https://github.com/apache/nifi#getting-started) and then copy the new NARs into your image in the `lib/` folder (overwrite the existing AWS NARs) - you can probably build just the AWS NARs (rather than the whole of NiFi) to speed up the process... if you build the whole of NiFi, you might as well just run the compiled version natively rather than using the Docker Image.\r\n\r\nSo, something like:\r\n```bash\r\n# clone the code\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ChrisSamo632/nifi.git\r\ngit checkout NIFI-2892\r\n\r\n# build the code\r\ncd nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-aws-bundle\r\nmvn -T 2.0C clean install\r\n\r\n# get the NARs\r\nfind . -name \"*.nar\" -exec {} /tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy these into a custom Docker Image with something like the following:\r\n```dockerfile\r\nFROM apache/nifi:1.13.0\r\n\r\nRUN rm lib/nifi-aws*.nar\r\n\r\nCOPY [ \"*.nar\", \"lib/\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run the custom image in the way you normally would.\r\n\r\nNote that I've not tested the above, so you may need to correct the instructions as you go - when developing NiFi, I just build from source and run natively, I've not got to the point of trying to copy the into a Docker container yet although that is how I run NiFi normally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/790017429/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/790849775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4863#issuecomment-790849775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4863","id":790849775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDg0OTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"sjyang18","id":41694933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjk0OTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41694933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18","html_url":"https://github.com/sjyang18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjyang18/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T18:57:09Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T18:57:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"let you know that there is a conflicting file.

I think this is close, but I would like to get some input from @turcsanyip as well since he has dealt with date parsing issues recently.\r\n\r\nThanks for update and another portion of good insights. I've refactored the code as you proposed and looking forward for input from @turcsanyip","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/794090810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/794211807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4872#issuecomment-794211807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4872","id":794211807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NDIxMTgwNw==","user":{"login":"diarworld","id":3768824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Njg4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3768824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld","html_url":"https://github.com/diarworld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diarworld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T17:37:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T17:37:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Little update: /subjects API works from 5.3.1+ version schema registry","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/794211807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/794214747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4877#issuecomment-794214747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4877","id":794214747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NDIxNDc0Nw==","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T17:39:59Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T17:39:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Verified by creating a flow with PutDatabaseRecord and restarting NiFi.

Just a thought.\r\n\r\nThanks for the testing and detailed feedback @thenatog!\r\n\r\nThere are certainly tradeoffs when it comes to to backwards compatibility, but running with an empty sensitive properties key is a serious security risk, so it is important to move in this direction.  Perhaps work could be done to make the encrypt-config.sh toolkit easier to use in this case, but that could be considered in a separate task if necessary.  It would be worth noting in migration guidance that using the toolkit is necessary.\r\n\r\nRegarding the default algorithm, we should move away from all of the existing PBE values.  NIFI-8246 addresses this issue explicitly and I am planning to submit a PR for that issue as soon as this PR is merged.  The internal default sensitive properties key does not meet the length requirements of the secure key derivation functions, but once this is merged, changing the default sensitive properties algorithm should be straightforward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/794608324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/794699179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4460#issuecomment-794699179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4460","id":794699179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NDY5OTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"jfrazee","id":47344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-10T01:20:42Z","updated_at":"2021-03-10T01:20:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MikeThomsen Thanks for this.
