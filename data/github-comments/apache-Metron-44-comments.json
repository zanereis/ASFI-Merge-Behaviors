The rest api is should handle empty values in a better way.  \r\nThough we can circumvent the empty values issue in groups by assuming all the missing records have an empty value for the selected group but the current search api doesn't support searching on empty value ie we cannot fire a search query that says 'give me all rows where host is empty'. Hence we will not be able to show the individual alerts under the group. This need to be handled in rest.\r\nDo you think this is a must-have for this PR or can we handle it in a follow-up PR ?.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/335466136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/335470839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/768#issuecomment-335470839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/768","id":335470839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTQ3MDgzOQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T13:23:40Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T13:23:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the thoughts and links @justinleet and @iraghumitra . \r\n\r\n> @iraghumitra: but the current search api doesn't support searching on empty value ie we cannot fire a search query that says 'give me all rows where host is empty'\r\n\r\nRight.

PLAN\r\n\r\n# Preliminaries\r\n\r\nSetup some environment variables for convenience:\r\n* `export METRON_HOME=/usr/metron/0.4.1` \r\n* `export ZOOKEEPER=node1:2181`\r\n* `export BROKERLIST=node1:6667`\r\n\r\n## Adjust the Profiler Period Duration\r\n\r\n* Adjust the profiler config by adjusting the \"Period Duration\" to 1\r\n  minute in Ambari Profiler config section. \r\n\r\n## Create data generator\r\n* Open `~/rand_gen.py` and paste the following:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\nimport random\r\nimport sys\r\nimport time\r\ndef main():\r\n  mu = float(sys.argv[1])\r\n  sigma = float(sys.argv[2])\r\n  freq_s = int(sys.argv[3])\r\n  while True:\r\n    out = '{ \"value\" : ' + str(random.gauss(mu, sigma)) + ' }'\r\n    print out\r\n    sys.stdout.flush()\r\n    time.sleep(freq_s)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n  main()\r\n```\r\nThis will generate random JSON maps with a numeric field called `value`\r\n\r\n## Create Parser\r\n\r\n* Create a new parser called `dummy` by editing `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"dummy\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Create the dummy kafka topic:\r\n  `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER --create --topic dummy --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n\r\n# Test Cases\r\n\r\n## Base Case\r\nFirst, let's ensure that data flows through with no enrichments or\r\nprofiler.\r\n* Push the configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER`\r\n* Start the parser via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -z $ZOOKEEPER -s dummy`\r\n* Send some synthetic data through (stop this after a few seconds):\r\n  `python ~/rand_gen.py 0 1 1 | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic dummy`\r\n* Validate data has been written to the index:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST

modifications show up.\r\n* Delete the dummy indices:\r\n  `curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/dummy*\"`\r\n* Modify `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json` like so:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n

been written to the index with the new fields, `parser_my_name` and `parser_value_abs`:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/dummy*/_search?pretty' -d '\r\n{\r\n  \"_source\" : [ \"source:type\", \"value\", \"parser_my_name\", \"parser_value_abs\" ]\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Modify Enrichment\r\n* Delete the dummy indices:\r\n  `curl -XDELETE

\"enr_my_name\", \"enr_value_abs\"]\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Modify Indexing\r\nWe'll change the name of the index now and make sure data is flowing\r\nthrough\r\n\r\n* Delete the dummy indices:\r\n  `curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/dummy*\"`\r\n* Modify `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/indexing/dummy.json` like so:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"hdfs\" : {\r\n    \"index\": \"smarty\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n    \"enabled\" : true\r\n  },\r\n  \"elasticsearch\" : {\r\n    \"index\": \"smarty\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n    \"enabled\" : true\r\n  },\r\n  \"solr\" : {\r\n    \"index\": \"yaf\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n    \"enabled\" : false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Push the configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER`\r\n* Send some synthetic data through (stop this after a few seconds):\r\n  `python ~/rand_gen.py 0 1 1 | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic dummy`\r\n* Validate data has been written to the new index name:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/smarty*/_search?pretty' -d '\r\n{\r\n  \"_source\" : [ \"source:type\", \"value\", \"parser_my_name\", \"parser_value_abs\", \"enr_my_name\", \"enr_value_abs\"]\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Modify Profiler\r\n\r\n* Modify

configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER`\r\n* Send some synthetic data through (let this go for some time in another window):\r\n  `python ~/rand_gen.py 0 1 1 | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic dummy`\r\n* Execute the following and ensure the number out is neither `null` nor `NaN`:\r\n```\r\nsleep 128 && echo \"STATS_MEAN(STATS_MERGE(PROFILE_GET('stat', 'global', PROFILE_WINDOW('from 5 minutes ago'))))\" | $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z node1:2181
