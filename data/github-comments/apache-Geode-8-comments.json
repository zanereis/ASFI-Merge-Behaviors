putting JMH benchmarks in the core - seems fine. I think I originally made geode-benchmarks a separate project so it would be easy to share code and compare benchmarks between modules - eg comparing lucene to OQL queries. But putting the benchmarks in each module maybe makes more sense.\r\n\r\nThis does seem to be somewhat stretching what JMH is designed for. JMH is targeted towards *microbenchmarks* so launching a separate server process seems a bit of a stretch. In particular, it's not clear to me here whether your server is getting restarted between benchmark iterations. JMH specifically tries to restart the JVM multiple times to deal with inconsistencies, but maybe only your client is getting restarted? In general I think we should probably be focusing on single VM, smaller unit benchmarks with JMH - benchmarking distributed systems might be better done with a different framework and multiple hosts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/295933623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/296271288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/472#issuecomment-296271288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/472","id":296271288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjI3MTI4OA==","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-21T18:43:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T18:43:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jhuynh1

Introducing a new xsd involves a bunch of busy work.\r\nYou need to add org.apache.geode.internal.cache.xmlcache.CacheXml.VERSION_1_2,\r\nupdate CacheXml.VERSION_LATEST,\r\nadd CacheXml.SCHEMA_1_2_LOCATION,\r\nadd CacheXmlVersion.GEODE_1_2,\r\nadd CacheXmlGeode12DUnitTest that extends CacheXmlGeode10DUnitTest.\r\nI'm not sure what should be done about these dunit tests. They test the old xsd/dtds which still do support mirror-type. If we remove support for the mirror-type attribute from the xml parser code then all these old dtds and xsds will no longer support  mirror-type in their xml even though the old dtd/xsd says it does. I think all the old dtds we still support also have data-policy so even with that old dtd you could convert the mirror-type attribute to data-policy in you existing xml.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/299925108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/299997432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/493#issuecomment-299997432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/493","id":299997432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTk5NzQzMg==","user":{"login":"davebarnes97","id":13138489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTM4NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13138489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97","html_url":"https://github.com/davebarnes97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-08T21:33:34Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T21:33:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Received
