@zentol,\n\nI had a look at your PR and the failing test case. The test was in place to ensure that objects are reused. For that the functions were implemented in a way that they will produce wrong results if objects are reused (therefore the unexpected result of 100 instead of 60). The problem was caused by the CollectionInputFormat which sends out different objects (instead of reusing the same object). When I changed that behavior and added some fixes to the ChainedAllReduceDriver, all tests pass.\nI will open a PR against your branch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/73913500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/73914381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/370#issuecomment-73914381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/370","id":73914381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTE0Mzgx","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-11T16:40:52Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T16:40:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, just saw that you updated your PR.\nWon't open a PR.
