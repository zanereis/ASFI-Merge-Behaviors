You need to modified several files. The central trick is about the `ReleaseAll` function in pooled_storage_manager. The hacking steps are as follows:\n1. move the ReleaseAll function to public\n2. write a correspoding `void RealeaseAll(int dev_id, int dev_type)` function in storage.cc. my code is \n\n```\nvoid StorageImpl::ReleaseAll(int dev_id, int dev_type) {\n    auto&& device = storage_managers_.at(dev_type);\n    storage::StorageManager *maneger = device.Get(\n            dev_id, []() {\n            LOG(FATAL) <<  \"Cannot Free space to a device you have not allocated\";\n            return nullptr;\n        });\nmaneger->ReleaseAll();\n}\n```\n\nyes, it is quite like the `Free` function, but `int dev_id, int dev_type` is easier to understand and it really frees memory rather than recycles memory.\n3. use `Storage::Get()->ReleaseAll(som_dev_id, some_dev_type)` to free memory.\nI have tested the code under some simple situations, like creating a NDArray an then deleting it. The code works. But when I wrote a python wrapper and used it in python ,it threw a memory exception. I didn't know why. As you see, this thread doesn't attract much attention of the core MXNet developers, so there might not be a perfect solution. Also, I think manually releasing the memory is not very safe in a very complex situation, so leting mxnet take the control maybe better. I suggest you the following way of getting rid of the memory problem.\n1. use python to write your mxnet code\n2. train the net using `commands.getstatusoutput('python your_model_file.py')`\nyou don't need to modified any source code and it also works.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237816791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237819839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2827#issuecomment-237819839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2827","id":237819839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzgxOTgzOQ==","user":{"login":"tornadomeet","id":5860892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjA4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5860892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet","html_url":"https://github.com/tornadomeet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T10:41:43Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T10:41:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/2927\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237819839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237830270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2934#issuecomment-237830270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2934","id":237830270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzgzMDI3MA==","user":{"login":"magic282","id":2285145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODUxNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2285145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282","html_url":"https://github.com/magic282","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magic282/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T11:44:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T04:50:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Godricly I tried the script.

have read through nccl code before, there are two factors\n- Allreduce reduction using ring based approach: this forms each device in a ring, and do ring based passing until the data get collected.\n  - The ring based approach kinda of partitions  the data in an array equally, so likely each peer in the ring have balanced work load.\n- Directly memory access to other GPU: When doing addition, no copy buffer is allocated, but memory is directly accessed from other GPU, this is possible when unified memory access is enabled.\n\n# Break it Down\n\n## Partition Strategy\n\nHow do we partition the workload in the parameters. \n- The most balanced way is to partition the array equally for big arrays(what we do now)\n- For conv weights, partition by parameters seems to be enough.\n  - Have advantage of concurrent scheduling(overlap copy with communication)\n  - Can be a bit imbalanced in workload for large arrays\n\n## Reduction Strategy\n\nThere are several strategies for all reduce, assume there is K devices, and N parameters to pass\n- All to all: copy all data to one device and aggregate, choose different reduction point per partition\n  - The communication is equally divided among the channels between peers\n- Ring based reduction, form a ring, and pass data around the ring.\n  - Communication is bottlenecked by the minimum peer to peer bandwidth between neighbors in the ring.\n    - i.e. if there is hierarchical PCI-e structure, this may not be optimal\n- Tree shape reduction\n  - Could be useful when the communication structure is like a tree\n\n## Direct Memory Access\n\nWith unified memory access, there is no need to allocate copy buffer, but kernels seems can directly access memory in another device instead\n\n# What we can do\n\nHere are the things we can do, besides adopting nccl. \n- Support direct memory access for reduction kernels in our case, this should eliminate the extra copy buffer, thus solves the memory problem\n- We can revisit the items here later, since nccl is still somewhat synchronized, my guess is async scheduling and some perf tuning on different communication strategy might still help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237893816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237894857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2939#issuecomment-237894857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2939","id":237894857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzg5NDg1Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T16:18:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T16:18:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes,

For example, (64,3,256,128) means a batch of 64 3-channel images (RGB) with spatial dimension of 256 height and 128 width. For fully connected layer, it only accepts (batch, length) data.\n\ngrad_req should be 'write' most of the time. If you set it as NULL the model will not learn.\n\nAbout your question, sorry about my previous reply and I did not find the actual solution. I suggest 1) use single input and then a mxnet.symbol.SliceChannel layer to cut it into two pieces. Alternatively, 2) use bind() rather than simple_bind().
