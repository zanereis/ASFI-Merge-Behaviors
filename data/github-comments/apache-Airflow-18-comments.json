had to make a call on where the first DAG run would be generated when migrating a DAG from 1.5 to 1.6. I didn't want to go all the way to the `min(start_date)` of the DAG for many reasons. So for DAGs with task instance history and no DAG run (thus migrating), we decided to go 5 runs back from the latest recorded task_instance, assuming that the scheduler would re-evaluate the past 5 runs, complete them and keep moving.\n\nThe transition created a few problems in a few of our 130+ DAGs at Airbnb, but it was simply a matter of altering the state of a few DAG runs and adapting to the new way of doing things, notably increasing the `concurrency` setting on some large DAGs.\n\nNote that `start_date` is a task level param, and DagRun is a DAG level state. There are some race conditions there. There has always been some race conditions: say if you start a new DAG where task A depends on B and B's start_date is after A's, things would never have run in 1.5.\n\nBut yes, there are a few things to iron out here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/156918774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157016421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/628#issuecomment-157016421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/628","id":157016421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzAxNjQyMQ==","user":{"login":"real-impact-analytics","id":15818900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODE4OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15818900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics","html_url":"https://github.com/real-impact-analytics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/real-impact-analytics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T12:44:10Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T12:44:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch, I rebased and squashed this PR this morning and discovered another sqlite related-regression, which I think confirms the need of this PR since its purpose is precisely to try to catch them before a merge to master. \n\nThe bug is related to a date formated as string in a SQL statement, which is problematic in sqlite (failed build log: https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/airflow/jobs/91355755) and not in mysql (successful build log: https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/airflow/jobs/91355750). \n\nIt is also visible on the current master by simply running: \n\n```\n./run_unit_tests.sh tests.core:WebUiTests.test_dag_views\n```\n\nMy second commit above is fixing that. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157016421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157060174","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/596#issuecomment-157060174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/596","id":157060174,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzA2MDE3NA==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T15:02:32Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T15:04:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cwong99 can you post your code? `xcom_pull()` gets the most recent matching XCom, so if you are getting one from the current execution it sounds like you are calling `xcom_push` _before_ `xcom_pull` (because that would push the current value as the most recent one).

I think this is the library we should use. Because of the very diverse nature of AWS services, I highly recommend we create a hook per underlying service to avoid confusion about where data might be sent or were work might be done. I could create a BaseBoto3Hook that imports the boto3 package and sets up some of the authentication and you could build the container service hook on top. How does that sound?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157462568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157491777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/650#issuecomment-157491777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/650","id":157491777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQ5MTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T20:11:44Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T20:11:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Nice!\nFYI @askeys \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157491777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157491881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/651#issuecomment-157491881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/651","id":157491881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQ5MTg4MQ==","user":{"login":"askeys","id":2008048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2008048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys","html_url":"https://github.com/askeys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/askeys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T20:12:06Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T20:12:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157491881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/157499739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/648#issuecomment-157499739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/648","id":157499739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQ5OTczOQ==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-17T20:39:52Z","updated_at":"2015-11-17T20:39:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Haha, I'm in doubt thinking about it. Facts & thoughts:\n- CDH/HDP are not really tested against yet. To make it useful we need a mini hive cluster. Hopefully I have something coming month. CDH and HDP both have different Hive versions and CDH seems to back port fixes a bit more.\n- Sqlite is not used / should not be used in production, but comes in handy for development. Sqlite did suffer from regressions and so hampers development if it doesn't work\n- Postgres is first class citizen in the os world and even enterprise world is picking it up\n- Python 2.7 is mainstream, but python 3 demand is picking up quickly. I expect future major releases of linux distributions to start using python 3 as a standard soon.\n\nSo for now it doesn't really matter if we disable CDH/HDP at all. For backend testing it looks nicer to me to test within the same env, but as was mentioned in the other thread having it completely separated has also benefits.\n\nSo does this answer your question?
