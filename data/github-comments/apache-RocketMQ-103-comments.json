@dugenkui03 I found another issue. In the AsyncAppenderRequest, the max message size is 128000. So If the byte size of the accumulated TraceContext is more than 128000, it cannot reduce the RPC to improve the performance, but cause delay.\r\n> \r\n> So the algorithm may need to consider the byte size too. If the byte size is enough, it should be scheduled immediately.\r\n> \r\n> BTW, the data topic generated by \"sendTraceData\" is not used in \"sendTraceDataByMQ\".\r\n> \r\n> Maybe we need to clarify the design of topic mechanism for trace.\r\n\r\n@dongeforever Thanks for you suggestion. I trace the code and find we need do more to speed up  performance( such as reduce the total number of send trace message).  And the only benefit of this pr is that make the timing of submiting AsyncAppenderRequest more clearly, and it's is hard to say it's really improve the perfromance.\r\n\r\n# Describe in Chinese\r\n感谢建议和提醒，按照你的提示我跟踪代码后发现提交的任务`AsyncAppenderRequest`中的数据并非一次发送给服务端、还会按照topic+regionId分组且每组数据按照maxMsgSize分批发送。\r\n\r\n当前的任务`AsyncAppenderRequest`上报逻辑和数据按照topic+regionId分组逻辑对数据上报似乎没有太大帮助、因为数据最终发送的topic是由`AsyncTraceDispatcher#accessChannel`决定的。\r\n\r\n该pr可以使任务`AsyncAppenderRequest`提交的时机更明确，但是要切实优化性能需要进行多的修改。如下给出当前数据发送算法分析和优化思路\r\n##  当前逻辑\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1156\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18216266/163427423-99836b88-8ada-46a1-8981-bd90fbe14d2e.png\">\r\n\r\n1. 业务线程调用`AsyncTraceDispatcher#append`向任务元数据队列`traceContextQueue`添加`TraceContext`；\r\n2.  `worker`线程循环从`traceContextQueue`中获取`TraceContext`、并包装为任务`AsyncAppenderRequest`，由线程池`traceExecutor`执行；\r\n3. `AsyncAppenderRequest#sendTraceData`中将`TraceContext`转换为可计量大小的`TraceTransferBean`，并按照按照**topic+regionId**对`TraceTransferBean`进行分组、获取结构为`Map<String, List<TraceTransferBean>>`的数据；\r\n4. 将`TraceTransferBean`按照`maxMsgSize`进行分批次的发送，根据`AsyncTraceDispatcher#accessChannel`决定发送到`rmq_sys_TRACE_DATA_${regionId}`还是轨迹消息队列(默认为`RMQ_SYS_TRACE_TOPIC`) 。\r\n\r\n当前逻辑的问题是`worker`通过`AsyncAppenderRequest`对数据进行了不必要的分割`List<TraceTransferBean>`，在`AsyncAppenderRequest#sendTraceData`中对数据也进行了不必要的分组。\r\n\r\n## 优化思路\r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18216266/163450807-6aa00276-b544-4768-9f64-ba23bfcfcdd0.png\">\r\n\r\n1. `work`线程将数据按照topic分组、保存到`HashMap<String, TraceDataSegment>`中，`TraceDataSegment`中保存了TraceTransferBean列表、数据大小和当前列表第一个TraceTransferBean的保存时间；\r\n2. 将数据保存到`TraceDataSegment`中时会判断TraceTransferBean列表是否已经达到 maxMsgSize，是则发送数据、并恢复`TraceDataSegment`的初始值；\r\n3. `work`线程每`pollingTimeMil`毫秒会遍历所有的`TraceDataSegment`，检查其数据保存超过是否`waitTimeThresholdMil`毫秒，是则发送所有数据、以此避免时间保存过久不发送。\r\n\r\n该算法的总体思路是在数据达到大小阈值`maxMsgSize`或者时间阈值时发送数据。可避免之前因为数据不恰当的分组导致过多的请求。代码初步实现见#4180。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1099351837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1099555920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4166#issuecomment-1099555920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4166","id":1099555920,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85BieRQ","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-14T19:32:15Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T19:32:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

构造函数对于列表使用保护性拷贝。\r\n\r\n这些建议的目的均为使得对象安全的创建或者发布，避免可以获取到对象引用或者对象集合字段引用的不可信代码、不恰当的使用导致对象状态被破坏。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1106017550/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1106050929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3914#issuecomment-1106050929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3914","id":1106050929,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85B7P9x","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T06:19:22Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T06:19:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1106050929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1106056505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4194#issuecomment-1106056505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4194","id":1106056505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85B7RU5","user":{"login":"pingww","id":2748647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDg2NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2748647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww","html_url":"https://github.com/pingww","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pingww/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T06:27:49Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T06:27:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When
