There is plausibly a good reason for the old `release` profile name, but there are really two things happening:\r\n\r\n1. Actually building things like source jars and javadoc for the release. Hence the name `release`.\r\n2. Disabling the default run of tasks and validation that are not on the critical developer path (hence putting `checkstyle`, etc. in a profile). Hence the name `all-checks`. However it's not just slow *checks*, it's also slow *tasks* -- like building source jars, shading, javadoc.\r\n\r\nThe problem is we really want to run the same set of tasks both places. Specifically, precommit should check that the release process isn't broken. And the release process should verify that all our validations are still met.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not certain which name is better, or whether we should have two profiles. But `all-checks` seems better for the day to day.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270702397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270705327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1740#issuecomment-270705327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1740","id":270705327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDcwNTMyNw==","user":{"login":"bjchambers","id":35960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers","html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T17:33:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T17:33:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I guess my concern is that if we all want to run with `all-checks` normally, maybe that should be the default?

I've wanted to change the name `-P release` to something better for a while, but didn't want to deal with rocking the boat. You are right that the main things it is intended to skip are the incredibly slow jar and javadoc processes. It isn't really about checks at all, though it seems to have become so, despite its name...\r\n\r\nI agree with @dhalperi that running all tasks/checks all the time is wrong for regular devs. I now also think it is wrong for new/rare contributors, which is a change of mind for me. \r\n\r\n - regular devs know how things work and can readily use various invocations as long as they aren't multi-line monstrosities\r\n - the precommit should basically match the release (modulo postcommit slow stuff)\r\n - new contributors by definition don't know how things work, so I want to open a line of communication with them as early as possible, before all checks\r\n\r\nI think that Maven actually has a distinction that we are not taking advantage of - `mvn test` versus `mvn verify`. The latter include packaging while the former does not. I've forgotten - is there a reason we don't use this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270726295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270727459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1735#issuecomment-270727459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1735","id":270727459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDcyNzQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T19:00:02Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T19:00:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/6429/<h2>Failed Tests: <span class='status-failure'>1</span></h2><h3><a name='beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/org.apache.beam:beam-examples-java' /><a href='https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/6429/org.apache.beam$beam-examples-java/testReport'>beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/org.apache.beam:beam-examples-java</a>: <span class='status-failure'>1</span></h3><ul><li><a href='https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/6429/org.apache.beam$beam-examples-java/testReport/org.apache.beam.examples/WordCountIT/testE2EWordCount/'><strong>org.apache.beam.examples.WordCountIT.testE2EWordCount</strong></a></li></ul>\n--none--","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270727459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270737255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1604#issuecomment-270737255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1604","id":270737255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDczNzI1NQ==","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T19:39:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T19:39:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@robertwb comment updated.
