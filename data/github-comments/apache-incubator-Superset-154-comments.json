There are several problems with the role based permission models.\r\n1. if you have datasource access of a bunch of tables named Perm_A, it allows you to view dashboard A if its datasource is a subset of Perm_A's datasource. The tricky thing is that if by coincident, dashboard B 's datasource also a subset of Perm_A, then it will cause problem if dashboard B is not supposed to be accessed by anyone.\r\n\r\n2. Datasource access is only controlled over table. Why datasource access control is not available on the level of database, schema or catalog? If you want to control a department's datasource access, you have to list all of the tables that belongs to the specific department. That's unreasonable. If a company has hundreds of departments and thousands of databases, it will require many superset administrator to manage the permission.\r\n\r\n3. The permission models does not support deny. In some use case, if you don't have one permission, you will be denied.\r\n\r\nI did some hack things to avoid the complex permission management. I use scripts to automatically add one invisible slice to dashboard. Each slice use different datasource(data sources are auto create by script as well!). Then it can solve problem 1. \r\nScripts will be scheduled once an hour to collect all the dashboard's table permissions and create a grouped roles. The final things for admins to do is add the grouped role to specific user. That saved a lot of work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/402068569/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/402069571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3932#issuecomment-402069571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3932","id":402069571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjA2OTU3MQ==","user":{"login":"yamyamyuo","id":8351385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTEzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8351385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo","html_url":"https://github.com/yamyamyuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T09:14:44Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T09:14:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"see #538","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/402069571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/402070838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3085#issuecomment-402070838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3085","id":402070838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjA3MDgzOA==","user":{"login":"yamyamyuo","id":8351385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTEzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8351385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo","html_url":"https://github.com/yamyamyuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yamyamyuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T09:17:48Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T09:17:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do you have plans to do datasource access control on catalog / schema level? @mistercrunch \r\nIt is highly useful when controlling permissions.

First the <img> approach requires auth + perms, which may not work on mobile when Superset is on intranet, and no vpn is setup on the phone. It has the advantage of being more secure in many ways, though it may just not work in many envs (mobile is not on VPN). Forwarding an email would only work for the recipient if she/he has access to the chart for instance.\r\n\r\nThe binary approach has a lot of advantages too, it will just work.\r\n\r\nMaybe we need both? Maybe environments would define which method they allow? Maybe the schedule would allow you to pick which method to use in that particular case?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/402574099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/402574997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5294#issuecomment-402574997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5294","id":402574997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjU3NDk5Nw==","user":{"login":"mahendra","id":115988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra","html_url":"https://github.com/mahendra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-05T00:16:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T00:16:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch I did consider the idea of URLs for the image and embedding it within mails. However, I decided against it for the following reasons\r\n\r\n1. Generating the image (using a webdriver) was an expensive operation (CPU/Memory). I thought it would be better to generate it once in the background and send it off to multiple recipients in one shot. We could cache the URLs and reduce the hit on the servers.\r\n2. As you noted - VPN limitations. We have such a setup, but we have a large mobile sales team which will appreciate full delivery of the data for quick reference. (mobile device VPN is a pain)\r\n3. We also plan to send out mails to external entities, who will not have access to our mobile setup.\r\n\r\nI however do like the embedded URL approach to prevent accidental forwards of internal reports to external folks :-)\r\n\r\nI agree on having a both approaches. The current approach is easy to extend.\r\n* The celery jobs generate the images and store/cache them (for a period of time)\r\n* The emails contain the links or blobs (based on a config)\r\n* If someone hits the URL and the image does not exist / has expired, we fire off a celery job and generate it.\r\n\r\nI can work on this in a future ticket (this issue -
