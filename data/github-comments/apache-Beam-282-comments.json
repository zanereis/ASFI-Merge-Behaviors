I’ll try to describe this in short.\r\n\r\nKinesis stream consists of shards which are the base throughput units. Each shard has a capacity of 1MB/s input and 2MB/s output data. So in order to adjust the required throughput you can control the number of shards the stream has. Data records are segregated and routed to shards based on the partition key specified while putting data into the stream. Partition key is hashed and compared with the range of possible hash key values for the shard.\r\n\r\nIn order to adjust the number of shards in the stream, you have to split or merge already existing shards. Split operation closes the chosen shard and creates two new shards that together cover the same range of hash keys (you can choose the hash key at splitting point). Merging operation closes two specified adjacent shards and creates a new shard that covers the same hash keys range.\r\n\r\nEach shard has following properties:\r\n- id\r\n- id of it’s parent (or 2 parents if shard is a result of merging 2 other shards)\r\n- HashKeyRange - the range of possible hash key values for the shard.\r\n- SequenceNumberRange - the range of possible sequence numbers for the shard. Shards that are in the OPEN state have an ending sequence number of null.\r\n\r\nSo in practice there are 2 situations that need special handling in Kinesis connector. One is at the very beginning, when the connector has to find it’s starting point in Kinesis stream. User can specify starting position by using special descriptors like LATEST, TRIM_HORIZON or by supplying a starting Instant. All these cases are handled by [StartingPointShardsFinder](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4243/files#diff-f0f164c7ef72631fe4a2c6204c1857c7) class. This class goes over stream shards chronologically and validates them by getting iterator at given starting point and trying to read records. If shard does not pass the validation then it is considered expired and we look for it’s successors. Finally, all valid shards are gathered and used as initial shards.\r\n\r\nThe second situation that required special handling is the case when reading (in [ShardRecordsIterator](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4243/files#diff-2575f9e5887ad41e39377fe305272a4b) class) reached the shard’s end. The [GetRecords](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_GetRecords.html#API_GetRecords_ResponseSyntax) operation will return null value for NextShardIterator property then. This means that we need to stop reading this shard and pick up it’s successor(s). This is handled in [ShardReadersPool](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4243/files#diff-cb143c1e7f7647878be39b74eaf85a4c) class in a catch clause where KinesisShardClosedException was caught. Firstly we wait until all records read from expired shards are taken from internal queue. Then in readFromSuccessiveShards method we find shard’s successors and replace old shardIterator with the new one(s). In case of merge operation, two shards have one successor so only one of them will be replaced with it.\r\n\r\nIt’s not a comprehensive description so please let me know if anything is not clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/353570418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/353589227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4317#issuecomment-353589227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4317","id":353589227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzU4OTIyNw==","user":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T12:29:33Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T12:29:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jasonkuster @chamikaramj I noticed that currently FileBasedIOIT disrupts results of `JDBC Dataflow Benchmark` in BigQuery table .
