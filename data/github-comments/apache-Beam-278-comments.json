I probably am missing something, but here's my $0.02:\r\n\r\nThe class is part of `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-util-java` which is a dependency of `runners-core-construction-java` where the reference is made, but the shading of the direct runner relocates `com.google.protobuf.**` without bundling that artifact. It bundles the core protobuf artifact, which will not contain everything that is needed. So my reading is that the config is just wrong.\r\n\r\nEditorial: I used to be annoyed that it was hard to distribute `x.y` separately from `x.y.z` in Python but that practice in java is a positive nightmare.
