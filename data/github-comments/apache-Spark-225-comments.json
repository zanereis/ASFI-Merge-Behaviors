Callers have to share that state then somehow. Hashing is easier, and 64 bits makes it work for practical purposes. \n\nA caller has to do something like these to deal with real-world identifiers because an `Int` ID API by itself doesn't quite work. This is an instance of a meta-concern I have, if an API which (from my perspective) is going to be problematic at scale is already unchangeable before battle-testing. (I actually thought all of MLlib was de facto `@Experimental`?)\n\nYeah however you can layer on other APIs to fix it, or use `@deprecated` in cases like this to keep existing methods but add new signatures too. I think that would be the simplest solution to this particular concern.\n\nThe question of serialized size is still out there. That is worth weighing in on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49013972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49020152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1155#issuecomment-49020152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1155","id":49020152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDIwMTUy","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-15T11:38:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-15T11:38:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1155:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds the following public classes (experimental):<br>class MulticlassMetrics(predictionAndLabels: RDD[(Double, Double)]) {<br>\\* (equals to precision for multiclass classifier<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/16671/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49020152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49023679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1413#issuecomment-49023679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1413","id":49023679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDIzNjc5","user":{"login":"willb","id":1161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb","html_url":"https://github.com/willb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-15T12:23:02Z","updated_at":"2014-07-15T12:23:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aarondav @pwendell Yes, with this patch I'm able to enable the YourKit features that were causing crashes before.
