like @HeartSaVioR said it depends on the versions you are upgrading between.  Most of the time we have maintained wire and binary compatibility so you can do the upgrade piecemeal. This should work between versions of storm that have the same major version number.  1.0.0 to 1.1.0, or 1.1.0 to 1.1.2, but not 0.10.x to 1.0.0.\n\nThe procedure that we follow when doing an upgrade is to\n\n1) shutdown and upgrade nimbus (we are not currently running HA, but if we were step 1.b would be to upgrade the other nimbus instances one at a time)\n2) pick a single node that is not upgraded yet.\n2.b) install the new version of storm on the node.\n2.c) shoot all the storm processes, supervisor, logviewer, and workers\n2.d) clear out all of the state on the node (NOT needed every time, but we are cautious because of bugs in the past)\n2.e) relaunch the supervisor and logviewer.\n3) repeat until all of the nodes are done.\n\nFor our large clusters we actually do a few nodes at a time, not one. This procedure does have a few issues.  Primarily the biggest issue is churn in the worker processes.  We try to avoid doing the upgrade a lot because it is not truly transparent to all topologies.  They recover, but they have had every one of their worker processes shot at least one, and possibly multiple times.  This can cause data issues in non-trident topologies, and can slow down the processing in trident.\n\nI would recommend that you do it a little differently, and this is what we want to move to.\n\nfor each node in parallel as much as possible install the new version of storm then shoot the supervisor and the logviewer.  Wait for them to all come back up, or at least enough that you feel good about it.\n\nThen again as parallel as possible shoot all of the worker processes on all of the nodes.\n\nThis still has the disadvantage of having all of the worker processes being shot and slowing things down, but they are guaranteed to only be shot once, and the recovery time should be much faster.

This should work between versions of storm that have the same major version number.  1.0.0 to 1.1.0, or 1.1.0 to 1.1.2, but not 0.10.x to 1.0.0.</p>\n\n<p>    The procedure that we follow when doing an upgrade is to</p>\n\n<p>    1) shutdown and upgrade nimbus (we are not currently running HA, but if we were step 1.b would be to upgrade the other nimbus instances one at a time)<br/>\n    2) pick a single node that is not upgraded yet.<br/>\n    2.b) install the new version of storm on the node.<br/>\n    2.c) shoot all the storm processes, supervisor, logviewer, and workers<br/>\n    2.d) clear out all of the state on the node (NOT needed every time, but we are cautious because of bugs in the past)<br/>\n    2.e) relaunch the supervisor and logviewer.<br/>\n    3) repeat until all of the nodes are done.</p>\n\n<p>    For our large clusters we actually do a few nodes at a time, not one. This procedure does have a few issues.  Primarily the biggest issue is churn in the worker processes.  We try to avoid doing the upgrade a lot because it is not truly transparent to all topologies.  They recover, but they have had every one of their worker processes shot at least one, and possibly multiple times.  This can cause data issues in non-trident topologies, and can slow down the processing in trident.</p>\n\n<p>    I would recommend that you do it a little differently, and this is what we want to move to.</p>\n\n<p>    for each node in parallel as much as possible install the new version of storm then shoot the supervisor and the logviewer.  Wait for them to all come back up, or at least enough that you feel good about it.</p>\n\n<p>    Then again as parallel as possible shoot all of the worker processes on all of the nodes.</p>\n\n<p>    This still has the disadvantage of having all of the worker processes being shot and slowing things down, but they are guaranteed to only be shot once, and the recovery time should be much faster.  The supervisor relaunches them quickly instead of possibly having nimbus time them out and reschedule them on a node that has not been upgraded yet.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/233334394","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1574#issuecomment-233334394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1574","id":233334394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzMzNDM5NA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T13:52:20Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T13:52:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code to do the leader election based off of the IDs was removed because architecturally the blobstore should be in charge of maintaining high availability.

Min replication count was not set but the cluster was run in HA mode and something bad happened, and then HA did not recover cleanly.  This issue is that without with min replication count HA does not really work properly.  It would be nice to have a way to make this simpler for end users so they don't have something else to configure.  But the reality is that a lot of this feels like user errors and errors in documentation, not blockers for the software.

The reality is if I use HDFS as the backing for the blobstore and I only set it to have a single replica, then I lose a datanode, nimbus will still crash in almost exactly the same way.  Is this a bug in nimbus?  Is it a bug in the blobstore or HDFS? I would say no. It is user error because the user is trying to make something HA without configuring it properly. Then when an error happens we cannot recover.  So the question is, if it does happen is it better for nimbus to crash or is it better for nimbus to hang?  Because all this does is it switches from one to the other.  I can see advantages for hanging over crashing, so I am OK with this fix.</p>\n\n<p>    Does the blobstore code have bugs in it and things that we can change to make it work better? I would expect it to, it is software after all.  I just want us to spend some time thinking about how we really want it to behave and fix it properly.  If that proper fix comes after making a few patches to improve things, that is fine.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612927927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/233377643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1572#issuecomment-233377643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1572","id":233377643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzM3NzY0Mw==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T16:14:17Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T16:14:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 @HeartSaVioR why can't we enforce the min.replication.count by looking nimbus.seeds if there are more than one host in that list we should set the min.replication.count to 2.

This should not be a problem, especially if you stick with official releases.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612899905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5565#issuecomment-2612899905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5565","id":2612899905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4OTk5MDU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-19T13:31:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:14:57Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kabhwan\">kabhwan</a>:</i>\n<p>This is merged to master and 1.x-branch, but not 1.0.x-branch.</p>\n\n<p>We should port back to 1.0.x-branch but I'm not sure what lowest version this will be included since we're in progress of release vote 1.0.2 RC3.

This is not a part of storm, it appears to be a part of ranger, so my guess would be that you need to include ranger, or part of it on your classpath.  You could do this by putting it in the lib directory under the storm.home directory. You might also want to try asking on the ranger or storm user mailing lists, because honestly I don't use ranger.  At this point it does not look like a bug in storm, it looks like user error or an issue with your configuration, so I am going to close this JIRA.
