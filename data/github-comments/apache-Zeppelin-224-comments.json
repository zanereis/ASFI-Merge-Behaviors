Let me try to provide an example to better explain myself:\r\nwhen using zeppelin in multi-tenant environment with spark on hadoop cluster. one user can set their own dependencies and driver configurations via inline configuration or interpreter setting page and everything works as expected\r\non the other hand, when setting dependencies or driver configs in k8s, these are ignored and only chance is to set them via `SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS` as you mentioned, BUT\r\n\r\n- this will be fixed for every user and sometimes users would like to have different set of dependencies and driver configurations\r\n- as stated in zeppelin docs `To be noticed, SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS is deprecated and will be removed in future release.`\r\n- in my opinion with this fix we can provide users with the same experience with spark running in k8s as running in hadoop cluster or stand alone mode\r\n\r\n\r\n> Your configuration values like `spark.driver.extraClassPath` and `spark.driver.extraLibraryPath` should take no effect, because Zeppelin starts Spark on Kubernetes always in client mode.\r\n\r\nYes, it is running in client mode, but driver is not yet started so there is a possibility to pass them to the driver on start so they can have effect. We are doing the same in [SparkInterpreterLauncher](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/c4c580a37fde649553d336984a94bcb1b2821201/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/launcher/SparkInterpreterLauncher.java#L80)\r\n\r\n> You can also set `SPARK_DRIVER_EXTRAJAVAOPTIONS_CONF` directly in your Spark Zeppelin interpreter configuration if you want to override the (possibly empty) default setting.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I was not aware of that. I know we can set few [params with env vars](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/934e38add26157b87d6b247e4efca4f795411a2c/spark/interpreter/src/main/resources/interpreter-setting.json#L227) but I can't find how to set env var from interpreter configuration\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1180703056/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1181276498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4405#issuecomment-1181276498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4405","id":1181276498,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5GaNlS","user":{"login":"SIOUkoeran","id":35398494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzk4NDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35398494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran","html_url":"https://github.com/SIOUkoeran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SIOUkoeran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-12T03:35:58Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T03:36:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thank you for doing it.

LGTM but is it fine to remove some tests? We encourage adding tests so I recommend keeping tests if it's available. WDYT?\r\n\r\nYes, I agree with you.

Since the \"hello world\" case passed, if other case does not work well, it may be a bug of Alluxio not Zeppelin. In fact, at this time, I only import alluxio-shell as dependencies so it similar to above case. However, it is inevitable that dependencies will be imported and conflict may happened. So, the better way is to add all the Alluxio Cli test cases in Alluxio interpreter test case so that we are able to catch the conflict at the first time. However, it is a big project and need lots of works. As a compromise, I choose the only basic and daily used command test  to keep in the test cases.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1188512777/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1188531385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4398#issuecomment-1188531385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4398","id":1188531385,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5G14y5","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T02:39:26Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T02:39:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zlosim [SparkInterpreterLauncher](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/c4c580a37fde649553d336984a94bcb1b2821201/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/launcher/SparkInterpreterLauncher.java#L80) supports all the spark configurations.

Right now setting e.g. [spark dependencies via zeppelin interpreter settings](https://i.imgur.com/VeSvIFa.png) is not working in K8s because we are trying to set it in runtime which is too late as driver is already started. This PR picks settings from interpreter settings passed by user that have to be passed directly to spark submit command when creating k8s pod with driver and puts them in env var so interpreter.sh script will start driver correctly.
