The problem is: In several parts of Pinot there are try-catch sections that catch Exception and do something (logging, returning something special, etc). Usually it is a bad practice in Java to catch Throwable because most of the times the application can not survive to an Error. For example, if we are getting out of memory or if there is an assertion that fail. \r\n\r\nBut that usual good practice does not always apply. For example I found that by not catching OOM errors in the ingestion jobs we are in fact not failing when one of them is thrown and therefore we break the consistency. In this PR I found a similar problem: As our code is not catching the AssertionError that assert throws, the integration tests were neither failing appropriately neither logging the problem. Instead I've got a very random error and no logging, which makes it very difficult to understand where the problem was.\r\n\r\nWe have two options here: Either modify our codebase to try to catch all the Throwables in the root of the threads or do not use assertions. What we cannot do is to continue using assert when it is more problematic than useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198909909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198911033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8979#issuecomment-1198911033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8979","id":1198911033,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Hde45","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T06:02:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T06:02:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> For descending order, ideally we should implement an iterator which can read rows in reverse order\r\n\r\nThat was my first approach and for sure it would be better. But the cursor interface specifies that iteration must be done in ascending order. I tried to add a new reverse cursor that doesn't do that, but I wasn't sure about its implications. If there is some out code there that assumes all cursor iterations are going to be ascending, we may have problems. Therefore I prefer to initially add an implementation that is more conservative.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198911033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198975964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9093#issuecomment-1198975964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9093","id":1198975964,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Hduvc","user":{"login":"ddcprg","id":7541790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDE3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7541790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg","html_url":"https://github.com/ddcprg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddcprg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T07:39:49Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T07:39:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"nice! thanks for reviewing and merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198975964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1198981591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9132#issuecomment-1198981591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9132","id":1198981591,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5HdwHX","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T07:46:54Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T07:48:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9132?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#9132](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/9132?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (393ef29) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/396f37daec153eb584094fbaa9450010323d8933?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (396f37d) will **decrease** coverage by `5.11%`.\n> The diff coverage is `60.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #9132      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     68.71%   63.60%   -5.12%     \n+ Complexity     4740     4734       -6     \n============================================\n  Files          1838     1791      -47     \n  Lines         97436    95357    -2079     \n  Branches      14699    14467     -232     \n============================================\n- Hits          66958    60652    -6306     \n- Misses        25757    30326    +4569     \n+ Partials       4721     4379     -342     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `66.98% <60.00%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `15.32% <0.00%> (-0.04%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
