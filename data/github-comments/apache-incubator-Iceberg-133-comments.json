adding the ability to use a lock doesn't need to require a dependency on iceberg-aws. The lock manager was built as an API and multiple implementations, including an in-memory implementation. The interface and in-memory implementation could be moved into core and you would then dynamically load your preferred lock manager. That avoids the circular dependency and adds very similar functionality to what you're doing here out of the box.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use case, I understand wanting to have no dependency other than the object store. I think the right way to do that is to coordinate writers, whether those are threads or processes. If you choose to go with the in-memory lock manager and risk data loss that's up to you -- to your point, you would have reached parity so you may not want full locking.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987282389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987290780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3675#issuecomment-987290780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3675","id":987290780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8462Nyc","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-06T22:18:38Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T22:18:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @ajantha-bhat!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987290780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987308704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3627#issuecomment-987308704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3627","id":987308704,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8462SKg","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-06T22:34:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T22:34:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @pvary!

As more and more integration come in,  the engine runtime modules will be  even more fatter. The correct way is making them to be pluggable modules,  for example the apache hadoop release don't include all the cloud vendor's object storage   implementations into the default classpath,  but it makes those modules to be hadoop's plugin implementations and if people want to enable the specific vendor implementation then they just enable it.\r\n\r\nFor our apache iceberg integration case, I think we can also make the `iceberg-aliyun` to be optional plugin modules and we build `iceberg-aliyun` module with including all dependencies jars. If people want to access the iceberg tables backed aliyun oss, then they just need to load the `iceberg-aliyun` jar. Does that make sense (also for future vendor integration ) ?

But it's really a trade off. User's don't necessarily have to opt-in either.\r\n\r\n1. It can save a large amount of money for jobs that need a very large amount of memory to keep their entire state in memory.\r\n2. Mostly I've found, at least with Flink, that once the core set of parameters were tuned for our common use cases, we could apply those everywhere and get away with that being \"good enough\".\r\n3. Tuning very large JVMs, with the amount of memory needed to store equivalent amount of data that can be stored for much less on disk with RocksDB is its own challenge. There's simply no truly escaping a certain level of complexity at a certain scale.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, RocksDB is arguably the most common state backend for Flink. Now, as of Spark 3.2, there's a RocksDB state store for structured streaming contributed by databricks.\r\n\r\nGiven these two things, I don't think that the additional settings available is a huge issue.\r\n\r\nI think the Flink project has done a lot of work in minimizing the necessary tuning for RocksDB. With time, similar things could be introduced here. But even making this a possibility will be a really large win for very large jobs which might have a large amount of state or need to otherwise spill to disk.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987528140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987535452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3669#issuecomment-987535452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3669","id":987535452,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8463Jhc","user":{"login":"felixYyu","id":3785228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3785228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu","html_url":"https://github.com/felixYyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixYyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-07T03:28:50Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T03:28:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I use hadoop catalog，so hive catalog shoudn‘t be finded。the hadoop table  can't load table by path?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987535452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987535952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2680#issuecomment-987535952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2680","id":987535952,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8463JpQ","user":{"login":"kien-truong","id":149578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong","html_url":"https://github.com/kien-truong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kien-truong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-07T03:30:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T03:30:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I agree with you that having RocksDB is a win, our stateful Flink jobs all use Rocksdb backend :)\r\n\r\nBut I think we need to more clearly communicated the trade-off to the user.

A shot summary of the approach used there was that:\r\n1. use 1MB as a threshold, if the total size of the vendor's runtime module is less than 1MB, just include it\r\n2. otherwise, we can include the iceberg integration code, but the vendor dependency is marked as provided and not bundled in the runtime jar.\r\n\r\nBut I think what @openinx suggests also works, and it's a clean user experience.\r\n\r\nThe reason we did not do that for the AWS module was that people usually have their preferred AWS SDK version that is used across their environment and upgraded together, so we don't want people to be bundled to an exact AWS SDK version that we offer. For example, AWS EMR maintains its own AWS SDK version and it's already in the java classpath, so user actually don't need to specify all those additional AWS SDK dependencies anyway, specifying it would potentially cause issue because of 2 SDK versions coexist.

But we're just maybe not their yet is all I mean. Having the ability to spill to disk is a lot of work - which @openinx and others have been doing a great job with. But even look at the age of this PR - it's moving along, but it's definitely a process.\r\n\r\nIt's good to be aware of how the need to pass configurations will affect the rest of the codebase, as Ryan had mentioned was one of the bigger areas for concern. Ideally we can pass configs to rocksdb without too much disruption to the rest of the codebase.\r\n\r\nOnce that has crossed it's goal, we can worry more about user experience when using RocksDB. And I'll happily drop most anything I'm doing to review most documentation PRs!\r\n\r\nAnd when the time comes, if you want to write a blogpost about using RocksDB, I'd happily review any drafts or be sure it's prominently displayed on the Apache Flink website 🙂\r\n\r\nFor now, let's focus on getting RocksDB or similar available to developers within Iceberg and then we can definitely focus on the user experience. It is definitely true that there are many situations where it makes less sense than remaining in-memory, but having the option sure is nice.\r\n\r\nBut it's good to be thinking about end user experience always. It's definitely one of my biggest concerns with all things too. So many thanks for that. 😀","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987542250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987545455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2680#issuecomment-987545455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2680","id":987545455,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8463L9v","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-07T03:56:57Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T03:56:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I agree with you that having RocksDB is a win, our stateful Flink jobs all use Rocksdb backend :)\r\n> \r\n> But I think we need to more clearly communicated the trade-off to the user.

I wonder what would be the performance of this versus in memory vectorized read + compaction. If the later is good enough, we can probably avoid introducing this complication.\r\n\r\nDiscussion came back up, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBesides other perceived possible benefits from RocksDB (which admittedly might not be reason enough to introduce the added complexity for some use cases), the motivating use case is really the potentially much larger than typical memory usage required to process the initial table snapshot for CDC, which is a common use case. To take a snapshot or begin a CDC stream from MySQL for example, a full table copy is required before the initial checkpoint can be taken iiuc. So this historically has lead users to have to majorly increase their initial memory / resource allocation and then tune down after the job had successfully checkpointed.\r\n\r\nI'll follow up with openinx and steven about the status of this feature and state of the problem in general.\r\n\r\nWithout that issue, I'd lean towards keeping as few elements in state as possible to avoid having to worry about further serrialized forms. But I think the issue is still outstanding, as a full snapshot is needed before any deltas can be written iiuc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987585529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987609838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3681#issuecomment-987609838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3681","id":987609838,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8463bru","user":{"login":"hameizi","id":18445460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDQ1NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18445460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi","html_url":"https://github.com/hameizi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-07T06:24:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T06:24:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx @stevenzwu can you help take a look?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987609838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/987621490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3680#issuecomment-987621490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3680","id":987621490,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8463ehy","user":{"login":"wuwenchi","id":19755729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU1NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19755729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi","html_url":"https://github.com/wuwenchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuwenchi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-07T06:49:47Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T06:49:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kbendick  Sorry for the problem with the PR format ...

In our Aliyun EMR,  we don't put all of the aliyun sdk into a common path and make all the components refer it, instead we guarantee all the upper components are using the same aliyun sdk version and packaging them into their specific components classpath.  Although those components are packaging the same versioned aliyun sdk and introduce the duplicated sdk jars, but they are using the same version, so in theory we can use anyone of them.\r\n\r\nAnother difference from aliyun sdk is:  we aliyun don't publish the bundled aliyun sdk to aliyun users, so people have to choose their needed aliyun sdk jars and package them into a bundled jar by themself (if necessary).  I think most of the other vendors choose this approach.

@rdblue  the changes look good to me. I am curious about the interest in this approach over eg #3580? It seems to me that we have written a lot of boilerplate code here for a builder that could be removed w/ Immutables or equivalent. Additionally the hand-coded json parsers could also be removed. [This link](https://github.com/rymurr/nessie/blob/store-metadata/model/src/main/java/org/projectnessie/model/IcebergTableMetadata.java#L56) shows a prototype I've been working on (please ignore the differences from the spec its a WIP). It illustrates the builder and the json serialization though I have removed some of the validations for the purpose of the PoC. Immutables has rich [support for validations](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#precondition-check-method) though.\r\n\r\nWould it be helpful to start a mailing list discussion about this pattern?

This standardizes the set of changes to `TableMetadata` and uses a builder pattern to make consistent, high level changes. For example, `setCurrentSchema` will add a schema, rebuild partition specs and sort orders, then set the current schema. And every update is tracked in a list of changes since the version last written to disk. That's quite different from a builder that assumes you're doing to supply each part of the metadata separately.\r\n\r\nMaybe immutables can be used for this purpose?

In fact we are deploying apache iceberg to maven repo for two kinds of people: \r\n\r\n1. The first are developers,  they just choose to dependency a light-weight module to develop their own applications,  so we should make the dependency as light-weight as possible.\r\n2. The second are iceberg users.  They need a whole bundled jar to make the iceberg access work. As we know, we don't plan to add the integration jar whose size is greater than 1MB, then how to handle those integration work.

@CircArgs for this change, which improves the current implementation using some powerful python features. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the open question about the possible extra performance cost, another concern I have is the impact on other classes. As this change is a fundamental one, it ​will bring some changes to other classes depending on it, e.g. the transform will then be implemented in a similar way using generic_class defined in types (based on [the PR](https://github.com/jun-he/incubator-iceberg/pull/4)). \r\n\r\nFor example, ```Truncate[Decimal[9, 2], 10](12.34)``` will create an iceberg Decimal class instance. This will add extra cost to process the data. In the current way, we create a Truncate instance, which will be re-used to apply a transform function to a python value and then return it in python directly. So there is no iceberg type instances in the middle.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the iceberg literals are types are separated. literals are mainly used for data, e.g. used expressions, and types are mainly used in metadata, e.g. transform, partition spec. This way enables us to improve the performance or shortcut the transformation when it is needed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/989120897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/989308118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3104#issuecomment-989308118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3104","id":989308118,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84696TW","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T23:23:16Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T23:23:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have updated this PR based on the TableMetadata builder refactoring. it is quite hard to separate the update logic out of this, so I just included the changes in #3612 and marked @hameizi as coauthor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/989308118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/989337663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3601#issuecomment-989337663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3601","id":989337663,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX846-Bg_","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-09T00:27:44Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T00:27:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Suggesting a path forward here: @CircArgs would you be ok with converting this to a draft and breaking it up into a series of smaller PR's?
