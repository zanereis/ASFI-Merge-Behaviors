to put different types of resources to each worker slot, then push the resources within assignment to ZooKeepers; also, at the supervisor side, such resources in each worker slot should be used by supervisor for launching a worker's JVM (initially, the JVM heap size, this can also be called by CGroup or Docker for resource segregation).<br/>\n    Such scheme can be used not only by RAS scheduler (<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-893\" title=\"Resource Aware Scheduling\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-893\"><del>STORM-893</del></a>), but also by any
