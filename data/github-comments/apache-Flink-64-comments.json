I have some comments for this pull request.\n1. This pull request cannot pass checking Scala code style. The Scala code should not exceed 100 characters in each line. I also found some wrong indentations such as line 200-211 in `KNN.scala` file. Please reformat your code.\n2. The meaning of `BruteOrQuad` is ambiguous. From my understand, if `BruteOrQuad` is true, we use quadtree implementation, right? So the other name such as `useQuadTree` would be better.\n3. Please remove blank line after Scala doc comments.\n4. Your implementation assumes that the type of given `Vector` is `DenseVector`. But basically, there is no guarantee of the type of `Vector`. We should generalize the implementation.\n5. We should be able to configure the use of quadtree implementation. Please add configure parameter into `KNN` object.\n6. Currently, `predictDataSet` is too big and complex because of large code in `mapPartition` operation. How about split the operation into `mapPartition` for raw and quadtree?\n7. Please avoid calculation of `BigDecimal`. Maybe we can check whether we use quadtree or not without `BigDecimal` like following:\n   - `(4 ^ dim) * Ntest * log(Ntrain) < Ntest * Ntrain` is same as `dim + log_4(log(Ntrain)) < log_4(Ntrain)`\n\nThis is great start! If you have some question about my comments, please feel free to reply.\n\nP.S.: How about create training quadtree before cross operation? Is there any intention to create quadtree after cross operation?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145353515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145364401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1220#issuecomment-145364401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1220","id":145364401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTM2NDQwMQ==","user":{"login":"danielblazevski","id":10012612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10012612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski","html_url":"https://github.com/danielblazevski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielblazevski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-04T16:31:57Z","updated_at":"2015-10-04T16:31:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @chiwanpark for the very useful comments.  I have made changes to the comments, which can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/danielblazevski/flink/tree/FLINK-1745/flink-staging/flink-ml/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/ml/nn\n\nI also changed the testing of KNN + QuadTree, which can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/danielblazevski/flink/tree/FLINK-1745/flink-staging/flink-ml/src/test/scala/org/apache/flink/ml/nn\n\nSince useQuadTree is now a parameter, I did not need KNNQuadTreeSuite anymore and I removed it.\n\nI did not address comment 6 yet.  I need to have the training set before I can define a non-user specified useQuadTree, so any main if(useQuadTree) should come within `val crossed = trainingSet.cross(inputSplit).mapPartition {`\n\nAbout your last \"P.S\" comment,  Creating the quadtree after the cross operation is likely more efficient -- each CPU/Node will form their own quadtree, which is what is suggested for the R-tree here:\nhttps://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/mrknnj.pdf\n\nThis will result less communication overhead than creating a more global quadtree, if that is what you were referring to.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145364401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145364699","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1221#issuecomment-145364699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1221","id":145364699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTM2NDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"rerngvit","id":815664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTY2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit","html_url":"https://github.com/rerngvit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rerngvit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-04T16:37:31Z","updated_at":"2015-10-04T16:37:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The
