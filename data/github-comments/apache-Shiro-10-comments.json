After modification, a circular dependency error occurs: `ShiroFilterFactoryBean` --_create_--> `AbstractShiroFilter` --_implements_--> `Filter`,  `ShiroFilterFactoryBean` --_depends_-->

removed **filterFactoryBean.setFilters(filterMap)**(line:71) in `org.apache.shiro.spring.web.config.AbstractShiroWebFilterConfiguration`, because `ShiroFilterFactoryBean` will automatically inject

use of the **ShiroFilterFactoryBean#setFilter** method, which may cause errors in the user's stock code, and you need your help in evaluating the impact and solutions.\r\nActually in my opinion, in `Spring`, the _setFilters(Map<String, Filter>)_ method should not be provided.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1023241886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1031908030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/316#issuecomment-1031908030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/316","id":1031908030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s49gaq-","user":{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T20:51:05Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T20:51:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xczs666
