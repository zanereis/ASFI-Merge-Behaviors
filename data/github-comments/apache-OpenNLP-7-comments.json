Os vestígios humanos modernos mais antigos conhecidos são de homens de Cro-Magnon com \\\"traços\\\" de Neanderthal, com 24 500 anos e que são interpretados como indicadores de extensas populações mestiças entre as duas espécies. São também os vestígios mais recentes de seres com caraterísticas de Neandertal que se conhece, provavelmente os últimos da sua espécie[28] Há cerca de 5500 a.C., surge uma cultura mesolítica.[29] Durante o Neolítico a região foi ocupada por pré-celtas e celtas, dando origem a povos como os galaicos, lusitanos e cinetes, e visitada por fenícios[30] e cartagineses. Os romanos incorporaram-na no seu Império como Lusitânia [31] (centro e sul de Portugal), após vencida a resistência onde se destacou Viriato.[29]\\n\"\r\n      + \"\\n\"\r\n      + \"No século III, foi criada a Galécia, a norte do Douro, a partir da Tarraconense, abrangendo o norte de Portugal. A romanização marcou a cultura, em especial a língua latina, que foi a base do desenvolvimento da língua portuguesa.[32]\\n\"\r\n      + \"\\n\"\r\n      + \"Com o enfraquecimento do império romano, a partir de 409, o território é ocupado por povos germânicos como vândalos na Bética, alanos que fixaram-se na Lusitânia e suevos na Galécia. Em 415 os visigodos entram na Península, a pedido dos romanos, para expulsar os invasores. Vândalos e alanos deslocam-se para o norte de África. Os suevos e visigodos fundam os primeiros reinos cristãos. Em 711 o território é conquistado pelos mouros que aí estabeleceram o Al-Andalus. Os cristãos recolhem-se para norte, acantonados no Reino das Astúrias.

Fundamentally, array involves only comparison while HashSet involves hash calculation, generic overheads and comparison.\r\n* What's the average eos character count across languages?\r\n* What's the distribution of eos character counts across languages?\r\n* For how many languages the boundary mentioned in the first question is crossed?\r\n* What's the frequency of each eos character in the target language?\r\n* What the distribution of eos characters in target language?\r\n* If the eos character count justifies the switch to HashSet (see first question), then does the form of eos character distribution still backs up the switch? Power law distributions might be common in language and the fat head of such distributions might still make array lookups faster than HashSet.\r\n* Which language is processed by OpenNLP the most? or rather:\r\n* What's the distribution of languages across OpenNLP users? \r\n* Based on the answers to the above, which change at what level would be the most beneficial for most our users? Would the change at language level be better than globally for all languages? For example, there is a `opennlp.tools.sentdetect.lang.th.SentenceContextGenerator` which sets its own eosCharacters. Just as well there could be a Portuguese version of sentence scanner which uses HashMap for lookups. By the way, there is a duplication of eosCharacters constant in Thai `SentenceContextGenerator` and an override of a deprecated method.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/426953820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/427652860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/329#issuecomment-427652860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/329","id":427652860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzY1Mjg2MA==","user":{"login":"autayeu","id":495207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu","html_url":"https://github.com/autayeu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-07T13:18:09Z","updated_at":"2018-10-07T13:18:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Any thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/427652860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/comments/429445785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/329#issuecomment-429445785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/329","id":429445785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTQ0NTc4NQ==","user":{"login":"autayeu","id":495207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu","html_url":"https://github.com/autayeu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autayeu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T19:59:56Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T19:59:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Guys, any thoughts?\r\n\r\nIf the testing is applicable, for the majority of languages the change in this PR has made the code slower.
