- I see that I missed a bunch of discussion back in PHOENIX-6486, but I'm not yet convinced that having an equivalent to GJChronology / BritishCutoverChronology is the right design. \r\n\r\nIt looks like some other databases, such as MySQL, just use the Gregorian calendar for all time and require users to make adjustments. (See https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-calendar.html). \r\n\r\nThis pushes potentially annoying conversions on our users, but I think the user is the only one who can actually do this correctly. That's because the exact calendar in use on a particular date is going to be use-case and culturally-specific -- there's no one right answer. \r\n\r\nGJChronology is going to be \"right\" for areas that were part of the Spanish Empire and a few other countries in 1582 and wrong for everyone else.

agree with you @gjacoby126, but let me provide some context:\r\n\r\nIn my experience the Chronology issue has less to with real historical use cases than with being able to handle synthetic \"minus infinity\" constants like '01-01-01' or '1000-01-01' consistently.\r\n\r\nThe reason we stuck with GJChornology at the last change was because that's what Phoenix has effectively been using already, based on the default behaviour of java.util.Calendar, and this was the easiest way to be consistent on the read and write paths (and date functions) and between Joda and j.u.Calendar, which is still extensively used in Phoenix code.\r\n\r\nGJ is also the only Chronology that works without surprises with naive java Date code, i.e. when you do \r\n\r\n```\r\n// assume we're in UTC\r\nj.u.t.Date d = new j.u.d(1000,1,1,1,1,1);\r\n// write d to Phoenix with a PreparedStatement\r\n// read d back\r\nassertEquals(\"1000-01-01 01:01:01\", rs.getString(\"d\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is only going to succeed with GJChronology (or similar, like BritishCutoverChronology).\r\n\r\nConsequently, as long as Phoenix uses j.u.Date / Calender with the default Chronology, it is the only Calendar that can guarantee internal consistency in Phoenix.\r\nThe above is also true for views on HBase tables where custom timestamps are naively generated.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, GJChronology is the default chronology for j.u.Calendar/Date, while ISOChronology is the default for Joda and java.time, and we need to handle this discrepancy somehow.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, using a cutover chronology is both against the

@stoty , I hadn't realized that the Java 7 (and before) GregorianCalendar had an internal cutover similar to GJChronology. \r\n\r\nSo for me then the question is what version is this PR targetted for? If this is for 5.2, I can see it making sense for a short-term change that keeps the old behavior but removes the need for joda. (But would there be any problem to keeping joda for the 5.2 cycle and replacing it in 5.3 as part of a more comprehensive rework? If the answer is yes, that's fine, it's just a pretty big patch if a lot of this is temporary.) \r\n\r\nIf this is for 5.3, it makes sense to do the larger work to get the date and time logic to what you suggest -- no j.u.Date / Calendar, switching to ISOChronology with the ability for users to configure an alternative. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1266085546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1270413774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1506#issuecomment-1270413774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1506","id":1270413774,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5LuPnO","user":{"login":"tkhurana","id":679072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTA3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana","html_url":"https://github.com/tkhurana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkhurana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T17:00:54Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T17:00:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@palashc What kind of metrics do we have around the metadata cache ?

The previous implementation used ReadWriteLock to protect its cache operation (see PSynchronizedMetaData) as the underlying map used for the table cache was not thread safe and also it required multiple steps to update the table cache. Since we replaced the table cache with a tread safe cache (i.e., Guava), reduced the number of steps in a table cache operation to a single step, and also replaced the underlying maps for Schemas and Functions with ConcurrentHapMap, we removed PSynchronizedMetaData. @palashc, as far as I know there is no concurrency issue left to address. It will be good to check again to make sure we are good.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1270473150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1270812459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1506#issuecomment-1270812459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1506","id":1270812459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5Lvw8r","user":{"login":"palashc","id":6994740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTQ3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6994740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc","html_url":"https://github.com/palashc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palashc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T23:00:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T23:00:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @palashc What kind of metrics do we have around the metadata cache ?

Your email used thread local variable for somewhat global access, i worry if our execution engine becomes more multi threaded you will have to copy this to all the threads and become more and more cumbersome.  I'm hesitant of such patterns for things that are not semaphore like.  I assume the resistance in the code is from our lack of structure and not wanting to pass a parameter everywhere.  I think another approach is possible with a provider pattern given the connection and some jvm level singleton map.

approach?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1313278023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1314106560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1524#issuecomment-1314106560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1524","id":1314106560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs5OU6zA","user":{"login":"horvathdora","id":47719724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzE5NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47719724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora","html_url":"https://github.com/horvathdora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horvathdora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T17:15:26Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T17:15:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stoty
