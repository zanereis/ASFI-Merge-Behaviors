Since that issue is outside of this PR, I don't think a workaround should be committed in this PR.  I'll have a PR up for the `TestJdbcCommon` timezone issues on August 1st/2nd.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to remove the changes for the Travis build from this PR as well, so that the PR isn't held up by Travis failures.  I have another branch in which I was working on getting the build to pass on Travis with Java 11, but there are some issues with the time it takes to complete the build. The caching on Travis isn't working as I'd expect, and all the dependencies need to be downloaded for each Java 11 build.  If I remove the Travis changes from this PR, Travis would continue to build master with Java 8 only.  I'd submit a follow-on PR for the Java 11 build on Travis.  \r\n\r\n> Need to update the Dockerfiles to use Java 11 base images, but other than that +1.\r\n\r\nI'd like to keep the docker builds set to use Java 8 since the convenience binaries released are built with Java 8, until the minimum version of Java for NiFi is moved to Java 11.  There are also some components that are not able to be built on Java 11 (ActiveMQ, Ignite, Hadoop), so I think we should hold off on making that change in our Docker modules.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have specific issues with either of the above comments?\r\n\r\n@alopresto, if you are a +1 on the SSL-related changes, then it looks like the PR is in a good spot to be merged, once the Travis concerns are either fixed or removed from this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/517135360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/517147661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3616#issuecomment-517147661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3616","id":517147661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzE0NzY2MQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T06:58:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T06:58:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Next time, when you submit a new PR, please start creating a local branch from the latest master, in order to submit a clean PR.
