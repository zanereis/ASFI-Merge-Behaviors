However, that bug was probably not detected since it was masked by _this_ bug (which prevents groupBy from using its all-singly-valued-dimension optimization if some of the columns involved are virtual columns).\r\n\r\nI pushed a fix for the ExpressionVirtualColumn issue and updated the top comment. In this fix I just set it to always be \"true\". This isn't ideal, since it means singly-valued optimizations won't work on top of it, but I didn't see an easy way for the ExpressionVirtualColumn to determine upfront if it will be singly-valued or not. I think this should be possible in the future as we add more upfront type info to the expression system, so I added a comment saying as much.\r\n\r\n/cc @clintropolis

Non-caching impl exists and is super simple\r\n2. Caching impl also exists, and contains a non-caching instance within itself, acting as sort of a caching wrapper\r\n3.

I just found a Cli tool on the official website of jetbrains. We can parse the inspection rules with the `sh /Applications/IntelliJ\\ IDEA.app/Contents/bin/inspect.sh /code/druid /code/druid/.idea/inspectionProfiles/Druid.xml /code/druid/inspection-results-dir -v2 -d /code/druid/core` command. Finally, generate a validation report in xml format under the specified directory. So, can we use it with the `exec-maven-plugin`?\r\n\r\nThe downside is you still need to have Intellij installed and it can't be running when you run the inspection (according to their docs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508584993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/508587617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4865#issuecomment-508587617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4865","id":508587617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODU4NzYxNw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T22:57:08Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T22:57:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By the way, this should be fixed now by https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6313.
