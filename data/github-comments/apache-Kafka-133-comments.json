There are changes in here that definitely need a KIP, i.e, the refactoring in `Stores`, so that should be done separately. So i'd need to revert all those changes. Then i am having put a bunch of effort in to understand where you are heading, get it to compile, get tests to pass etc. I feel like i've been spinning my wheels and not getting anywhere.\r\nSo, i can't continue with this PR. I think the best course of action is to do this in smaller PRs. I.e, first do the StateStore hierarchy refactor. I can start that now. We need a KIP for the changes to `Stores`, so that is going to need to wait. There is also the `TopologyBuilder` etc stuff you were doing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271836999/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271839159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2267#issuecomment-271839159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2267","id":271839159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTgzOTE1OQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T10:55:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T13:31:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

work!\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm using Kafka connect to consume data from Kafka and push them to Elasticsearch using [kafka-connect-elasticsearch](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-elasticsearch).\r\nWe've defined a `ConsumerInterceptor` to be able to validate and apply minor transformations on records (i.e. map and filter operations). As far as I understand this new feature can be used to do the same thing ?\r\n\r\nIn our use case there's one limitation with this implementation. \r\nOur users can send either a JSON object (one value) or a JSON array (multiple values). In other words, a record can contain one or more values.\r\n\r\nBasically what we are doing is:\r\n\r\n1. Iterate over a list of records `ConsumerRecords onConsume(ConsumerRecords records)`\r\n2. For each record, we deserialize the data (we now have a `List<ObjectNode>` containing zero, one or more `ObjectNode`)\r\n3. For each `ObjectNode`, we check that no required fields are missing and we also apply minor transformations\r\n4. We return a list of records containing zero, one or more records.\r\n\r\nCould we change the `apply` method in the `Transformation` interface to return a list of records ?\r\n```diff\r\n-R apply(R record);\r\n+List<R> apply(R

concern that was raised also in KIP-81 (reusing the same memory pool logic on the consumer side) is whether the muting might impact group coordination. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion is to only allocate in the memory pool requests that are larger than a small threshold (~256bytes for example) and let smaller requests be allocated on the heap as usual. This should not add too much load/memory pressure on the broker (since we also have the queued.max.requests setting) and would allow heartbeats and other group requests to be processed uninterrupted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271888557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271891479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2344#issuecomment-271891479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2344","id":271891479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTg5MTQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T15:04:04Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T15:04:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Sorry, I missed the last part of your question. Transformations are 1:1 or 1:0 only for a reason. Connect tracks offsets for connectors automatically and allowing a flatMap-like transformation would at best make handling those offsets (which are defined by the connector in the case of sources) a lot harder or in the worst case break the guarantees the framework can provide. The intent of this feature is to only do lightweight transformations; Connect is still focused on moving data between systems and is not intended to be a fully-featured transformation engine. The basic transformations are being added just to support things like removing PII and doing very basic per-message data cleanup to avoid having to make extra copies of the data. If you get into more complicated transformations, you should take a look at Kafka Streams which is designed for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271951845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271952834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2299#issuecomment-271952834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2299","id":271952834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTk1MjgzNA==","user":{"login":"shikhar","id":74267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar","html_url":"https://github.com/shikhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shikhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T18:28:42Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T18:28:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Mogztter

is used by Kafka in relatively simpler ways than we need for `Connect`. Only Connect uses the recommender/validator/dependents/etc business, which is a somewhat contorted API. A better direction may be for Connect to move away from `ConfigDef`, and utilize the Connect data API, i.e. `Struct` `Schema`s for configs, with validation and recommendations using hooks. This would also allow JSON to be used with the existing `Converter` infra, which is a good fit given we have a REST API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271968706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271969606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1446#issuecomment-271969606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1446","id":271969606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTk2OTYwNg==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T19:29:48Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T19:29:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The old org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.ResetIntegrationTest failure is back but shouldn't be related to PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271969606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271970642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2074#issuecomment-271970642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2074","id":271970642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTk3MDY0Mg==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T19:33:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T19:33:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vahidhashemian Looks like KIP-97 (client compatibility) was merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271970642/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
