I was not necessarily looking for \"real\" documentation,but more like a list of ~5 bullets telling what part of the pieces that need to be added do what (high level). It's (just guessing) 10 minutes of work for someone who knows the stuff. \n\nI am sure others (and I guess I as well) can find out what is needed but it might take me the better part of a day, which I would rather spend writing the viz code, code I would happily contribute. One thing I am interested in is adding other libraries (plot.ly and highcharts to start). \n\nAnyway, from what I have seen, I like Caravel a lot and I appreciate the direction it is going.

do you realise that caravel is designed to run on a server\nrather than the users local computer? In our deployment caravel runs on an\nAWS cloud server and then multiple users (many of them on windows) access\nit via their browser from there. From a user perspective, caravel is\nalready windows compatible (and android and iOS and anything else with an\ninternet browser). The Unix requirement is for the machine that actually\nhosts the application, which are already generally Unix machines. If you're\nonly running windows servers then its very straightforward to set up a\nvirtual box and run caravel within that.\n\nI think that might be where the confusion is coming from.\n\nOn Thu, 30 Jun 2016 00:43 bf16574403, notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Windows...
