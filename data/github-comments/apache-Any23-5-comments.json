My first thought is: if the performance of this module is not as good as that of our current implementation, then in its current form, what is the added value?\r\n\r\nMy second thought is: the benchmarks do not test the Any23 `Extractor` wrappers around these rdf4j parsers, only the underlying parsers themselves. However, in Any23's `BaseRDFExtractor`, due to a lot of bugs in the semargl html parser, we had to preprocess the input stream using jsoup before passing \"clean html\" into the underlying parser. I am curious as to whether or not the `librdfa` parser would have any of those same html parsing bugs. If _not_, if I can take the preprocessing logic out of `BaseRDFExtractor` and move it to the semargl parser specifically, and **if** the librdfa parser can still pass the entire test suite without using the jsoup-preprocessed stream, then there would be a much better case for including it (as its performance would then likely eclipse our current rdfa performance without the preprocessing overhead).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/531068423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/531074410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/104#issuecomment-531074410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/104","id":531074410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTA3NDQxMA==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-13T02:22:37Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T02:22:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I created an [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ANY23-442) for this.

For clarity, \r\n\r\n> The TriXParser's underlying SAX2 parser (usually Xerces) should be configured, by default, to not read remote DTDs. This behavior can be overridden from the RDF4J side by tweaking the XMLParserSettings.LOAD_EXTERNAL_DTD option, or by setting the system property http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd to true.\r\n> However, I've just done a quick unit test at my end and it appears there is a regression in the default settings.\r\n> Long story short: you've discovered a bug in the TriXParser, thanks! And sorry it took so long for me to cotton on.\r\n> The short-term workaround in the Any23 code is to explicitly disable loading of external DTDs on the TriXParser:\r\n```parser.getParserConfig().set(XMLParserSettings.LOAD_EXTERNAL_DTD, false);```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/947831492/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/947865771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/205#issuecomment-947865771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/205","id":947865771,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEVXBM44f0ir","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-20T17:10:37Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T17:10:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks, @lewismc and @jeenbroekstra!
