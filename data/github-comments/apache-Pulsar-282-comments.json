@sijie -- I had not seen the retry-letter-topic. I am having a little trouble picture how it could be utilized for exponential back-off -- would I want to configure the consumer to have a single immediate, retry, and then the retry topic to have a higher delay? How would that delay be configured?\r\n\r\nThe PIP-58 proposal looks more similar to what I am imagining, without the use of additional topic. It would be even nicer to have pre-configured retry \"strategies\" (I believe that the AWS Java SDK has this concept), but a `reconsumeLater` would probably be enough to manually implement the back-off logic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/756880001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/756888226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8123#issuecomment-756888226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8123","id":756888226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Njg4ODIyNg==","user":{"login":"lsroudi","id":5458930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTg5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5458930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi","html_url":"https://github.com/lsroudi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsroudi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T17:14:57Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T17:14:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello,\r\nthank

in case, there's update from Jarek:\r\n\r\n> There is one problem with the charts, They are flawed. **They show\r\n>'workflows' not 'jobs'** and one workflow might mean many jobs :(. For\r\n>example the big number of workflows you can see  in Airflow yesterday come\r\n>from \"Label when reviewed\" workflows - each of which has 1 job that\r\n>takes 10 seconds or so. One workflow  can be 20/30 times more important\r\n>than another.\r\n\r\n> We cannot easily drill down to jobs, because we are using Github API to get\r\n>the information, but there are limits (max num requests/hr) and we are\r\n>already close to hitting it with the current setup.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it would be nice if you could reduce Actions workload ;-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/756983070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/756984731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9154#issuecomment-756984731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9154","id":756984731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Njk4NDczMQ==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T20:32:06Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T20:34:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see you've removed https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9069 `styfle/cancel-workflow-action` recently.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a workaround to use third-party actions (provided you have reviewed them):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2318/files\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you clone the action via SHA identifier during the build and use `locally cloned action`, so the action can't silently change after your review.\r\n\r\nAn alternative option is to raise INFRA ticket to allow `styfle/cancel-workflow-action` (and still use SHA-based action ids like `styfle/cancel-workflow-action@123123123...123123`)\r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/756984731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/756987607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9154#issuecomment-756987607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9154","id":756987607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Njk4NzYwNw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-08T20:39:28Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T20:39:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vlsi Thank you for your feedback.

You can set topic-level retention using `bin/pulsar-admin topics`. \r\nFor details, refer to https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9161\r\n\r\nFrom Pulsar 2.7.0, the namespace level policies are available on topic level. To enable topic level policy in Pulsar, you need to configure the following parameters in the `broker.conf` file. \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsystemTopicEnabled=true\r\ntopicLevelPoliciesEnabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've added this configuration in #9108 \r\nOnce those PRs are merged, all available topic-level policies are live on our website.
