Hi Clement. We are considering adding CI support, probably Travis.\r\n\r\nThe ECharts project depends on ZRender project. When developing locally, we use a soft link in `echarts/node_modules` to the local `zrender` project.\r\n\r\n**When using CI, how should we specify using the latest ZRender commit (rather than ZRender npm release) when building ECharts project?** \r\nFor example, there may be a new function in the latest ZRender commit, and a new ECharts commit calls this new function. Since the function is not included in the latest ZRender release on npm, `npm i zrender` will not help.\r\n\r\nnpm supports something like `npm install --save \"git://github.com/username/package.git#commit\"`, although I'm not sure this is helpful.\r\nCould you please give some idea about

though ZRender is currently under the control of ECharts core team, I still don't think it's the most optimal approach for this project. The core team for both projects could change over time, especially since one project is still under Baidu's organization while this is going through the Apache incubation process. This also makes it more difficult for contributors to contribute to ECharts because their builds may fail in the event ZRender has a breaking commit/change. In addition, this in my opinion complicates the release process (for both projects) more than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIf we _really_ need to add ZRender `master` branch as a dependency, I would recommend adding a CI job on ZRender to check for breaking changes on ECharts on each commit. In the very least, that will ensure that each commit on ZRender doesn't indirectly break ECharts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/464358457/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
