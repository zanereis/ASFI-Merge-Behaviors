don't think `gc.enabled` has anything to do with old metadata files. Those are known to be owned by the table so it is always okay to delete them. `gc.enabled` was a work-around for situations where we did not know whether data files were owned (e.g. snapshots).\r\n\r\n> I never considered sharing metadata files.\r\n\r\nIceberg makes a lot of decisions based on the core assumption that the known state of a table consists of the current metadata file and its references. That's the basis for snapshot expiration, for example. Once a snapshot is no longer referenced by table metadata it can be cleaned up. We introduced the option to be able to skip data file cleanup, but even that is a hack and we should be modelling location ownership.\r\n\r\nSharing metadata files violates the spec because each version of metadata replaces the last. I don't think that we need to consider how reusing or sharing would impact operations. I definitely sympathize with needing to support Nessie, but we were clear about the trade-off from the early days.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1556305688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1556308968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7663#issuecomment-1556308968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7663","id":1556308968,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cw2Po","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-21T22:19:16Z","updated_at":"2023-05-21T22:19:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm +1 for removing this property entirely.

Also in previous investagtion, IIUC, to implement DELETE & UPDATE for iceberg, we may need to finish #7110 first since Iceberg will use the metadata columns, file_path, file_pos to delete data.\r\n\r\nThe meta columns are required for UPDATE & DELETE on tables without pk. But for tables with pk, we can UPDATE & DELETE using the pk, which does not rely on https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7110. \r\nIn fact, UPDATE & DELETE in Paimon also only supports tables with pk.\r\n\r\nIMHO, we can first support tables with pk. While support for tables without pk can be added later, after https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7110 is finished.\r\n@luoyuxia @clownxc What are your thoughts on this?

It's still used in Flink tho.\r\n\r\nI agree, It'd be great to consolidate to have only one data files rewrite API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1561607714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1561721706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5659#issuecomment-1561721706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5659","id":1561721706,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85dFftq","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-24T18:12:18Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T18:12:18Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Merged, thanks @ConeyLiu !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1561721706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
