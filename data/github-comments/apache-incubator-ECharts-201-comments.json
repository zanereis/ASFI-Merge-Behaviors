It exactly is a canvas element in most time, when the iOS javascript engines display correctly, but sometimes it would not,  it was not found instead.  So `this.ctx` is `null`, so it will throw error when execute `this.ctx.dpr = this.dpr;`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/471868890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/471870976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10089#issuecomment-471870976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10089","id":471870976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTg3MDk3Ng==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-12T06:14:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T06:14:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!

use-case is almost like the [Confidence Band example](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/editor.html?c=confidence-band), but:\r\n\r\n- but for the line-series, we need the time axis\r\n- for the confidence band we could use a category axis\r\n\r\n\r\nany ideas for a workaround? e.g. \r\n\r\n1. maybe we can have 2 x-axis: a time-axis for the line-series and a category axis for the (confidence band stack)? \r\nBut those axis would need to be \"sychronized\": e.g. when we zoom in, both must zoom together, etc.\r\n1. or is it worth to try to keep only one time-axis and use a [custom series](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-custom.type) to draw the area?\r\nIf so, can someone link to an example, how to use custom-series with a time x-axis?  \r\nThe answer is **NO**. Custom series are just too slow (much slower than native series). Drawing the graphics basically works, but when we have like 10 charts with 5 series and 1k samples, the app is basically unusable.\r\n1. something completely different, that I didn't think
