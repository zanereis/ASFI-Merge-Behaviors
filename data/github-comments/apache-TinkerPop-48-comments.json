This sort of advanced configuration for both client and server is more than a user should have to do to get Cypher going with a TinkerPop implementation. It will be nice when we can push past scripts and into pure bytecode, but until then I guess this is what needs to be done.

I also think LICENSE files are copying over each other with the shading plugin. I assume that as this is a binary distribution artifact that the packaging should be similar to our zip distribution and follow that pattern, but I'll research a bit.

I think most folks have graphs with `single` so this change would be better for the majority\r\n2. if the user has `list`, `valueMap()`  won't blow up during serialization because it will just default to the first item in the list - user is forced to explicitly `by(fold())` (or something hopefully nicer) to force realization of the whole list of values.

My initial review mostly focused on getting myself familiar with the changes and I only had some high-level feedback/questions to provide.  The additional integration tests you added look really good. Performance numbers look acceptable - thanks for taking that step up front - as we are basically getting similar performance with a more simplified configuration/usage model for users.\r\n\r\nI've mentioned my concerns earlier about trying to push a change of this size/scope into the 3.4.x line.  Seeing the actual changes themselves right now didn't do much to relax those concerns even if it is all backward compatible. Note that we plan to open the 3.5.0 line of code in the next week or so (i.e. `master` will be 3.5.0) which I still feel is a better fit for a change of this scope. If we went with 3.5.0, I think you could view this as a more clean slate and just remove all the \"dead\" code rather than deprecating things. What do you think - can we go with 3.5.0?\r\n\r\nI will be doing some manual testing and additional review of this PR in the coming days.

You didn't remove any of the old tests (except for one and you had reason for doing so) and they still all work so that inspires confidence.\r\n\r\n> Adding a config parameter to fallback to old code.\r\n\r\nMore on this below toward the end....\r\n\r\n> Provide a document on working of the new code prior to merge which can be reviewed by the community for potential bugs/design deficiency.\r\n\r\nFrom a documentation perspective, I think that this PR should include:\r\n\r\n1. Fixes to the current reference documentation to:\r\na. remove references to deprecated configuration options that are now \"do nothing\"\r\nb. include details on best practices for configuring the driver given your new changes\r\n2. Write upgrade documentation to help promote the change and why it was necessary, pointing out what will stop working if you upgrade\r\n\r\nI think that leads me to my problem with merging this to 3.4.x - If someone upgrades from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2 with this change, their configuration options are no longer relevant. They will just be ignored so if the user managed to get their configuration \"perfect\" under the old model, they now have to change that given this upgrade. Perhaps that's a simple change (maybe??), but it's a change nonetheless. \r\n\r\nIn TinkerPop's rendition of semantic versioning, `z` upgrades in `x.y.z` should, ideally, have limited impact to users. We occasionally allow breaks in behavior (rarely, if ever, in compilation) in these release versions, but typically those breaks in behavior are the result of a bug fix that can't be resolved any other way.  \r\n\r\nSo that said, in a perfect world, your change destined fro 3.4.2 could be staged as a new feature that is parallel to what we already had and the \"switch\" you suggested earlier could do that. Preferably, we would default to the old functionality with an active switch users would select to utilize the new functionality. Perhaps the \"switch\" would just be a new `Channelizer` implementation? We could mark the current one as deprecated and then remove it completely in 3.5.0? I guess the changes run deeper than just the `Channelizer` so that may be too simple a solution....what were you thoughts on what a \"switch\" would look like?

According to [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/whereismysolution/2018/03/12/does-system-net-websockets-includes-a-keepalive-mechanism-which-automatically-takes-care-of-pingpong-control-frames/), it also responds to ping messages coming from the server.\r\nThat is why I'm wondering why Azure apparently still terminates the connections. It seems to ignore those keepalive pings for its check whether a connection is still alive.\r\nBut a PCAP file that actually shows the network traffic would give us clarity that a) pings are actually sent and answered and that b) Azure is actively terminating the connection which leads to the problem.\r\n\r\n@danielcweber \r\n\r\n> I tested it with a network card reset, killing all connections, just like we assume CosmosDB to. The appropriate exception is then thrown.\r\n\r\nYes, that's of course expected. But that doesn't tell us whether CosmosDB terminated the connections, although that's basically the only explanation I can think of. But to decide on a course of action we would also need to know why CosmosDB terminates connections. Does it really ignore keepalive pings or are they not sent / answered for some reason?\r\n\r\n> I think Gremlin.net should not wait for the next query to recover, but try right away.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't try it right away because the assumption was that connections were closed because the server is currently not available at all. In that case, it makes more sense in my opinion to wait for the next query and try then whether the server is available again (e.g., because it was restarted).\r\nIn your case where the connections were closed because they were inactive, it could make sense to make an attempt at creating new connections right away instead of throwing an exception.\r\nI would however prefer if we could avoid this situation from occurring in the first place instead of trying to work around it. If we can't avoid it for some reason, then we could make an attempt at creating new connections when all connections were closed before we throw an exception.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/491788326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/491790730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1105#issuecomment-491790730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1105","id":491790730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTc5MDczMA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T11:50:21Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T11:50:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> which, from a users perspective maintains the same behaviour as the old configuration, i.e. executing 16x32 queries in parallel.\r\n\r\nThanks for this clarification.

That said, now that you submit this pull request, it's made me question my approval/merging of the first one. The scope of your changes here are wide (perhaps not even complete) and that's indicative of a bigger problem I think. \r\n\r\nThe problem that I'm starting to realize is that we're changing the `GraphTraversal` API to account for sandboxing shortcomings. That's not the right way to go imo. If we don't like that sandboxing is forcing some of these odd casts in scripts then we should improve sandboxing itself (not work around the problem by altering the `GraphTraversal` API).\r\n\r\nSo, while I appreciate this pull request I think I'm going to have to be -1 on merge. Moreover, it's my intention to revert the changes on #1100. I think we should close both `TINKERPOP-2211` and `TINKERPOP-2201` as \"Wont Do\" and create a new ticket that describes the problem in terms of improving the sandbox. \r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense. Please let me know if you have any questions. We can leave this PR open for now in case others have thoughts on the matter. Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/493515681/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/493519635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1115#issuecomment-493519635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1115","id":493519635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzUxOTYzNQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-17T16:41:08Z","updated_at":"2019-05-17T16:41:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it's not easy to run the integration tests outside of maven integration right now:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/developer/#dotnet-environment\r\n\r\nor you can run with a full docker build: `docker/build.sh -t -i`\r\n\r\nOR you could temporarily merge in #1075 which would give you the docker hookup to start Gremlin Server with the test configuration and then you can run the .NET integration tests directly from the IDE.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/493519635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/493519856","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1117#issuecomment-493519856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1117","id":493519856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzUxOTg1Ng==","user":{"login":"sel-fish","id":15835510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM1NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15835510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish","html_url":"https://github.com/sel-fish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sel-fish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-17T16:41:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-17T16:41:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@spmallette Thanks for your response.
