For groovy script, could be as simple as dropping a jar in the proper location, i guess the bolt class path.\n3. for python, i think we should be able to put the modules in a modules folder and i think python script can refer to it from there, we will have to look at that packaging. \n\nI think it is a little more complicated and i think a separate would be needed to track it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/259444963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/259446446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/338#issuecomment-259446446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/338","id":259446446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTQ0NjQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"rkarthik29","id":7786127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODYxMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7786127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29","html_url":"https://github.com/rkarthik29","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkarthik29/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T15:46:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T15:46:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"this is exactly what we would need to do for python...\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/259446446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/259449238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/338#issuecomment-259449238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/338","id":259449238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTQ0OTIzOA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-09T15:57:19Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T15:57:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So that is similar to the pyleus stuff.

It appears to me that there are a number of these sorts of outlier analysis models that can be split into a common pattern:\n- Gather state via the profiler.\n- Operate on that state during the scoring mechanism\n\nFor these z-score based statistical outlier analysis techniques/models, that state comes in the form of a statistical summary or multiple statistical summaries in the case of median absolute deviation.  The scoring component is literally composing a modified z-score (scaled by MAD).  The question arises as to whether or not this model is better served in MaaS or as a stellar function.  Where I have come down in this PR is that I feel these very simple z-score or deviation-from-a-central-moment style outlier models fit better within Stellar due to their simplicity from a computational perspective.  Furthermore, it would seem to be less than ideal performance-wise to perform a network hop to a REST interface in MaaS to do simple subtraction and division.\n\nAn alternate architecture here would be to use MaaS and have the model pull the appropriate statistical context from the profiler's store in HBase.   I am sensitive to the possibility that the placement of model application within Metron may be a point of confusion and a consistent message is important.  I decided to go with simplicity and performance for the moment, but I'd love to hear if there is opposition in the audience.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/259801040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/259801689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/352#issuecomment-259801689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/352","id":259801689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTgwMTY4OQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T20:42:21Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T20:42:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One more thing, I also added a new lifecycle hook for the profiler.

The two port fields are defaulted to ES's defaults, so only hosts needs to be provided by the user on install.\n\nAs a note, only the first entry in es_hosts is used for the installed templates. It was already broken in the case of multiple entries anyway (because it tried to use the old es_url as a whole, but could be a comma delimited list), and I didn't want to put in logic around iterating through servers until one is found and/or retries etc.  It seems like a reasonable requirement to have working servers for something that should be done pretty soon after install.\n\nTo test this, I spun up an Ambari cluster as detailed https://www.evernote.com/shard/s530/sh/c5551fbd-0ac1-4861-89ce-9c5e37065c52/b13e05f39eaac1a6, along with a Docker instance of Elasticsearch to hit.

When I evaluated using 8191 I looked through 1 week of my http logs and found numerous legitimate URI fields which exceeded that, but none that exceeded 10922 (not that the latter doesn't happen, it's just much more rare).\n\nSpecifically I considered that legitimate URIs will usually contain CJK characters along with the standard URI delimiters.  Because CJK characters only use up to 3 bytes (afaict), non-CJK characters are only rarely used (i.e. if enough of them are used that this problem is encountered, it is probably nefarious, but definitely an extremely rare event), as well as the fact that 8191 seems to truncate some legitimate URI fields, I went with 10922.\n\nOf course, if the project is looking to drop its BETA flag before [METRON-542](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-542) (which would truncate based on URI length upstream from indexing and have other mitigations in place) has been implemented, I would agree that this should be 8191 for now.\n\nIf you'd still prefer 8191 after considering my previous comments, I'd be more than happy to swap it out, but I wanted to make sure to note that it may prevent a higher percent of legitimate URI fields from being indexed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/260363421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/260364180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/358#issuecomment-260364180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/358","id":260364180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDM2NDE4MA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-14T15:21:59Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T15:21:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We are planning on dropping the BETA for 0.3.0 for the release being cut today.

When _enrichedTuple_ comes in, we see that it has its mate in the cache, we join _originalTuple_ and _enrichedTuple_, and then we ack **the current tuple**, in this case, _enrichedTuple_. This means that we have never acked _originalTuple_, which caused Storm to re-send that tuple unnecessarily from the EnrichmentSplitter.\n\nSince none of the cached messages are ever acked, Storm does not know that they have been correctly handled.

I completely agree that we should ack every tuple that comes through in the `JoinBolt`.  I think, however, that they should be acked only on a successful join.  \n\nThe failure scenarios are currently handled thusly:\n- A failure in an enrichment (e.g. exception, hbase or mysql going down, etc) is handled by the enrichment adapter being robust enough to send an empty message even on failure\n- A failure in an enrichment bolt's infrastructure (e.g. the process dying or a machine failure) should be handled by the join failing and the original message replaying.  We anchor the message coming on the `message` channel in the `SplitBolt`, so it should get replayed.\n\nIf we ack every message as they come down the pipe, we could be in a situation where we've acked a message that never joins and never gets through.  Instead, I think we should ack every message on a successful join.\n\nAs of now, the tuple that sends the last enrichment segment in will get acked, which is definitely wrong.  What I would like to see is for the `streamMessageMap` to get augmented to track the tuples as well as the messages and for a successful join to result in all of the tuples in the map to get ack'd.  Possibly it's time for that map to actually be a proper class and it really only has to keep track of the tuple from the `message` stream.\n\nThe thing that worries me is that while I see the error, I still don't see how this could result in duplicate data and I don't see that in vagrant when I pass messages into kafka tuple-by-tuple (as in squid messages) for demos.  It appears to me that any message that does not ack the right tuple would never rejoin so it would never pass the join bolt the second time.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/260823662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/260839326","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/350#issuecomment-260839326","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/350","id":260839326,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDgzOTMyNg==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-16T02:54:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T02:54:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"changed

I made the change to the PR name; thanks for the tip there.\n\nI completely agree that we don't want to miss out on catching failures due to an enrichment source (like MySQL) or in the enrichment infrastructure. However, after we have put a tuple into the JoinBolt's cache, isn't it already past the point where these pitfalls could occur? If there is a failure in an enrichment, then Storm will time out while waiting for an ack that never takes place, so this message will be re-sent; but if the message is already in the cache, isn't its journey complete?\n\nMy thought with placing the ack there was (1) at this stage of the topology, that tuple has been correctly processed, and (2) for simplicity's sake so that we wouldn't have to modify `streamMessageMap`. I do agree that acking everything after the join has taken place also makes a lot of sense, and I can work on that if you would like.\n\nWe saw the duplicate data while running this in our development environment in EC2. Perhaps this is due to different ack timeout settings in the Storm topologies?

If you keep the ack where you have it, the message will never join if the enrichment worker gets killed, so the message will ultimately get dropped, which isn't ideal.\n\nUltimately, I think we can all agree that we need to ack at LEAST the tuple on the `message` stream, but I think that we want to ack it AFTER the join has happened.\n\nRegarding seeing dup data, I believe you.

The enrichment would finish and send the enriched data from the enrichment adapter to the join bolt but storm would've already triggered a replay.  The enrichment completing would have triggered the join to happen and the joined message to be emitted and the replay would trigger another copy of the message.\n\nIn this case, I'd suggest ensuring that either your enrichment is capped at maximum http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/javadocs/org/apache/storm/Config.html#TOPOLOGY_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_SECS or adjusting the message timeout in storm to be higher than this setting in storm.\n\nDo you have a custom enrichment that may be taking more than the storm topology message timeout?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/261080335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/261258001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/361#issuecomment-261258001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/361","id":261258001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1ODAwMQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T14:20:10Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T14:20:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/349\n\nThis is a dupe\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/261258001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/261259327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/361#issuecomment-261259327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/361","id":261259327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTMyNw==","user":{"login":"atopian","id":2446673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2446673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian","html_url":"https://github.com/atopian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atopian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T14:25:14Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T14:25:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#349 was a partial fix, but there were many, many other places that would error out when doing a `mvn clean package`.
