I think you have a challenging problem of wanting to scale an interaction that has many expectations around people, and human interactions that require kindness and patience. But there definitely could be some tweaks (e.g., sticking more to traditional expectations of a review, giving details when it's called for and not expecting pre-request expertise, and either minimizing tooling that is unexpected, defaulting to using the testing environment as the base for giving feedback to the contributor, or removing layers of abstraction so it's less confusing).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I outlined the details much better in that document.

Specifically, I've created a `integration-singularity.yml` file that uses a container base that provides Singularity (v3.5.1).\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: \"2.2\"\r\nservices:\r\n  singularity:\r\n    image: quay.io/singularity/singularity:v3.5.1\r\n    command: -F /etc/alpine-release\r\n    entrypoint: /usr/bin/tail\r\n    privileged: true\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /dev/urandom:/dev/random   # Required to get non-blocking entropy source\r\n```\r\nNote that I'm using privileged, which likely requires the sudo:true parameter for the testing setup. The traditional entrypoint is the Singularity executable, so I have a basic entrypoint/command to just keep the container running (and allow me to shell inside). Even outside of testing (which is fairly complicated and I'm hoping to not need to reproduce it locally) we can test if the basic interaction with Singularity would work inside the container.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose --log-level INFO -f \"scripts/ci/docker-compose/integration-singularity.yml\" up -d\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck that everything went up ok...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose --log-level INFO -f \"scripts/ci/docker-compose/integration-singularity.yml\" logs\r\nAttaching to docker-compose_singularity_1_7d898ecbdbb0\r\nsingularity_1_7d898ecbdbb0 | 3.10.3\r\n```\r\nAnd that we continued running...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker-compose --log-level INFO -f \"scripts/ci/docker-compose/integration-singularity.yml\" ps\r\n                  Name                                 Command               State   Ports\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndocker-compose_singularity_1_7d898ecbdbb0   /usr/bin/tail -F /etc/alpi ...   Up  \r\n```\r\nGreat! And then we can shell inside. We confirm the version of singularity.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker exec -it 0081d687eeb1 bash\r\nbash-5.0# which singularity\r\n/usr/local/bin/singularity\r\nbash-5.0# singularity --version\r\nsingularity version 3.5.1\r\n```\r\nThe basic thing we would need to do is start instances. We can actually build the SIF binary successfully, and let's do that first, pulling the container:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker exec -it 3e73d2d5b41e bash\r\nbash-5.0# which singularity\r\n/usr/local/bin/singularity\r\nbash-5.0# singularity pull docker://busybox\r\nINFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format\r\nINFO:    Starting build...\r\nGetting image source signatures\r\nCopying blob bdbbaa22dec6 done\r\nCopying config b075e856be done\r\nWriting manifest to image destination\r\nStoring signatures\r\n2020/01/22 20:24:24  info unpack layer: sha256:bdbbaa22dec6b7fe23106d2c1b1f43d9598cd8fc33706cc27c1d938ecd5bffc7\r\nINFO:    Creating SIF file...\r\nINFO:    Build complete: busybox_latest.sif\r\nbash-5.0# \r\n```\r\nNow let's start the instance.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash-5.0# singularity instance start busybox_latest.sif busybox\r\nERROR:   container cleanup failed: no instance found with name busybox\r\nFATAL:   container creation failed: mount /etc/localtime->/etc/localtime error: while mounting /etc/localtime: mount source /etc/localtime doesn't exist\r\n\r\nFATAL:   failed to start instance: while running /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/starter: exit status 255\r\n```\r\n\r\nokay, let's trace back and add this to our docker-compose yml file, we will mount as a volume from the host and redo the above.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: \"2.2\"\r\nservices:\r\n  singularity:\r\n    image: quay.io/singularity/singularity:v3.5.1\r\n    command: -F /etc/alpine-release\r\n    entrypoint: /usr/bin/tail\r\n    privileged: true\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime\r\n```\r\n\r\nZooming ahead, let's recreate and then start the instance:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash-5.0# singularity instance start busybox_latest.sif busybox\r\nINFO:    instance started successfully\r\n```\r\nSuccess! \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash-5.0# singularity instance list\r\nINSTANCE NAME    PID      IP              IMAGE\r\nbusybox          78                       /go/busybox_latest.sif\r\n```\r\nAnd we can exec to it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash-5.0# singularity exec instance://busybox echo \"HELLO\"\r\nHELLO\r\n```\r\nSo, although I'm hesitant that something about travis won't provide us with all the permissions that we need, I'm going to give it a try to add a docker compose file to reproduce this. My question for you is how I should go about providing this integration - the examples given previously expose services, and for this case we would want an environment with airflow and singularity in the same space. Do you have thoughts or examples for how to approach this?\r\n\r\nAnd then given that we can add a custom container, it would need to use one of the Singularity bases (note they are alpine), and then also include dependencies for airflow (or is the install already handled given the container, and happens before the testing?) Either way, if customization is needed on top of the Singularity base (that isn't handled by the testing suite) what would be the best way to do this - building the image elsewhere and using here, or building on demand?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577373099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577404876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5970#issuecomment-577404876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5970","id":577404876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzQwNDg3Ng==","user":{"login":"m1racoli","id":7921017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli","html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T21:57:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T21:57:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Comments for updating have been added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577404876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577434319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6211#issuecomment-577434319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6211","id":577434319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzQzNDMxOQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T23:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T23:26:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

We then create a macro which is a modified version of this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54922776/2958068\r\n> \r\n> The macro above provides the execution date in the same time zone as the DAG. Further we modify it to provide the actual scheduled date e.g. if scheduled to run on 2019-01-01 08:00 that's the datetime it provides (which in the default Airlow variables is the 'next execution date').\r\n\r\n@notatallshaw  thanks for the comment. Did setting `start_date` to the timezone you want work? We definitely remember trying something like that. But the airflow scheduler still did not run tasks before UTC midnight. Looking at the original code before this PR, it's not hard to see why. No matter what timezone we set the `start_date` to, this line was always skipping tasks as long as the execution_date is greater than `timezone.utcnow()`. So if the timezone we need is in Asia, this does not work till UTC midnight.\r\n\r\nBut this PR fixed / improved this. Now we no longer have to put tasks for date T on the DAG for execution_date T-1.\r\n\r\n```\r\nairflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py\r\n...\r\n            # don't consider runs that are executed in the future\r\n            if run.execution_date > timezone.utcnow():\r\n                self.log.error(\r\n                    \"Execution date is in future: %s\",\r\n                    run.execution_date\r\n                )\r\n                continue\r\n```\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577471036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577539102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7241#issuecomment-577539102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7241","id":577539102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzUzOTEwMg==","user":{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T07:25:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T07:25:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Just wondering how it helps ?

on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community!\nIf you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our\nContribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\n\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github\n.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows\nhow users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, itâ€™s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better ðŸš€.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack:

Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github\n.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows\nhow users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, itâ€™s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better ðŸš€.\n\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577883090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/577890923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7168#issuecomment-577890923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7168","id":577890923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3Nzg5MDkyMw==","user":{"login":"davlum","id":26053671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDUzNjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26053671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum","html_url":"https://github.com/davlum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davlum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-23T21:43:30Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T21:43:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The JSON you are passing will not turn into a K8S resource object.

But you get weird execution dates and ds_dates because Airflow normalizes the execution date to UTC before rendering the template or providing the context. So where you would normally expect Airflow to provide 2020-01-23 as the ds date it provides the previous day 2020-01-22 (day not date, it literally provides yesterday not the previous schedule date because this is a timezone issue not a schedule issue)\r\n\r\nThat's why we use the above mentioned macro system to provide dates in the correct timezones. With this we can happily use Airflow to schedule DAGs in whatever timezones is required. The only thing you still need to watch for are start dates and end dates and the execution date shown in the UI.\r\n\r\nHope that helps! We've been running this successfully on 1.10.3 and 1.10.6.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578180173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578205170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7133#issuecomment-578205170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7133","id":578205170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODIwNTE3MA==","user":{"login":"robinedwards","id":160865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDg2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards","html_url":"https://github.com/robinedwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robinedwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-24T16:36:48Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T16:36:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Interesting I have a hack in one of my operators which allows the selection of specific exceptions to retry for.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578205170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578225720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7252#issuecomment-578225720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7252","id":578225720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODIyNTcyMA==","user":{"login":"boring-cyborg[bot]","id":59518230,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTk1MTgyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/50386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/boring-cyborg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boring-cyborg%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-24T17:31:47Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T17:31:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Congratulations on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community!\nIf you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our\nContribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\n\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits](\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\nwill help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\nAdding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github\n.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows\nhow users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing\nlocally, itâ€™s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\nCommitters.\n\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better ðŸš€.\n\nIn case of doubts

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, itâ€™s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better ðŸš€.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578410035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578410485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7260#issuecomment-578410485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7260","id":578410485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODQxMDQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"JonnyDaenen","id":5166797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5166797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen","html_url":"https://github.com/JonnyDaenen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonnyDaenen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-25T14:26:12Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T14:26:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there a way to easily change the commit message without creating a new fork/commit?\r\nAlso, how should I improve my commit message?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578410485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/578410808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7260#issuecomment-578410808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7260","id":578410808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODQxMDgwOA==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-25T14:30:24Z","updated_at":"2020-01-25T14:31:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can also create a second commit using Github' Web UI.
