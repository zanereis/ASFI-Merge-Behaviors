If drivers don't present these instances, and it isn't defined HOW to instantiate a NodeImage or NodeSize class, then saying you must use an instance isn't helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso, GCP does not implement get_image:\r\n```\r\n>>> drv.get_image('FreeBSD')\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/jmg/work/openc2-aws-actuator/p/lib/python3.6/site-packages/libcloud/compute/base.py\", line 1343, in get_image\r\n    'get_image not implemented for this driver')\r\nNotImplementedError: get_image not implemented for this driver\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, there is no way to create a NodeImage other than the 80 that GCP provide, and that is problematic.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the docs for NodeImage pretty much tell you NOT to create your own (from https://libcloud.apache.org/apidocs/0.4.2/libcloud.base.NodeImage.html):\r\n```\r\nNodeImage objects are typically returned by the driver for the cloud provider in response to the list_images function\r\n\r\n>>> from libcloud.drivers.dummy import DummyNodeDriver\r\n>>> driver = DummyNodeDriver(0)\r\n>>> image = driver.list_images()[0]\r\n>>> image.name\r\n'Ubuntu 9.10'\r\nApart from name and id, there is no further standard information; other parameters are stored in a driver specific \"extra\" variable\r\n\r\nWhen creating a node, a node image should be given as an argument to the create_node function to decide which OS image to use.\r\n\r\n>>> node = driver.create_node(image=image)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll also note that these docs only say that a NodeImage *SHOULD* be given instead of *MUST* be given.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/606320053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/607285744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1445#issuecomment-607285744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1445","id":607285744,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzI4NTc0NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-01T14:33:19Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T14:33:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#1445](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445?src=pr&el=desc) into [trunk](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/commit/3c7f83f64ee72252a14ddc1e1f8cac4474a0be4b&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.00%`.\n> The diff coverage is `76.85%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=PYoduksh69)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##            trunk    #1445   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   86.15%   86.15%           \n=======================================\n  Files         373      373           \n  Lines       78147    78236   +89     \n  Branches     7696     7708   +12     \n=======================================\n+ Hits        67331    67408   +77     \n- Misses       7910     7919    +9     \n- Partials     2906     2909    +3     \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [libcloud/compute/base.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvY29tcHV0ZS9iYXNlLnB5) | `91.89% <20.00%> (-1.82%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [libcloud/test/compute/test\\_ssh\\_client.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9jb21wdXRlL3Rlc3Rfc3NoX2NsaWVudC5weQ==) | `91.84% <70.27%> (-3.26%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [libcloud/compute/ssh.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvY29tcHV0ZS9zc2gucHk=) | `78.57% <76.19%> (+3.57%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/test/compute/test\\_deployment.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9jb21wdXRlL3Rlc3RfZGVwbG95bWVudC5weQ==) | `95.59% <97.22%> (+0.07%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/compute/deployment.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvY29tcHV0ZS9kZXBsb3ltZW50LnB5) | `94.93% <100.00%> (+0.06%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1445?src=pr&el=footer).

And we also need a way for user to specify the event loop to use.\r\n\r\nThis could either be done on the global level (e.g. ``libcloud.async.set_event_loop(loop)``) and perhaps also on driver level, if user wishes to use different loop for different drivers (probably that likely).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/674256104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/674458806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1460#issuecomment-674458806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1460","id":674458806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQ1ODgwNg==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-15T23:50:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-15T23:50:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for contributing to this issue.
