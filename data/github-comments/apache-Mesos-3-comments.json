Yep, I see this is not new for the project, and I was missing a lot of context when I initiated this PR. So now we have two options, from my point of view:\n- Dismiss this PR. This integration brings small or no value to the project (at a cost of a .travis.yml and keeping the integration active), as the free version of travis does not meet all the CI requirements you currently have covered with Jenkins.\n- Accept the PR. This will fix the \"red flag\" we can see in all the PRs, and this job will potentially provide quicker feedback as we are only compiling in the end (while Jenkins will bring the results of all the test coverage later)\n  \n  Please, make the decision bearing in mind what's more convenient for the project... No rancor at all if you close without merge ;) (it was an exercise requiring small efforts). But I'd appreciate the related Jira issue is closed (MESOS-5655) and you actually disable Travis to prevent these red crosses to add noise to all PRs.\n  \n  Best,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/246852064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/247172867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/165#issuecomment-247172867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/165","id":247172867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzE3Mjg2Nw==","user":{"login":"dcaba","id":15898942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODk4OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15898942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba","html_url":"https://github.com/dcaba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcaba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T22:12:57Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T22:12:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"BTW,\n\n   I've just remembered a benefit of keeping this active (that will not affect too much that decision);

Thanks for the update; this parallel CI job in travis (this PR was bringing) was not adding too much benefits (just the nice github <-> travis integration, that can show green ticks or red crosses in PRs submitted in this repo?), and it was only worth to fix the red crosses while the integration was still enabled. Closing PR then! Best!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/284106797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/comments/284135227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mesos/pull/165#issuecomment-284135227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mesos/issues/165","id":284135227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDEzNTIyNw==","user":{"login":"haosdent","id":950759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDc1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/950759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent","html_url":"https://github.com/haosdent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haosdent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-04T07:49:32Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T07:49:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"yah, actually apache jenkins have integrated with github.
