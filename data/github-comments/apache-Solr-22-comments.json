e.g. uneven distributions of re-ranked docs across the shards, we were thinking about deploying a temporary, simpler fix for our local installation, perhaps a variant of what @dsmiley mentioned in his last comment: To adjust the scores of all re-ranked documents locally in the shards to make them larger than the largest original score of the documents before re-ranking. There is still be the possibility that the original scores differ per shard, but since we also accept that for normal ranking (except for distributed IDF via global statsCache), we figured we could ignore that. We would also accept that the scores of all re-ranked docs are always better than the highest non-reranked score, and we'd set reRankDocs to be our intended total number divided by the actual numbers of shards we're using.
