Thanks for the contribution.\n\nCan SparkInterpreter handle restart SparkContext locally without adding a new method in Interpreter class? ie. restart SparkContext only, not whole interpreter process.\n\nReasons i think restart only SparkContext is is better,\n- We can keep Interpreter class simple. One less thing to understand to implement new interpreter for Zeppelin.\n- When dependency loader loads some libraries, restarting SparkContext can reuse loaded libraries, but restarting interpreter process can not use these libraries in current architecture. So user may have different libraries loaded in his environment after restart and it can be very confusing, especially when restarting is done silently.\n\nWhat do you think @akhiluanandh ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/133769850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/133769881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/244#issuecomment-133769881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/244","id":133769881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzc2OTg4MQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-23T01:48:02Z","updated_at":"2015-08-23T01:48:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here's summary of changes made by this patch.\n\n##### Add spark-dependencies submodule\n\nspark-dependencies maven submodule is created. It is responsible for copy all the spark/hadoop dependencies under interpreter/spark/dep.\n\nSpark/Hadoop dependencies in spark maven submodule is set to provided, while they're loaded on runtime from either interpreter/spark/dep or SPARK_HOME,HADOOP_HOME.\n\n##### bin/interpreter.sh\n\nbin/interpreter.sh checks if SPARK_HOME and HADOOP_HOME is defined.\nIf they're not defined, it adds interpreter/spark/dep into classpath.\nIf they're defined, it does add directories from SPARK_HOME and HADOOP_HOME into classpath. \n\nIt also searches for spark-*.conf file under SPARK_HOME/conf and automatically add them into ZEPPELIN_JAVA_OPTS.\n\n##### remove use of travis-install.sh from .travis\n\nWhile travis-install.sh reduces logs, it brings some problem.\nWhen build is hanging for some reason, before travis-install.sh gets error and printing them, travis terminates the build container. It makes very hard to debug.\n\nThis is ready to review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/133769881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/133773967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/246#issuecomment-133773967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/246","id":133773967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzc3Mzk2Nw==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-23T02:33:44Z","updated_at":"2015-08-23T02:33:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ready
