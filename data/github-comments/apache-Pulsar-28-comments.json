Create a namespace with 2 bundles (0x0000_0x7fffff and 0x800000_0xffffff) \r\n 2. Invoke the split in parallel on both bundles\r\n\r\nI think the validation logic might have some flaw here. It would be good to log more info to help with the debugging. This is in `NamespaceBundles`:\r\n```java\r\npublic void validateBundle(NamespaceBundle nsBundle) throws Exception {\r\n        int idx = Arrays.binarySearch(partitions, nsBundle.getLowerEndpoint());\r\n        checkArgument(idx >= 0, \"Cannot find bundle in the bundles list\");\r\n
