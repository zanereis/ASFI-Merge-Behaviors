I looked through the PR but I was taking notes in a text file :) Before I start nitpicking on code in detail, a bunch of high level comments:\r\n\r\n* Overall, this looks like a reasonable compromise and I don't have ideas on how to make this much better - unless you want to resurrect the discussion and try to come up with such ideas :) In particular, if we had unlimited time for design, I'd like to see the following. Perhaps that's like Beam-3.0 stuff, but anyway.\r\n** It'd be cool if we could achieve more unification between wrapper transforms like AvroIO vs. TextIO vs. XmlIO vs. TFRecordIO (i.e. not duplicate much code when adding dynamic-destinations support to all of them) but that's topic for another PR.\r\n** It'd be cool to have even more dynamicity, e.g. have an AvroIO.Write that can use different schemas for different destinations, as I suggested on the beam-dev thread https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/40f123534f452fe85e74f9cf2d1a7d043f52aa1f2920e311612ac074@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E .\r\n* WriteFiles seems to now unconditionally GBK all the data. Should we have a \"fast path\" for the common case, when writing unwindowed data to a single destination?\r\n* Test coverage for the new code seems mainly represented by a new TextIO test with dynamic destinations. I think there needs to be more explicit coverage for the new code in WriteFiles and FileBasedSink, and a dynamic destinations AvroIO test. Maybe run unit tests with coverage also - I think we should see near-100% coverage in these classes (FileBasedSink, WriteFiles) from running only their own unit tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/310510189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/310512239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3426#issuecomment-310512239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3426","id":310512239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDUxMjIzOQ==","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T21:48:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T21:48:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready
