Matei, Patrick's last a few comments have already convinced me to remove the \"primary\" notion from a user's perspective.

Internally, to keep code relies on `primaryResource` intact (one example is the cluster deploy mode in a standalone cluster), we can still pick the first entry in `--jar` for Java/Scala apps and `--main-file` for Python apps as primary.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51145806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51146059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-51146059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":51146059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTQ2MDU5","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-05T03:31:49Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T03:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"finally, \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51146059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51146388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1772#issuecomment-51146388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1772","id":51146388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTQ2Mzg4","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-05T03:38:59Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T03:38:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging this in master.

So I did yet another revert, and yes the tests PASS again.  \n\nBTW after each of these reverts, I manually viewed the SparkSQL.scala file after each revert to ensure we are seeing the expected version of \"OCTET_LENGTH\" vs \"OCTET_LEN\".  Specifically the \"OCTET_LENGTH\" always results in the SOF failure and the \"OCTET_LEN\" always results in the HiveQLSuite passing.\n\nSo I have established clearly  the following:  \n    the strlen branch on my fork fails with SOF if we rollback the commit that changes OCTET/CHAR_LENGTH -> OCTET/CHAR_LEN. \n\nThe steps I showed above should be available for anyone to repeat to see themselves.
