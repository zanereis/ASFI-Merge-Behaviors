You can add path after `storePathCommitLog`. \r\nBut, one thing to be noticed, if your server is started with only one commit log path, you have to restart the server to change it to multi-path-commit-log mode. Because `mappedFileQueue` in class `Commitlog` is initialized during start up.\r\nOne way to avoid this restart is to add a `MessageStoreConfig#MULTI_PATH_SPLITTER`(default is ',' and can be changed by system property \"rocketmq.broker.multiPathSplitter\") after origin single storePathCommitLog, e.g. \"~/store/commitlog,\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/925529140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/925683780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3369#issuecomment-925683780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3369","id":925683780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl843LNBE","user":{"login":"liuxuzxx","id":31197548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTk3NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31197548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuzxx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuzxx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-23T10:21:02Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T10:21:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"why?????","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/925683780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/925691775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2937#issuecomment-925691775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2937","id":925691775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl843LO9_","user":{"login":"loongs-zhang","id":38336731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzM2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38336731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/loongs-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-23T10:33:08Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T10:33:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

@wenfengwang\r\n\r\n看到RocketMQ相关序列化组件使用的是fastjson，去fastjson下查看了下相关的issule，例如这个：https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/issues/3821 但是好像作者并没有回应这个问题也没有关闭，不知道这个是不是fastjson的一个问题，fastjson在Map<Integer,xxx> 这种形式的序列化确实会存在不符合json规范定义的情况(目前搜索到的json规范定义要求key是string类型)，也看到讨论的issule，但是作者好像没有做回复，目前找到一种方案如下：\r\n\r\n```java\r\n//序列化的时候，增加SerializerFeature配置，这样子数字key就会加上双引号了\r\nString temp = JSON.toJSONString(result, SerializerFeature.WriteNonStringKeyAsString);\r\n```\r\n不知道rocketmq要是这样子修改会有多大改动，只是感觉现在的这个json形式不符合规范！","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/926309385/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/926372655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3174#issuecomment-926372655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3174","id":926372655,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl843N1Mv","user":{"login":"zhangjidi2016","id":18254437,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU0NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18254437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjidi2016","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjidi2016/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-24T06:11:00Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T06:11:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RongtongJin
