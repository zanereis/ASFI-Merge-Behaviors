I think upgrade of storm should still work with older topology jars. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612697278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612701274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5306#issuecomment-2612701274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5306","id":2612701274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI3MDEyNzQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T15:22:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:44:46Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=garrick.dasbach@inin.com\">garrick.dasbach@inin.com</a>:</i>\n<p>Not sure how far out the JStorm port is, but in the interim, maybe it would be sufficient to make the Kafka fetch asynchronous.
