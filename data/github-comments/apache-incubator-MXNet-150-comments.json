So I'm sorry not to implement APIs for these functions.\r\n\r\nTo save the parameters, you have to pay attention to the four networks in ```ddpg.py```:\r\n\r\n* ```self.qfunc_target``` (mxnet executor)\r\n* ```self.policy_target``` (mxnet executor)\r\n* ```self.policy``` (self-defined class)\r\n* ```self.qfunc``` (self-defined class) \r\n\r\nFor the two executors, call ```mx.nd.save``` to save the executor's ```arg_dict``` (and correspondingly ```mx.nd.load``` to load). For the self-defined classes, you might want to expose their executors to call ```mx.nd.save``` to save the ```arg_dict```.\r\n\r\nTo visualize the trainining process, basically, just call the env's internal method ```env.render()```.

As I increase the environment variable MKL_NUM_THREADS, I see CPU usage increase proportionately in both test, until it peaks at the number of physical cores on the machine. (Additionally changing MXNET_CPU_WORKER_NTHREADS does not seem to have an additional effect, either on speed or CPU usage.) So, the Intel multithreading libraries appear to be working.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I see a substantial (183%) increase in speed for the numpy test, but only a 17% improvement in speed in the mxnet test. The cProfile results are similar (although MKL was a bit faster generally than OpenBLAS for the mxnet test on this machine).

my point of view, one way to support CuDNN optimization is to enable multi-step forwarding (e.g add an argument in `__call__` called step_num or seq_len) in the RNNCell and add a flag in `__init__` to determine whether to use CuDNN . However, we will also need to add another operator to convert the biases and weights to the \"parameter\" in mx.sym.RNN. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ML-HK/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/recurrent.py#L90-L120","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/271778292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/271778303","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4619#issuecomment-271778303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4619","id":271778303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTc3ODMwMw==","user":{"login":"formath","id":6040127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDAxMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6040127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath","html_url":"https://github.com/formath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/formath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T04:57:16Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T04:57:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/271778303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/271785618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4227#issuecomment-271785618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4227","id":271785618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTc4NTYxOA==","user":{"login":"mz24cn","id":1301113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDExMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn","html_url":"https://github.com/mz24cn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mz24cn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T06:00:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T06:00:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What's the intention and benfits that you rename title case operator names to be lower case, besides bringing trouble to others which directly reference the code!\r\nThe alias name is not used by MX...

Em...Just now I get another GTX750Ti(2GB) and I build a CUDA8/CUDNN5.1/MXNET environment on another computer(all the same, except the CPU Intel I7x8).\r\nThe same thing happened. On this card I get the poor performance too(max to about 45 samples/sec when training my own SSD example, while I get about 80 samples/sec on my first GTX750Ti).\r\nI checked nvidia-smi of both GTX750Ti per second when training, and I found that the GTX750Ti with good performance showed stable volatile GPU-Util around 95%, but the one with bad performance showed quite a unstable volatile GPU-Util (ranged from 20% to 95%). Later I checked GTX1060 too, and its volatile GPU-Util ranged from 0% to 49%.\r\nSo it seems like there is something wrong in my latest cuda/mxnet environment built, not GTX1060's problem. \r\nBut I can't remember the difference because the first GTX750Ti environment was built long time ago.
