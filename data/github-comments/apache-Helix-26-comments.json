One suggestion: when this gets merged into master, we will not be squashing the commits to preserve them. As such, you might want to squash all of your own commits on top of the previous author's commit so that it's just one single commit that makes it mergeable back into master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1092878856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1092885415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2024#issuecomment-1092885415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2024","id":1092885415,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5BJBun","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-08T13:54:44Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T13:54:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @hmhagberg - thank you for the question. The historical context is this: IdealState is the de-facto definition for a resource with its required fields, but applications wanted to add more application-specific configs. But the original intention was to make IdealStates immutable (not enforced, unfortunately), so Helix added support for ResourceConfig. This is why things can work without ResourceConfig, but the intention is for a given resource to have a ResourceConfig and an IdealState pair.\r\n\r\nBut the log message seems to be coming from ConfigAccessor, which is entirely used by the application logic. Are you trying to ConfigAccessor#get? This, I don't believe, is being called by the Helix controller pipeline.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1092885415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
