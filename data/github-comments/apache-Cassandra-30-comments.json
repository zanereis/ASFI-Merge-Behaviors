Please find my response here:\r\n\r\n> - Combine ranges instead of splitting - in ecChronos we saw huge improvements in some scenarios (when the data is low or empty tables) compared to repairing 1 vnode at a time. This improvement scaled with amount of vnodes, although it might've been related to overhead due to running repairs through JMX. Not sure but might be worth investigating.\r\n\r\n1. Generally, empty tables or tables with a small amount of data runs through pretty fast, in seconds, so it is not a major issue for smaller/empty tables.\r\n2. The current framework already has support to combine ranges through a setting ([src/java/org/apache/cassandra/repair/autorepair/AutoRepair.java:266](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3598/files#diff-b9a857a0f20a2f239d5e27511e4db19c87704faccb17b5205b5406e69ea08f52R266))\r\n\r\n> - Major versions, during major version upgrades like 3 -> 4 we weren't supposed to run repairs. If Cassandra plans to keep this then it would be nice for repairs to automatically pause during major version upgrades.\r\n\r\nThis is a great suggestion, and the framework can be enhanced easily - I just filed a new sub-ticket [CASSANDRA-20013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-20013) to track this \r\n\r\n> - Observabliity, i saw there're metrics but it would also be nice to see repair status with nodetool.\r\n\r\nThere is already a new nodetool command that would print the current status. Please take a look at it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJWxjEi-mBABPMZ3VWJ9w5KavWfJETAGxfUpsViPcPo/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.887cdlihznq7).\r\n\r\n> - Repair priority per table, not per node.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it will repair the tables randomly, but it can be enhanced to add a priority as a CQL table property that an end user can configure, which can also be enhanced easily. Just added this enhancement to the ticket mentioned above.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2427154086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2430999520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3626#issuecomment-2430999520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3626","id":2430999520,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM6Q5hvg","user":{"login":"bereng","id":6973517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzM1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6973517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng","html_url":"https://github.com/bereng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-23T06:12:14Z","updated_at":"2024-10-23T06:12:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ci
