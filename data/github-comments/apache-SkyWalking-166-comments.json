I didn't write these codes, could you do a little more research about the difference? Then we could have a more reasonable choice.\r\n\r\nWe can refer to [analysis-stop-analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-analyzer.html) and [analysis-standard-analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-analyzer.html)  to get the difference of the \"stop\" and the \"standard\" type analyzer.\r\n\r\nIn short the \"standard\" type analyzer will not ignore the numbers, and in this case we can query by numbers in the endpoint name.\r\n\r\nIt's indeed a matter of choice, but I tend to choose the \"standard\" analyzer.  We usually query  with a complete endpoint name, it is confused that the results are not matching the numbers in the querying
