Sender adapter will consume message from a topic, Receiver adapter will produce message to a topic. For Receiver adapter, there is no certain time when it is called, if it's called once a month and keeping connection open for a long time to just send a message a month is not a good idea. That is why we decided to close and re-connect to broker everytime.\r\nBtw, Is there any way to tell the Pulsar client (that has producers only) that it should close the connectivity if there is no message to publish after an amount of time, and re-connect to brokers when it needs to send a message again?\r\nFor the \r\n\r\n> If we only send the schema version, there is no way for us to verify if the client is using the right schema.

I think skipping verifying SchemaInfo will make sense, if the client itself can assures the correctness of schema version.

Of course we tested our application on both `testing` and `staging` before going live and we didn't find any compatibility issues. Unfortunately as we deployed the new version the scenario described [above](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7682#issue-667034747) happened in a much larger scale affecting several consumers at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe backlog started to grow quite a bit so we decided to downgrade back to 2.5.1. That helped a bit but some consumers were definitely still stuck. Upgraded again to 2.6.0, this time with the `autoSkipNonRecoverableData` set to `true`. With these settings and jobs that periodically restart our pods in Kubernetes we managed to get it more stable.\r\n\r\nOf course we would like to avoid having to kill our pods on a regular basis so it would be nice to find a solution.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the logs on the client side there's nothing relevant coming from the Pulsar library, it just reports logs like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"level\":\"debug\",\"name\":\"cloud-nodes-service-3681597d6aa5773d\",\"severity\":\"DEBUG\",\"subscription\":\"cloud-nodes-service\",\"time\":\"2020-08-11T07:34:27Z\",\"topic\":\"persistent://public/default/AlarmEventsUpdated\"}\r\n{\"cnx\":\"10.1.15.135:40246

the server side (mostly the Pulsar broker) we got plenty of exceptions though, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\npulsar-broker-84bf4f59d6-lgzzp pulsar-broker 07:35:58.848

That PR mentioned the problem, but it's only a part.\r\n\r\nI'll explain the real reason of memory leak and why the bugfix works here. If you don't care, just go to the last chapter: **Safe createReader implementation**.\r\n\r\n## Some implementation knowledge\r\n\r\nFirst, `Reader` holds a shared pointer of `ReaderImpl`:\r\n```c++\r\nclass Reader {\r\n    std::shared_ptr<ReaderImpl> impl_;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, the synchronous `createReader` method is passing a `WaitForCallbackValue` object to asynchonous `createReaderAsync`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nResult Client::createReader(/* ... */, Reader& reader) {\r\n    Promise<Result, Reader> promise;\r\n    createReaderAsync((/* ... */, WaitForCallbackValue<Reader>(promise));\r\n    Future<Result, Reader> future = promise.getFuture();\r\n\r\n    return future.get(reader);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile a `Promise<Result, Reader>` holds an `InternalState<Result, Reader>`, which holds a `Reader`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate <typename Result, typename Type>\r\nstruct InternalState {\r\n    /* Other fields... */\r\n    Type value;\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate <typename Result, typename Type>\r\nclass Promise {\r\n     std::shared_ptr<InternalState<Result, Type> > state_;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we know, in `createReader`, the `promise` holds a shared pointer of `InternalState<Result, Reader>` that has a `Reader` field that holds a shared pointer of `ReaderImpl`. **[1]**\r\n\r\n## Why the memory leak occurs\r\n\r\nIt seems that `createReader` would work fine, because `createProducer` and `subscribe` use similar code to wrap asynchonous `xxxAsync` methods.\r\n\r\nBut things get different in `ReaderImpl`, it has a field:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReaderCallback readerCreatedCallback_;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ReaderCallback` is a typedef of `std::function<Result, Reader>`, and it's constructed with `WaitForCallbackValue<Reader>` object in `createReader`. Therefore, a `ReaderImpl` holds a `WaitForCallbackValue<Reader>`, which holds a `Promise<Result, Reader>`. **[2]**\r\n\r\nCombine **[1]** and **[2]**, the callback holds a shared `Reader` of `InternalState`, but it's not released until `Promise` of callback released, while the `ReaderImpl` shared the `Promise` that caused it's reference count not being 0 after `createReader` returned and `promise` destructed. Even if `promise` must have been completed before `createReader` returns. The `ReaderImpl` just hold an useless `Promise`.\r\n\r\n## Why the bugfix works\r\n\r\nLook back to the bugfix, why it works? Because it changes `Promise` to `Promise&` in `WaitForCallbackValue`, which means there's only one `Promise` instance. No copy of `Promise` happens,  the `InternalState` has only **one** Promise owner. When `promise` destructed after `createReader` returned, the `InternalState`'s reference count became 0 and released.\r\n\r\nTips: `Future` also shared the `InternalState`, it should be changed to weak pointer, but it doesn't matter here.\r\n\r\n## Alternative solution\r\n\r\nChange `Promise&` in `WaitForCallbackValue` to `Promise` again, the valgrind's result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==14509==    definitely lost: 160 bytes in 1 blocks\r\n==14509==    indirectly lost: 23,054 bytes in 30 blocks\r\n==14509==      possibly lost: 1,338 bytes in 9 blocks\r\n==14509==    still reachable: 152,755 bytes in 197 blocks\r\n==14509==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd modify `ReaderImpl::handleConsumerCreated`, clear the `readerCreatedCallback_`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid ReaderImpl::handleConsumerCreated(Result result, ConsumerImplBaseWeakPtr consumer) {\r\n    auto self = shared_from_this();\r\n    readerCreatedCallback_(result, Reader(self));\r\n    readerImplWeakPtr_ = self;\r\n    readerCreatedCallback_ = [](Result, Reader) {\r\n    };  // Do nothing, just release the older callback, which is a WaitForCallbackValue\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the valgrind's result became:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==14986==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\r\n==14986==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\r\n==14986==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\r\n==14986==    still reachable: 12,621 bytes in 145 blocks\r\n==14986==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <pulsar/Client.h>\r\nusing namespace pulsar;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    Client client(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\");\r\n    ReaderConfiguration readerConfig;\r\n    Reader reader;\r\n    Result result = client.createReader(\"Foo\", MessageId::earliest(), readerConfig, reader);\r\n    if (result != ResultOk) {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    reader.close();\r\n    client.close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Safe `createReader` implementation\r\n\r\nAfter knowing the problem is the callback,  you can just implement your own safe synchronous `createReader` method using `createReaderAsync`:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <atomic>\r\n#include <chrono>\r\n#include <thread>\r\n\r\n#include <pulsar/Client.h>\r\n\r\nnamespace pulsar {\r\n\r\ninline Result createReader(Client& client, const std::string& topic, const MessageId& startMessageId,\r\n                           const ReaderConfiguration& conf, Reader& reader) {\r\n    Result result;\r\n    std::atomic_int completed{false};\r\n    client.createReaderAsync(topic, startMessageId, conf,\r\n                             [&result, &reader, &completed](Result result_, Reader reader_) {\r\n                                 if (result_ == ResultOk) {\r\n                                     reader = reader_;\r\n                                 }\r\n                                 result = result_;\r\n                                 completed = true;\r\n                             });\r\n    while (!completed) {\r\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\r\n    }\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}  // namespace pulsar\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use `createReader(client, /* ... */, reader)` instead of `client.createReader(/* ... */, reader)`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/672985677/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/673001811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7803#issuecomment-673001811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7803","id":673001811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzAwMTgxMQ==","user":{"login":"sijia-w","id":53718687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzE4Njg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53718687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w","html_url":"https://github.com/sijia-w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijia-w/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T17:13:23Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T17:13:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jennifer88huang Please help review the changes.
