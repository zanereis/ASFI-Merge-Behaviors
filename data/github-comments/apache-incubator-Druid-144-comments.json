Since the data you need to join in is in the millions, perhaps you need to use the lookups-cached-single extension.\r\n\r\nSince you don't have a large dataset, perhaps using a regular relational database is a better fit, especially if you have a lot of writes. Vertica might suit you well. \r\nIn case you'd like to use Druid, there are some caveats with lookups. They are experimental and if used, you need to be careful in cases your lookups are not in a 1:1 relationship with the keys. For instance, we have a lookup that maps a product Id into one of a few product categories.\r\nThis lookup works well for splits (i.e. groupings) and we don't notice a performance hit there. However, if a user filters on that lookup definition and innocently selects a single category, then Druid reverse-looks-up all the product IDs and translated the original query into one that now has millions of filter terms. \r\nTherefore, we try to stick to 1:1 lookup definitions which just rewrite Ids to nice labels. \r\nThere's also support for joins in the works in which smallish datasources get loaded to each cluster node and can then be joined into the master datasource.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of your data needs to receive updates more frequently than other data. You could segregate the data into separate datasources and issue union queries across the datasources. \r\n

(1), I agree with using \"caffeine\" as the default if caching is enabled on broker/historical but no type has been specified.\r\n\r\nFor (2), since the configuration is different for \"local\" vs. \"caffeine\", I think we should just drop the \"local\" type completely instead of having a transition period where \"local\" means the same thing as \"caffeine\" (since the user would have to update to a different configuration format anyway if we switched the implementations internally).\r\n\r\nFor (3) I don't have a strong opinion; having default behavior rely on an extension feels a little weird to me, if something will always be loaded I feel like it should be in core, but as others have pointed out it could be useful as a reference. \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSo in terms of a sequence of steps I'm thinking:\r\n1. Update all docs and examples to use \"caffeine\" as default instead of \"local\", strongly indicate in the docs that \"local\" is totally inferior to Caffeine and will be deprecated->removed.\r\n2. Decide after that whether to keep the cache implementations in core or as extensions\r\n3. Remove \"local\" implementation completely in a later release\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFor 0.10.1 release, since it looks like it might take some time to reach consensus on all aspects of this issue, should we just update the docs/examples to use Caffeine as default and recommend that users switch from \"local\"?
