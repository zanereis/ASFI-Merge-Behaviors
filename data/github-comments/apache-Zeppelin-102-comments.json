Concerning Travis:\n   It would need to be a username and password local to the machine the test is being executed, further it might need to be user that can potentially ssh to the machine as the `/etc/pam.d/sshd` is being used. For now I think it would be fine to consider this as a manually test.\n2. I'll be happy to provide the documentation. Does this have to be a new PR or can a PR be of multiple types?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258144506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258154810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1589#issuecomment-258154810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1589","id":258154810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODE1NDgxMA==","user":{"login":"hkropp","id":8571358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzEzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8571358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp","html_url":"https://github.com/hkropp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkropp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T14:17:49Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T14:17:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Provided documentation as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258154810/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258160935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1590#issuecomment-258160935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1590","id":258160935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODE2MDkzNQ==","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T14:39:14Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T14:39:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz that function `loadAllNotes` is called only from constructor and when loading from constructor you're either in anonymous mode, or in shiro and loading all notes by anonymous (public).

In regards to getting python dependencies installed for our CI tests, I would be glad to help with that. With that in mind though I think I'll hold off on committing a unit test for pyspark until then since I'll probably get around to doing this anyway right after this PR gets merged, so not much point in going through the trouble of excluding the test in the `pom.xml`. \n\nThe reason I put the backend files in `/lib` and not in `/interpreter/python/lib` is because I didn't want to worry about editing multiple versions of the same file if these were to be used by another interpreter (eg, I would also want to have them in `/interpreter/spark/lib`). I suppose it may be possible to just have a top-level `lib/python` get copied directly to both directories through maven, but I didn't see the added complexity being worth it.\n\nAlso on a final note @Leemoonsoo , the previous CI failures have alerted me to another issue: With `%pyspark`, the output from the last statement in a paragraph no longer gets automatically printed, eg\n\n``` python\n%pyspark\nx = 1\nx\n```\n\nThis is because the do-nothing `displayhook()` call is now always the last statement thanks to the hook registry. This is only a problem with `%pyspark`, but not in `python`. I don't know enough about the internals of the former that would explain the difference, but it might be something we should look into later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258289373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258292148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/320#issuecomment-258292148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/320","id":258292148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODI5MjE0OA==","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T22:23:00Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T22:23:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This looks to be an unique and important feature to have, will be great to have this in Zeppelin\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258292148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/258295842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1590#issuecomment-258295842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1590","id":258295842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODI5NTg0Mg==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T22:41:46Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T22:41:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Got it!
