I need the capability of registering arbitrary timers anytime during processing. For example, for BEAM's trigger:\r\nAfterProcessingTime\r\n        .pastFirstElementInPane()\r\n        .plusDelayOf(Duration.standardMinutes(5)\r\nThis requires registering the trigger after first element shows up in the window pane. On the BEAM side, I am waiting eagerly for this feature to be added so I can push the code.\r\n\r\n- For Samza, this allows the better windowing and trigger. It allows each window to register a different timer, instead of using the GCD hack we currently do (this fix is also requested by @cpettitt-linkedin ). It also allows the time trigger to use a real system timer, instead of approximating it by using the time of incoming message. I believe with this patch it will be straightforward to improve both existing features.\r\n\r\nI think adding the context on the Operator level is inevitable to support timer on the operator level. This should also be needed if we need more context object on the operator level. I can talk to @nickpan47 about this, but I don't think the future refactoring should block current feature development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/365341032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/365369724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/419#issuecomment-365369724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/419","id":365369724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTM2OTcyNA==","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-13T19:03:59Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T19:03:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xinyuiscool Makes sense to implement if this is required for BEAM. If we're adding it to the Samza public API, that's fine too - its certainly a more flexible behavior than the current window implementation. Good point about timer triggers as well.

There may well be other and better ways to address this issue.  I took a minimalist approach which I hoped would reduce the chance of actually making things worse.  \r\n\r\nI briefly considered a more aggressive approach. My thought was to make each thread have its own main loop (and get rid of ThreadJob) and permanently assign each thread one or more partitions to work with.  Basically simulate the individual JVM approach with threads.  Each thread would round robin among the assigned partitions, but, there would be no notion of fairness between threads.  The JVM would do the load sharing between threads much as the OS controlled load sharing between multiple JVMs (each with there own set of partitions) for the single threaded approach.\r\n\r\nI also considered relaxing the notion of fairness between threads by keeping the Chooser full (calling tryUpdate as soon as the previous message was inserted).\r\n\r\nBoth those ideas sounded more like features than bug fixes and would require extensive design, review, and testing.

Thanks a lot for this patch. As you already analyzed very thoroughly, this is a flaw in current AsyncRunLoop that relies on the poll timeout to avoid busy loop, which caused long delays for tasks which have already completed processing. The way of your fix makes sense to me: AsyncRunLoop should use the latch to wait instead of relying on poll timeout.This will allow the other tasks to proceed. Nice work!\r\n\r\nFor the fix implementation, I notice two things:\r\n\r\n1) Did you also configure task.poll.interval.ms to be 0 in order to get rid of the poll waiting? Seems to me it's a must since otherwise the run loop will still poll quite often in case of empty partitions. To this point, looks like we don't need the poll timeout (task.poll.inverval.ms) anymore after this change, since runloop will control the poll interval, and we should immediately return after systemconsumers.poll() in any case. If this is the case, would you mind also make SystemConsumers.poll() always return without waiting?\r\n\r\n2) seems the logic of blockIfNoWork() can be moved into blockIfBusy(), basically doing the same check of null envelope and wait if no worker is available. Is that something feasible?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/373846720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374284557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/436#issuecomment-374284557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/436","id":374284557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDI4NDU1Nw==","user":{"login":"jwlent55","id":835248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTI0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55","html_url":"https://github.com/jwlent55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T16:53:21Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T16:53:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Regarding your questions: \r\n\r\n1) I agree the timeout should never be set to 0. Not sure it should even be configurable. I did so really for testing purposes (so I could modify it without rebuilding my application). I suppose someone might want to tweak it to trade CPU for latency, but, I would be OK with not even making it configurable. The 10 ms value I based it on was not. \r\n\r\n2) I do like the idea of having only one check. Originally I thought that the blockIfNoWork needed to come before the runTasks call, but, that was most likely before I found some race conditions and decided to add the (admittedly somewhat ugly) runLoopResumedSinceLastChecked boolean. Now I think it could be after and therefore the two checks could be combined. That will require a bit of testing (and thought). One other option I originally considered, but, dismissed as a bit risky was to remove the blockIfBusy check. The idea being that eventually if all the task were busy the Chooser would stop finding work and the new check would force a pause. I could not convince myself I understood the code well enough to guarantee that in all cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374284557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374406752","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/436#issuecomment-374406752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/436","id":374406752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDQwNjc1Mg==","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T22:33:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T22:33:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jwlent55 : I think you might misunderstood my first question. Now we have two waits here: one for the poll (task.poll.interval.ms), and the other for no work (task.max.no.work.wait.ms). My question is that since we can now use the second wait to control the polling (if there is no work, don't poll until task.max.no.work.wait.ms), seems we don't need the first wait anymore (equal to set task.poll.interval.ms=0). The AsyncRunLoop was relying on the first poll timer to avoid busy looping, but now it should be fine to return immediately after polling any SystemConsumer. This seems to be the goal we want to achieve here: AsyncRunLoop will control the polling by knowing whether there is worker available to process the message. And this should be much more efficient as you experiments demonstrated. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374406752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374635057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/436#issuecomment-374635057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/436","id":374635057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDYzNTA1Nw==","user":{"login":"jwlent55","id":835248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTI0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55","html_url":"https://github.com/jwlent55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T15:13:49Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T15:13:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"You are correct.  I completely misread your first question.  Without looking at the code I mistook it for a question I already had in my mind and went off into the weeds.  Let me try again.\r\n\r\nI did not set the task.poll.interval.ms to 0 (which is used to set \"pollIntervalMs\").  I left it at its default 50 ms.  I think it is still necessary to ensure that if some partitions have exhausted the their \"unprocessedMessagesBySSP\", but, others are keeping up with main loop Chooser (so that it always finds new work to process) that the main loop will still occasionally (every 50 ms) check to see if the currently empty partitions have new messages to \"drain\" from the bufferedMessages queue.  This call should not block if the \"timeout\" variable is set to zero (when it is 0 this \"poll\" is really just a \"drainTo\").  My proposed update includes logic to ensure that timeout value is always set to 0 if we are not planning to update the Chooser during the call to choose (i.e., in the AsyncRunLoop case).  I think this same logic stops the blocking/polling both in the \"no work\" case and in the \"long time (50 ms) since last poll\" case.\r\n\r\nOn a related note when I first started working on this issue I thought the problem might be in the \r\nBlockingEnvelopeMap.poll method.  I noted that it would block on the first SSP that did not have any messages (if the timeout was greater than zero) even if other empty partitions had messages ready to \"drain\".  I reorganized the logic so it first \"drained\" all the queues and only then if it could not find at least one message to process start \"polling\" the SSPs one by one (and most likely blocking on the first one). That did not address my issue so I did not include that logic in my change.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374635057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/374636467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/436#issuecomment-374636467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/436","id":374636467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDYzNjQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"jwlent55","id":835248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTI0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55","html_url":"https://github.com/jwlent55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwlent55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T15:17:45Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T15:17:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"While investigating your question I noted that I had not included documentation for my new parameter in the configuration-table.html file.
