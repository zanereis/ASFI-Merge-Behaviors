The next option to fix PersistentPartitionedRegionRegressionTest is to bounce the DUnit VM instead of invoking Cache.close() within the callback where it's being called. Dan and I then decided it was best to disable JMX MBeans for the test because test doesn't need MBeans and this will prevent the test from hanging. The underlying deadlock would still need to be fixed but at least precheckin would not hang. I do not have time to do any further work on this.

not sure if there are stats that have legitimately negative values or not. I can't think of any but there might be some. \r\n\r\nIf we change the underlying stats framework to not allow negative values, we have two possible approaches: 1) have the code throw if a call attempts to drop the value below zero, 2) have the code ignore and decrements when the value is at zero.\r\n\r\nFor #1, I'm worried that we would create new failures that would bring down servers when the stats used to go negative.\r\n\r\nFor #2, I'm a little worried that we would suppress our ability to notice that code decrementing a stat is buggy. I don't think we want to log every time we try to dec below zero to avoid suppressing this.\r\n\r\nA bigger problem that Michael and I noticed is that there's no type enforcement. In other words if the stat is defined as a LongCounter but some code incs or decs it as an Integer, nothing complains or fails. The ThreadLocal used for striping values has two arrays: one for long values and one for integer values. No matter which Counter type, incInt or incLong will happily update the value in corresponding array. So if a stat has some bug in which most of the code paths invoke incLong but one path still invokes incInt, it'll fail to update the proper underlying array and the call to incInt is affectively ignored for the stat. The reason this isn't easy to fix is that there's a single class (Atomic50StatisticsImpl) for all stats in a given *Stats class which may contain a mix of both long and integer stats. I think fixing this problem would be a lot of work redoing the stats framework.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would be better to start migrating ALL stats implementations to using Micrometer instead of reworking our existing framework. (both for dec'ing stats below zero and long vs integer type safety)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/459809269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/459817035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3142#issuecomment-459817035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3142","id":459817035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTgxNzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T18:17:12Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T18:17:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay.

We have identified a small number of meters add to geode-core very soon. The goal of this PR is to get the system in place to do that.\r\n\r\nThe API is temporarily internal in case we want to tweak it before moving it to a non-internal place. Specifically, we intend to make the MeterCollector interface and the method to obtain one externally available. We considered putting getMetricsCollector() in DistributedSystem and marking it experimental, but one of the questions yet to be decided is whether DistributedSystem is the right place to expose the metrics system.\r\n\r\nWe intend to expose the CompositeMeterRegistry only as a MeterRegistry, to allow us to substitute other implementations later if we choose. The MeterRegistry (abstract class) is all that’s needed to create meters.\r\n\r\nThe CompositeMetricsCollector allows us to move the configuration of the CompositeMeterRegistry out of InternalDistributedSystem, which doesn’t need yet more responsibilities. (Though, uh, in the code I submitted, the configuration is done in InternalDistributedSystem. That should be moved into CompositeMetricsCollector.)\r\n\r\nMetricsCollector  (the primary hub for accessing the metrics system) is an interface in order to allow us to substitute other implementations later, and make it easier to test things that don’t need the concrete implementation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your review. Have I left you more puzzled? Less puzzled? Differently puzzled?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/459922727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/459959009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3156#issuecomment-459959009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3156","id":459959009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk1OTAwOQ==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T11:51:20Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T11:51:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@onichols-pivotal @Petahhh ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/459959009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/460130049","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3153#issuecomment-460130049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3153","id":460130049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDEzMDA0OQ==","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-04T04:47:41Z","updated_at":"2019-02-04T04:47:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Dale,\r\n\r\nThat helps.
