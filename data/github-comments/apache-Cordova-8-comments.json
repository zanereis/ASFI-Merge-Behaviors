AB testing both versions in your reproduction app shows the event leads to `platform-browser.js:395` (angular framework code) \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naddEventListener(element, eventName, handler) {\r\n    const plugin = this._findPluginFor(eventName);\r\n    return plugin.addEventListener(element, eventName, handler);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhere on non-cordova, `plugin.addEventListener` method points to the function defined to `zone-evergreen.js` posted above,\r\n\r\nand on Cordova, the function points to https://github.com/apache/cordova-browser/blob/3b077ad590adc6f53a93b8af98efb20f8b1caeb7/cordova-lib/cordova.js#L123\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndocument.addEventListener = function (evt, handler, capture) {\r\n    var e = evt.toLowerCase();\r\n    if (typeof documentEventHandlers[e] !== 'undefined') {\r\n        documentEventHandlers[e].subscribe(handler);\r\n    } else {\r\n        m_document_addEventListener.call(document, evt, handler, capture);\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, Cordova overrides the addEventListener method to handle some cordova-specific events, such as `deviceready`, `pause`, `resume`, and `activated`. Cordova **will** fallback to the original implementation of `addEventListener` if the incoming event isn't a cordova-defined event. However, unfortunately that original implementation is a reference to the native `addEventListener` and not Angular's/Zone replacement implementation.\r\n\r\nBasically this means angular never receives events such as `mousemove`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I see this as bad practice on both sides, no one should be touching/replacing native functions. This case is a prime example of the why. But obviously these are decisions well baked into both frameworks and is incredibly hard to change without virtually breaking every single project using the framework. This means Angular and Cordova doesn't really support each other (in a nice way, see the workaround).\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nI tried moving the `cordova.js` script tag so it's loaded after the angular framework. I also had to remove the `defer` attribute on the angular script tags to ensure that are loaded and executed first. This will make Cordova store a reference to the modified `addEventListener` interface rather than the browser's native function. This appears to work but mileage may vary. I'm not sure if this will break anything else, but I don't see deviceready not invoked 5 second warning, so *that's a good sign*.\r\n\r\nBecause I don't believe Cordova will change anything in relation to this, I'll be closing this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/704659502/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/715545708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/251#issuecomment-715545708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/251","id":715545708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTU0NTcwOA==","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-23T19:37:33Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T19:37:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

We always have inherited this requirement from the Android tooling. While it seems that it might finally be possible to use a newer JDK with Android tooling, there's a lot to watch out for with your setup and there would still be changes to be made to cordova-android. We probably will get there eventually, but it is just not a top priority right now.\r\n\r\nI do not think we want to introduce a command line option to set the JDK. There is a simple workaround: setting `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables. In POSIX shells (e.g. Git Bash) this could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=C:/oldJava/jdk8\r\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Windows `cmd` (untested):\r\n```\r\nset JAVA_HOME=C:/oldJava/jdk8\r\nset PATH=%JAVA_HOME%/bin;%PATH%\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, all commands in this shell session will use the updated environment variables. So you can just use `cordova run android`. You can also change environment variables per command. The complexity of that varies depending on your shell.\r\n\r\nOn Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, …) you can nicely automate this process using [direnv](https://direnv.net/). I just put above commands inside a `.envrc` file in the projects that use `cordova-android` and `direnv` applies the changes to the environment variables whenever I change into that directory.\r\n\r\nOf course you can also write a little helper script named `usejdk8` that changes the environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/821971872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/821998586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/284#issuecomment-821998586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/284","id":821998586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTk5ODU4Ng==","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-18T14:16:41Z","updated_at":"2021-04-18T14:16:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just wanted to note that current AS alpha preview uses java 11, so soon.... we will be able to upgrade to java 11.

I think it will likely be difficult to support both android and harmony without causing breakage to one environment or another which is why a separate platform I think would be best.\r\n\r\nTo solve plugin support issue, it can do something similar to what the electron platform did, which is to find/use electron implementations first and fallback to a browser implementation of the plugin. For this new Harmony platform, I imagine most \"android\" plugins would work as-is on HarmonyOS but this allows plugin developers to provide a harmony OS alternative implementation of their plugin if necessary.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Apache Cordova project only has a few dedicated members that are active and most of our volunteer time is being spent on maintaining existing Cordova tooling and platforms. Therefore unless if one of our current members have a requirement of supporting HarmonyOS, I don't expect much movement on Apache's side. We've been working on reducing our maintenance load by deprecating platforms. This doesn't mean our community won't support efforts on building a solution for Harmony. If you have any questions, our community [Slack](http://slack.cordova.io/) channel is a great place to ask.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/959026270/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/971568171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/121#issuecomment-971568171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/121","id":971568171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc456PQr","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T13:13:30Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T13:13:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this issue as obsolete.

You can mark that context to be kept alive and store the reference to that `CallbackContext` so that you can continously fire events back to the webview using the same `CallbackContext` instance.\r\n\r\nThe [cordova-plugin-device-motion](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion) is a fairly simple plugin that utilises this strategy.\r\n\r\nYou can see [here](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion/blob/master/src/android/AccelListener.java#L103) on the \"start\" call, the plugin stores a reference of the `CallbackContext`, which is marked as kept [here](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion/blob/master/src/android/AccelListener.java#L120) via `setKeepCallback(true)`. Finally, when the sensor fires a native update, that `CallbackContext` is reused to send data to the webview [here](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion/blob/master/src/android/AccelListener.java#L293).\r\n\r\nNote that the application doesn't need to explicitly hook up this callback context. The plugin itself could listen to the `deviceready` event and make a native call implicitly to hook up the callback context, if that makes more sense for your particular plugin.\r\n\r\nWe use github issues for tracking issues, and because this doesn't sound like a bug I'll be closing this ticket. I hope the above explains well enough on how to reuse the callback context.
