And I argue that those changes are also very easy to revert. For that we need only to leverage the version control system. It is easy to track the changes of a given file, and recover it's previous states.\nMay I recommend that you remove the commented out code, since we still keep the possibility to easily revert those changes in the future?\n\nRegarding the automated testing, I'm very happy to hear that you are working on integration test. I assume from your answer that those integration tests are not committed in the git repository, and that is something I would expect to see happen. Please do correct me if my assumption is wrong.\n\nI trust you when you say that \"there is essentially no existing test code\" covering the code you changed. I wouldn't go as far as to call that fortunate. I actually think it is a very sad truth.\nI think we should unit-test as much as we can, and especially targeting code that has no coverage at all.\nI'm sure that given the amount of changes made in this PR there is ample room for covering at least some of it with unit-tests.\n\nFact is, that if we continue to add code without the complementary unit-tests, our test coverage drops. Is that something we want?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140077337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140079061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/795#issuecomment-140079061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/795","id":140079061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDA3OTA2MQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-14T13:42:56Z","updated_at":"2015-09-14T13:42:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats

 I have the following questions:\n1. I understand there are multiple classes implementing the functionality, but I am still confused as to why the quota plugin can't use the existing SMTP global configuration information.  Under what circumstances would a user have a separate SMTP server for quota alerts?\n2. Through out the DAO code, `Exception` is caught and an error message is logged without including the stack trace (e.g. [QuotaDaoAccountImpl](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/768/files#diff-da03eefbc2970f2296799d2e04992a77R91), [QuotaBalanceDaoImpl](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/768/files#diff-5984af46ebc11f2c8367900351e72b4aR193), [QuotaCreditsDaoImp](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/768/files#diff-56f0f07903a3f744b64fcbb01a5ba2aaR82)).  Why are we so broadly catching checked and unchecked exceptions?  Also, when throwing `CloudRuntimeException` to handle these exceptions, the root cause is not being passed into the constructor -- swallowing critical diagnostic information.\n3.  Some of the transaction blocks in the DAO layer log an error in addition to throwing a `CloudRuntimeException` and others do not.

Here goes an explanation in a timeline manner, so you can get a better understanding of everything that happened:\n\nWhen I assigned that “task” to an intern (@pedro-martins), he executed it going class by class literally (I have to give credits for him to be so calm and controlled, I would not stand to do that). While doing that he noted down classes that he was changing the code. When he pushed, @DaanHoogland pointed out that the PR was adding more lines then removing due to code formatting. Therefore, he created a script that was fed with that list of classes and performed the changes (deleted the lines that had to be deleted and changed the variable names that had to be changed). Another problem arose, for some reason in a few classes such as “VMwareGuru” there are static methods that do not need to be static and that use the “logger” variable, with our PR that had to be changed. He was supposed to find each of the classes that had a problem from that “ComponentLifecycleBase” hierarchic and fix it. Sadly, he missed one class out of 380. We indeed tried to build the whole project with a maven install, but it did not work at that time, there was a problem with a class that we have not touched. \n\nAfter that the PR 714 was merged by @DaanHoogland, and then reverted by @karuturi.\n\nWhen I noticed that problem, I got the task and created a script that really builds the whole “ComponentLifecycleBase” hierarchic and executes the deletes and changes on variable names that are needed. Then I manually check the classes that have some problem, around 8 classes that have static methods that do not need to be static. I created a new PR #778 for that, because we did not find a way to re-open the PR #714. The first time I pushed to PR 778 I successfully did a maven install on ACS to check for compilation problems that might be caused by our change. Then the time passed on (conflicts appeared) and I did another two rebases, the first one I hit a problem with a missing class on “cloud-plugin-network-vcs”  and the last one another missing class on “cloud-framework-db”.\n\nI had sent an email asking about the first missing class I found, but got no answers.\n\nNow to answer your first question, I indeed created a script, but just after the PR 714 was reverted (we were not kidding about that). Moreover, the pushes I did to PR 778 I made sure to execute a maven run to build the project and see if everything was ok. Sadly I hit other problems with missing classes. \n\nSadly during PR 714, we had problems with Travis build timeouts at the same time that we were working on PR 714, if Travis CI was working properly we would have spotted the problem and the PR 714 would not need to be reverted.\n\n@wilderrodrigues now your last point, we indeed have a production and test environments running ACS 4.3.2 (both the same version because we are extending ACS, everything we build is added into our 4.3.2, tested and then pushed to our production environment), that is why we are not building the components changed and testing it here. We did not see a reason to add this PR was not also added to 4.3.2. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140379362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/140380153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/778#issuecomment-140380153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/778","id":140380153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDM4MDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T12:59:14Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T13:00:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wilderrodrigues thanks for your comments, I have just answered your comments on PR 714.
