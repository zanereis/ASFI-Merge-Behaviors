With this I can split a source by its partition count by default and each partition will be a split. This is how Samza itself works today by default, so it's consistent with the current model. Seems right now I don't see such metadata being exposed in the general UnboundedSource/BoundedSource.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4340)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358113633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358117294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4310#issuecomment-358117294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4310","id":358117294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODExNzI5NA==","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T21:44:19Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T21:44:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins: retest this please.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358117294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358119741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4312#issuecomment-358119741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4312","id":358119741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODExOTc0MQ==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T21:52:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T21:52:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.

That loop's role is simply to get Fn API messages and route them to a goroutine for actually handling. It should not be blocking on anything other than waiting on the next message. gRPC requires only one goroutine to be consuming from a stream. This is the receive goroutine, similar to the earlier comments around having a singular goroutine for sends. I'll add a comment to that effect. The goroutine requirements for gRPC are subtle and are inconveniently buried in godoc.\r\n\r\nThe additional parallelism definitely works, as I've verified progress reports show updates of source progress while a bundle was being handled. Without this code, the progress reports don't get seen until the bundle is handled.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that the runner harness controls the parallelism. There's currently no Fn API hook that I'm aware of for the runner to tell the SDK how many threads/goroutines to use. My TODO comments about protection were intended to be an acknowledgement of this point. However, it's not clear to me what value should be used as a throttle. I'm not sure a sync.WaitGroup is the proper concurrency control since each bundle is done based on the work of a single goroutine. I imagine there would be a semaphore representing the number of simultaneous bundles we'd want to handle.  If the goroutine for the bundle can't immediately execute, it blocks on the semaphore. That leaves the network goroutine free to continue to handle control messaging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358137047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/358144993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4419#issuecomment-358144993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4419","id":358144993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODE0NDk5Mw==","user":{"login":"wcn3","id":4626810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4626810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3","html_url":"https://github.com/wcn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T23:40:37Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T23:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"New comments pushed.

This might not be the case.\r\n> Does it make a difference if we try to run the Jenkins test against a Kubernetes cluster running in GKE ?\r\n\r\nThat's right: we need kubectl and kubeconfig present on all jenkins executors given the previous JDBC test runs. Those indeed seems not to be there yet as @chamikaramj  mentioned. Seems that we need to provide all this before we add the jenkins job. By \"all this\", I mean:\r\n\r\n - kubectl, installed on all executors, not only on 'beam1'\r\n - kubernetes cluster instance hosted on GKE\r\n - kubeconfig available on all executors, that allows a connection to the GKE cluster instance. IMO this file shouldn't be in beam's repository as it contains sensitive credentials\r\n - probably it would be convinient to have:  KUBECONFIG environment variable on Jenkins that would point to the config destination\r\n\r\nGiven the kubernetes problems and other jenkins problems (the \"permission denied\" problem mentioned in JIRA [3480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3480)) I decided not to enable the jdbc job again yet (hence new commit, reverting the file change). Still the test can be run manually using io-it-suite/io-it-suite-local profiles on any kubernetes cluster, locally. This is still valueable. Let's add the jenkins job in a separate PR while kubernetes is setup properly on jenkins and jenkins itself works properly.\r\n\r\n@jasonkuster Could you help with setting the proper kubernetes infrastructure?
