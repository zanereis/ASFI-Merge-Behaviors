been encountering the same problem while trying to trace consume status of broadcast messages.\r\nAs is shown in the source code `DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n...\r\nif (MessageModel.CLUSTERING == this.defaultMQPushConsumer.getMessageModel()) {\r\n            commitOffsetValue = this.offsetStore.readOffset(pullRequest.getMessageQueue(), ReadOffsetType.READ_FROM_MEMORY);\r\n            if (commitOffsetValue > 0) {\r\n                commitOffsetEnable = true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n        int sysFlag =

filter\r\n        );\r\n...\r\n```\r\nWhen consumeMode is set to broadcast, commit log is not recorded or submitted to the broker, so you can't find consume status afterward.\r\n\r\nI assume that this is a design failure.\r\n\r\nOriginally offset is recorded by consumer-group in broker, but under broadcast mode, every client within the same consumer-group has it's own offset. And that makes it impossible to record consume status for broadcast message.\r\n\r\nWould @vongosling explain the design and if it is planed to be
