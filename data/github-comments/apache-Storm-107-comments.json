\nThanks for voting +1.\n\nBy the way, in my original design, I didn't use timer to update the histograms. Instead, the histograms were updated in `notify()`. However, such a design requires to call `System.currentTimeMills()` every time when `notify()` is called, to determine whether an update to the histograms is needed. `System.currentTimeMills()` is fairly expensive to be called so frequently.

joda-time but we are not shading clj-time.  This means that the clj-time code is being rewritten to point to the shaded joda-time classes, but are left in the original namespace they were in before.  So any end user who wants to use clj-time will get incompatibilities.  We have a few other clojure dependencies that this happened to.  If we really do want to support coljure for end users this feels like a blocker. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612599252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612599254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4880#issuecomment-2612599254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4880","id":2612599254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTkyNTQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T20:37:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:00:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>I marked it as Critical instead of a blocker but I am open to changing it.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612599254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612599262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4880#issuecomment-2612599262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4880","id":2612599262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1OTkyNjI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T21:30:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:00:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mgaare\">mgaare</a>:</i>\n<p>Some of clj-time works, however.
