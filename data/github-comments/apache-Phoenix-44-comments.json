It runs every minute and looks for any tasks to execute. In the jenkins run, the SYSTEM.TASK query coincided with the new test and caused the failure. I had two questions about this:\r\n1. Unrelated to the test failure but for the design, do you think we should never replace System tables from ServerMetadataCache ?\r\n2. Should we exclude System tables from these new metrics or should I create separate metrics for tracking validateDDL requests and cache hit/miss for system tables? \r\n\r\nEdit - Tried the test with task region observer disabled and it passes.
