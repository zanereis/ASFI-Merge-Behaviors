think we should consider moving this example project to the `tamaya-extensions` repository. This particular example depends on `org.apache.tamaya.ext/tamaya-injection-api` (among others). Even if those dependencies are addressed, imagine what would happen during a release (e.g. 0.4.0): one would first need to `mvn install -pl '!:tamaya-example-distributed'` on the core repository, then `mvn install` on the extensions repository and only _then_ can one run `mvn verify` (i.e. with this example) on the core repository.\r\n\r\nMoving this to `tamaya-extensions` would eliminate the
