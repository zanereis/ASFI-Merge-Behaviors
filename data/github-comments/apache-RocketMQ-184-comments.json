Change rmq and add a scheduled task. Because the client changes on the mqtt side cannot be sensed, the lmq-related ones can only be removed mindlessly on a scheduled basis\r\n> 2. Change mqtt. When the client goes offline and disconnects, notify the broker to remove it (recommended)\r\n\r\nI also think the second option is better. It may be necessary to adapt the new interface to clean up the resources of the lmq queue, or directly implement it in the deleteTopic and deleteSubscriptionGroup methods.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2316624053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2316661332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8597#issuecomment-2316661332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8597","id":2316661332,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86KFXJU","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-29T03:51:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T08:17:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/rocketmq/pull/8597?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Project coverage is 47.18%.
