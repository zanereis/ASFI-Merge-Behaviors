be on the safe side I'd suggest to introduce `Wicket.Event.requestSubmit(f)` function that checks for availability and uses it or falls back to the current code if not available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1772517884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1772891721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/682#issuecomment-1772891721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/682","id":1772891721,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM5prC5J","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T14:52:35Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T14:52:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/master/annotationeventdispatcher-parent\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1772891721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1773386608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/682#issuecomment-1773386608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/682","id":1773386608,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM5ps7tw","user":{"login":"reiern70","id":462655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/462655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70","html_url":"https://github.com/reiern70","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T20:59:21Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T20:59:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/master/annotationeventdispatcher-parent\r\n\r\n@martin-g I'm aware of that work. This PR is 2 things\r\n\r\n1. Make \"default\" event delivery plug-able. This means replacing it by something else (or disabling it)\r\n2. Some simple event annotation based events delivery. Where you can get protected or private or public methods injected with an event, \r\n \r\n```\r\n@OnEvent(XXX.class)\r\nprotected onXXX(IEvent<XXX>  event) {\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows to still work with event and programmatically cancel it.\r\n\r\nor\r\n \r\n```\r\n@OnEvent(XXX.class)\r\nprotected onXXX(XXX  payload) {\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nwill both work. No restrictions on XXX are imposed. \r\n\r\nIMHO, 1. would be nice to have in wicket. As for 2. I can understand can be implemented in many different ways.\r\n\r\n3. This approach does not require a component listener and only marked classes are scanned (by annotation or implementing an interface)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1773386608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1773387451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/682#issuecomment-1773387451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/682","id":1773387451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM5ps767","user":{"login":"reiern70","id":462655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/462655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70","html_url":"https://github.com/reiern70","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reiern70/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T20:59:58Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T20:59:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@martin-g My last commits adds caching","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1773387451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
