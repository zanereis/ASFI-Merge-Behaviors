(See https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.0-alpha/recipes.html#sc_recipes_errorHandlingNote - as well as the Recoverable Errors and the GUID section.)\r\n\r\n`When creating a sequential ephemeral node there is an error case in which the create() succeeds on the server but the server crashes before returning the name of the node to the client. When the client reconnects its session is still valid and, thus, the node is not removed. The implication is that it is difficult for the client to know if its node was created or not. `\r\n\r\nWith this scheme, ZooLock may become independent of sessions - if the session that created the lock expires, then the ephemeral node goes away and without creating a new lock with a new guid there is no way to proceed.  This moves the issue from needing the session id to watching a particular node via a zk path that is unique for each time the lock is created / acquired.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration may be that getting the session id is not thread safe. The getLockId() method is synchronized, but may not want to keep repeatedly asking for the session id.\r\n\r\nIf this seems feasible, I could take a stab and see what it looks like.  Or, I just need to look more and then I would have found out why the is \"a bad

Right, I got that far already. My concern wasn't exactly a question of where to implement it, because I did already track down that code after a significant amount of time. Rather, my concern is in the difficulty in tracking it down itself, as a result of the current design, as well as potential problems with the overall design of this new configuration parsing stuff for compactions.\r\n\r\nThe core of my concern is this: While other uses of configuration properties are fairly easy to track down, because either the enum or their configuration key is directly referenced in other code, that is not the case for these new compaction properties. These configuration properties are utilized in the code only after being carefully parsed by code that is limited in comments and has no direct references to any of the configuration enums or keys themselves (which would make it much easier to search for references and to ensure changes are correctly made in all places the property is used, if a change is needed; aka maintainability). Instead, these enums seem to exist solely for the documentation generator, and are largely disconnected from the implementation. This somewhat undermines the point of the enum container for configuration properties, as the enums exist to help avoid bugs that can be introduced due to implementation code that diverges from the documentation. I also think that the complexity, while I admire the JSON-based solution you designed, is partially to blame for the unexpected behavior at the core of this ticket. And, I suspect this ticket won't be the last of its kind pertaining to these properties if we do not adequately address it sooner.\r\n\r\nSo, I realize that's a fairly critical view of your code... probably coming across more critical than I intend (sorry, if that's the case). But that's why I was hoping to have a live chat... to see if we can come up with something that alleviates my concerns without undermining the intent of your design. I can, of course, bake in a fix for the narrow issue identified in this ticket, but I was hoping to discuss the overall approach. With a better overall approach, I'd have more confidence in a fix for this issue. As it stands, without being certain of everywhere in the code where these properties are used (and it being hard to find them), I'd have a low degree of confidence in the overall correctness of any fix (for this issue, and any others with regard to these configuration properties). Testing can help, but being able to follow the code with a better overall more readable/maintainable design, would also help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/672396552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/672396920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1675#issuecomment-672396920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1675","id":672396920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjM5NjkyMA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T00:35:46Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T00:35:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FWIW,

The configuration design pattern is not something new, it follows a precedent set by many other Accumulo configuration properties that need to allow a user to configure one or more of something.  For other examples see `Property.TABLE_CONSTRAINT_PREFIX`, `Property.TABLE_ITERATOR_PREFIX`, etc.\r\n\r\n>  Instead, these enums seem to exist solely for the documentation generator, and are largely disconnected from the implementation.\r\n\r\nThe defaults under `Property.TSERV_COMPACTION_SERVICE_PREFIX` will be used to create the default compaction services and are not just for documentation.\r\n\r\n> So, I realize that's a fairly critical view of your code... probably coming across more critical than I intend (sorry, if that's the case).\r\n\r\nI welcome criticism.  You have made this criticism multiple times before.  I think it would be more constructive to offer an alternative solution rather than repeatedly criticize this w/o ever offering an alternative. I am not going to spend time thinking about alternatives because I think what is there is fine.  If someone else came up with an alternative and I thought it was better, I would be the first to say hey lets ditch the old stuff. I would be happy to meet and discuss this further I will try to connect with you on Slack.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/673155182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/673204410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1665#issuecomment-673204410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1665","id":673204410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzIwNDQxMA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-13T02:00:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T02:00:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The configuration design pattern is not something new, it follows a precedent set by many other Accumulo configuration properties \r\n\r\nOkay, I think I see the pattern you were going for now. We actually have two kinds of \"PREFIX\" properties: categorical (like `TABLE_PREFIX`, `INSTANCE_PREFIX`, etc.) for logical grouping, and prefacing (like those you mentioned, as well as others that look like `*.opts.*` or `*.custom.*`) which preface user-defined suffixes. Because these new properties aren't exactly categorical, and aren't exactly prefacing, I had difficulty recognizing what you were going for. However, I think I get it now. Thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nAs for offering an alternative... it is difficult to think of alternatives when one doesn't grasp what is there now. The compaction stuff got added too quickly for me to keep up in the past few months. (That's not to say they got added too quickly, objectively speaking... just that due to circumstances, I hadn't been able to follow it as closely over these last few months as I would have needed to in order to understand it fully.) So, I've been stuck at the 'try-to-understand-what-is-there-now' phase. I believe I now have a better idea of what your intent was, and can try to think of alternatives.\r\n\r\nI actually have some alternative ideas in mind now, but they aren't concrete yet. If I see you in Slack, maybe I can bounce them off you, before they coalesce into a future pull request. A preview of what's swirling in my head right now: more JSON, fewer separate config properties. Even if I don't see you there, I think I have enough understanding now to confidently move forward on this ticket, anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/673204410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/673245207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1665#issuecomment-673245207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1665","id":673245207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzI0NTIwNw==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-13T04:18:00Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T04:18:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

I'd punt this one.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   commons-io:commons-io ..................................... 2.4 -> 2.7\r\n> [INFO]   commons-lang:commons-lang ................................. 2.4 -> 2.6\r\n> [INFO]   commons-logging:commons-logging ......................... 1.1.1 -> 1.2\r\n\r\nSame comment above regarding being careful about `commons-*`.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   jline:jline ......................................... 2.11 -> 3.0.0.M1\r\n\r\nThis one is likely going to break the shell.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   junit:junit ............................................. 4.12 -> 4.13\r\n\r\nThis one will introduce a bunch of warnings, that have already been triaged in the main branch and updated there. It's a test dependency and not important to update here.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   org.apache.commons:commons-jci-core ....................... 1.0 -> 1.1\r\n> [INFO]   org.apache.commons:commons-jci-fam ........................ 1.0 -> 1.1\r\n> [INFO]   org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 ......................... 3.1 -> 3.11\r\n> [INFO]   org.apache.commons:commons-vfs2 ......................... 2.3 -> 2.6.0\r\n\r\nMore commons dependencies to be careful about.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk15on ......................... 1.62 -> 1.66\r\n> [INFO]   org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on ......................... 1.62 -> 1.66\r\n\r\nBouncycastle should be updated whenever we can, but I'm not even sure we still need it in newer JDKs. In any case, I believe this is a test dep, so it's probably fine.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   org.easymock:easymock ................................... 4.0.2 -> 4.2\r\n\r\nYes, if it doesn't break anything or introduce a bunch of warnings. I believe we've already updated the main branch.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http ........ 9.2.26.v20180806 -> 11.0.0.beta1\r\n> [INFO]   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-io .......... 9.2.26.v20180806 -> 11.0.0.beta1\r\n> [INFO]   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-security .... 9.2.26.v20180806 -> 11.0.0.beta1\r\n> [INFO]   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server ...... 9.2.26.v20180806 -> 11.0.0.beta1\r\n> [INFO]   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-servlet ..... 9.2.26.v20180806 -> 11.0.0.beta1\r\n> [INFO]   org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-util ........ 9.2.26.v20180806 -> 11.0.0.beta1\r\n\r\nI believe this is the last jetty that still supported Java 7. Since we now use Java 8 for the 1.10 branch, we can update, but not to a beta, and it won't be easy. All jetty updates seem to have breaking changes. I would pass on these.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   org.gaul:modernizer-maven-annotations ................. 1.8.0 -> 2.1.0\r\n\r\nWe can update any test/build tooling without much risk, so this one is fine to update, as is anything found by `mvn versions:display-plugin-updates`. However, there's diminishing returns on the effort, since we've already gone through a lot of this in the main branch already, and I'm not sure how much benefit there is to updating 1.10 when we're trying to stabilize it.\r\n\r\n> [INFO]   org.powermock:powermock-api-easymock .................. 2.0.2 -> 2.0.7\r\n> [INFO]   org.powermock:powermock-core .......................... 2.0.2 -> 2.0.7\r\n> [INFO]   org.powermock:powermock-module-junit4 ................. 2.0.2 -> 2.0.7\r\n> [INFO]   org.powermock:powermock-reflect ....................... 2.0.2 -> 2.0.7\r\n\r\nTest deps are fair game, but might require code changes.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm in favor of updating plugin versions whenever we can, and test dependencies, too. Other deps need to be considered carefully, especially in maintenance branches where the risk of destabilizing things is greater.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/674185319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/674212050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1685#issuecomment-674212050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1685","id":674212050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDIxMjA1MA==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T18:43:30Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T18:43:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> [INFO] org.apache.commons:commons-vfs2 ......................... 2.3 -> 2.6.0\r\n\r\n@ctubbsii Do you remember if this one that we had to revert because of problems with vfs2?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/674212050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/674215626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1687#issuecomment-674215626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1687","id":674215626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDIxNTYyNg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-14T18:47:58Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T18:47:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Some of this will apply to the 2.1/main branch, because that is currently using commons-io 2.6.

I don't know of any particular ones affecting this one. However, we should probably avoid it, because it depends on Hadoop 3.2.1, and we're still supporting Hadoop 2 in the 1.10 branch. I don't know if this version of vfs2 will work on Hadoop 2, and I don't know if it's worth doing a bunch of tests in 1.10, since we've begun distancing ourselves from vfs in the 2.x/main branch with the deprecation of dynamic class loaders, etc.\r\n\r\nIn short, I would leave this one alone.

I'm working through this in #1688 \r\n\r\nAt the core of the issue, is that we need commons-vfs2, guava, hadoop, and hadoop-minicluster to all be happy across both Hadoop 2 and Hadoop 3 profiles, as long as we support both. We should have more flexibility with Hadoop 3, because it has shaded deps. However, hadoop-minicluster isn't shaded, and requires a specific version of Guava, and changing that makes vfs2 unhappy, and guava needs to mesh with both hadoop-minicluster and vfs2.\r\n\r\nI think ultimately, it comes down to the fact that vfs2 is unhappy with one of the updates here, and that's cascading to the other stuff.

One scenario I was thinking about is if the provided prefix is a subset of a recognized prefix.\r\nFor example, let's say we are given the prefix \"a.b.c\" and \"a.b\" is a recognized prefix. Then it may be more efficient to check for this scenario and only iterate through \"a.b\"'s properties instead of iterating through all the properties. What do you think (if that made sense)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/687922256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/687922386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1701#issuecomment-687922386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1701","id":687922386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzkyMjM4Ng==","user":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-06T22:42:28Z","updated_at":"2020-09-06T22:42:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > One open question is should I be filtering out sensitive properties?\r\n> \r\n> This is for pluggable components, vetted by an admin, and placed on a server's class path.
