Yeah. I don't have problem creating a task that throws exception. The problem is ensuring that the correct execution path is triggered through my unit test. It can be done only when I bring up a fully operational processor, like I do in TestStreamProcessor. I felt it was a tad-bit unnecessary for adding this test at this point. Thanks for your quick review, btw! \r\n\r\n@xinyuiscool Check [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-1084?focusedCommentId=15866556&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15866556) for details. It basically didn't seem like a big value add for the user. I remember this conclusion is different from what we had discussed previously.\r\n> I am not sure whether you plan to add more samza specific stuff to this ProcessorLifecyleCallback interface. \r\n\r\nAs of today, we don't intend to include anything else on this callback. \r\n\r\n> If we just need to know when it's complete and failure, you can use java8 CompletableFuture. You can wire up your single thread executor with that easily (something like this: http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2015/11/which-thread-executes.html)\r\n\r\nThat sounds awesome! I didn't know about this.

We'll add support for more join types and a persistent state store soon.\r\n\r\n1. A default TTL: We decided against adding one in this implementation since it's hard for the framework to make a reasonable guess about the value - it would depend on the memory allocated to the container and the incoming message throughput and size. The plan is to add support for a persistent state store soon, so in the mean time it's probably better to let the users set a value based on their expected usage.\r\n\r\n2. Expiring from relation internal state: In this implementation there's no separate join state, only the internal state for each relation (contained in its \"PartialJoinFunction\"). Join results are emitted as matches are found, and entries are purged from the relation's internal state when they're older than the TTL. There's another possible version where a match causes the entries corresponding to the emitted results to be removed immediately, but we decided to implement this more general version instead.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/283756701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/283764838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/71#issuecomment-283764838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/71","id":283764838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mzc2NDgzOA==","user":{"login":"fredji97","id":1413339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMzMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97","html_url":"https://github.com/fredji97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredji97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T20:07:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T20:07:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, there is another PR#72 for the code change. \nThanks,\nFred\n\n    On Thursday, March 2, 2017 11:17 AM, Navina Ramesh <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n \n\n Is there any code change associated with your JIRA other than the dependency change, @fredji97 ?—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.  \n\n   ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/283764838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/283805924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/60#issuecomment-283805924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/60","id":283805924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzgwNTkyNA==","user":{"login":"renato2099","id":1325916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjU5MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1325916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099","html_url":"https://github.com/renato2099","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T22:39:17Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T22:39:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reply @prateekm ! :)\r\nFor (1) fair enough, it's better to make the user define a proper TTL.\r\nFor (2) I see what you mean.

Here are the roadblocks I have hit :)\r\n\r\n* On a fully synchronous API: ZkJobCoordinator is fully asynchronous ( See PR #70 & PR #50 ) - meaning, streamProcessor.start() simply starts the Zk JobCoordinator - which will participate in the leader election and then, WAIT on notification for the jobmodel to be available. Waiting for the notification is not time-bound and can take very long time , if the processors group is constantly changing. Hence, the creating a blocking call with a timeout may not be a good idea for StreamProcessor user. \r\n(Additionally, ZkJobCoordinator implementation doesn't bind to the contract defined in JobCoordinator interface :( I have created a JIRA to fix this [SAMZA-1147](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-1147) )\r\n\r\n* On the other hand, if we make start/stop asynchronous, we should provide callbacks for the user. I took a stab at adding callbacks for the processor lifecycle - onStart (invoked just before container starts the runloop), onStop (invoked when container has fully stopped) and onError (invoked when container fails/throws an exception). This looks good, however, it does not capture any error that can happen in the Job Coordinator. I am little confused about whether it sufficiently provides the user control over the behavior of the processor. \r\n\r\n* Another point of difference (between pre-Zk and post-Zk world), StreamProcessor managed both jobcoordinator and container. But now, we have refactored it in a way that StreamProcessor manages JobCoordinator, which in turn, controls the container life-cycle. I feel like the latter is not the best approach as it seems to pollute the JobCoordinator interface with StreamProcessor requirements. \r\n\r\nThese are my 2 cents. We can sync-up in-person if it is hard to evaluate the options in the PR.

Our use case is that we have many stores / changelog topics and two typical configurations: simple test deployments with a single Kafka node (and therefore want a single changelog replica) and production (and more complex test) )deployments where we currently configure three replicas.  The system default is two.  Therefore we currently need to explicitly list each of the changelog topic stores in our configuration files or they inadvertently default to two.  Easier for us would be to configure a single changelog replica default and only if necessary configure a store specific one.  In other words our desired number of replicas does not currently vary by store, but, instead by deployment topology.\r\n\r\nI put some of this information in the JIRA, but, failed to copy it into the pull request.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/287342312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/287407730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/70#issuecomment-287407730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/70","id":287407730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzQwNzczMA==","user":{"login":"sborya","id":959768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTc2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/959768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya","html_url":"https://github.com/sborya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sborya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T16:44:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T16:44:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"submitted as a part of another PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/287407730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/287413538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/89#issuecomment-287413538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/89","id":287413538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzQxMzUzOA==","user":{"login":"vjagadish1989","id":18561937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989","html_url":"https://github.com/vjagadish1989","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vjagadish1989/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T17:05:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T17:05:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for pointing out!

We are missing \"state\" definitions for each of the components interacting in StreamProcessor - namely, JobCoordinator and SamzaContainer. This makes it difficult for us to define the state of the StreamProcessor. For now, it merely keeps track of whether JobCoordinator was started or not (JobCoordinator does not provide a way to check status). Making these changes is much larger scope and I hope to tackle it in SAMZA-1147 and SAMZA-1150. \r\n2. Similarly, there is no clear error handling semantics for JobCoordinator. It was straightforward with StandaloneJobCoordinator because JobCoordinator was simply a pass-through. So, we were interested only in failures in SamzaContainer. With the introduction of other JobCoordinator implementations, we need to handle the interaction between JobCoordinator and Container to propagate errors up the stack. With this patch, we propagate only container errors using the callback. With SAMZA-1150, errors from jobcoordinator should also propagate to the user.\r\n\r\nI have kept the above changes in separate JIRAs as it has much larger scope. \r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* Added unit tests for SamzaContainerController \r\n* Added unit tests for StreamProcessor \r\n* Changed stop() api in StreamProcessor to syncStop()\r\n\r\nFyi, there are going to be more changes based on SEP-2's requirements/design. We should align the sync/async behavior of our APIs based on that.
