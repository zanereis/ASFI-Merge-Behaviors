is a git convention of prefixing `fixup!` to commits that are just fixes to the prior commit (comes from the [use of `--autosquash` when rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) but I will do it manually). My impression is that there is only really one commit of changes here. Can you either squash them yourself and `git push -f` or else reword the commits to start with `fixup!`?\n\nAll of this is to just so that I don't have to sort out the right commit message. You can also just reply and let me know that the first commit message is the one you care about and I can squash the rest into that, which is what this looks

this fix solves the problem, I'm wondering about this solution.. Is it OK to have the default sharding of the direct runner random (within range) ? to the best of my knowledge, sharding is related to the nature (and volume)  of the data, so for a word count example of 2 words, you might end-up having 7 output files...\nI guess this depends on how we see the `DirectRunner`, if it's for examples and testing, it's fair enough, but if it's also an out-of-the-box
