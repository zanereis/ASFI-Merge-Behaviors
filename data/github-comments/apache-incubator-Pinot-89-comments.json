I think most of the developpers are using intellij to format the code. Let's try to make the plug-in the same behavior as auto-formatting with intellij\r\n\r\nThe level of difficulty is extremely high:\r\n* Intellj is not an open source project, the formatter it used is built-in, so there is no intelllj-formater maven plugin. Which means we can not use intellj-code-style.xml directly.\r\n* The inability to work out a set of eclipse formatting rules that are equivalent to what we use in IntelliJ basically prevents us from using the eclipse plugin (the one we use in this PR). \r\n* IntelliJ can import eclipse code styles, but translation is not accurate enough, and the opposite direction is not supported. Imtellj can not export formatting rules as eclipse formatting rules neither. So we are unable to generate eclipse rules in an automatic way.\r\n\r\nSo, what we can do is either:\r\n* Keep the import order and unused imports removal check we made in https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6782, but give up the code block auto-formatting. Let engineer manually format the file (github workflow can only detect violation at the imports section, code-block part violation can not be detected).\r\n\r\nOr \r\n\r\n* Forget about the IDE formatting, engineer don't need to manually format the file using IDE, but manually run `mvn spotless:format` to format (github workflow will fail and prompt engineer to run `mvn spotless:format`  if there are any violations). \r\n\r\nOption 2 can force the whole codebase formatted in a consistent way, but not match the intellij auto-formatting behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/821578169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/821585761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/6804#issuecomment-821585761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6804","id":821585761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTU4NTc2MQ==","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-16T22:00:44Z","updated_at":"2021-04-16T22:00:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > > In columnar database world, encoding is commonly referred to column level compression techniques which play nice with columnar query execution - dictionary encoding, RLE, delta where the true benefit is that query processing can happen faster on compressed columnar data (e.g dictionary encoding) and obviously storage saving is there\r\n> > > The purpose of this issue is to not add any new column level encoding.

We should not see almost all files reformatted\r\n\r\nFor \"new line for exception\", in Intellj, it's corresponding option is called \"always wrap throws keyword\":\r\n![Jietu20210416-234504](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12423751/115104530-ee84bd80-9f0d-11eb-816a-c584dec50b81.jpg)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Eclipse formatter does not has such a option, here is a complete list of Eclipse formatter options: https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.core/blob/7e35bbd8b9cc36a449e562c61841f9968ec4bec3/org.eclipse.jdt.core/formatter/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/formatter/DefaultCodeFormatterOptions.java#L122-L524\r\n\r\nFor `new space for array declaration etc`, I have change the codestyle-eclipse.xml file to match IntellJ behavior.\r\n\r\nSo, it's almost impossible to make the maven plugin be consistent with IntellJ behavior if we use eclipse formatter given that IntellJ/Eclipse provide different options. \r\n\r\nIf we wanner keep consistency across IntellJ IDE, Eclipse IDE and maven plugin, the only choice is [the google formatter](https://github.com/google/google-java-format), which has plugin for both IntellJ/Eclipse/Maven.\r\n\r\nThe drawback is:\r\n* the tool enforces [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), which was [praised and recommended by the Oracle Java team as described in the Oracle Java magazine](https://alanzeichick.com/2016/11/wheres-best-java-coding-style-guide-not-oracle.html) though, the tool itself does not allow too much config by design. Copied form\r\ngoogle-java-format project home page:\r\n```\r\nNote: There is no configurability as to the formatter's algorithm for formatting. This is a deliberate design decision to unify \r\nour code formatting on a single format.\r\n```\r\n* The tool will mess up license header, see: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/843. Let's wait for reply from spotless team, it's impossible to be used for pinot if there is no solution/workaround.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/821780315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/821806510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6810#issuecomment-821806510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6810","id":821806510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMTgwNjUxMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-17T11:08:28Z","updated_at":"2021-04-17T11:34:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6810?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#6810](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6810?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (0b02c65) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/commit/b44d4c225544be9d7af1b1bbcd06b46bc1bf8102?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (b44d4c2) will **increase** coverage by `0.05%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6810/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/6810?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #6810      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     73.99%   74.05%   +0.05%     \n  Complexity       12       12              \n============================================\n  Files          1414     1414              \n  Lines         68889    68889              \n  Branches       9942     9942              \n============================================\n+ Hits          50976    51016      +40     \n+ Misses        14577    14547      -30     \n+ Partials       3336     3326      -10     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| integration | `43.68% <100.00%> (+0.11%)` | `7.00 <0.00> (ø)` | |\n| unittests | `65.96% <0.00%> (-0.02%)` | `12.00 <0.00> (ø)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
