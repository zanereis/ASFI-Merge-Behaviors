So whether its written in go/python/etc doesnt necessarily matter since its the current de-facto way of accomplishing this type of job in Kubernetes. If its desired to add a git-sync pod to the specification of your airflow scheduler/web k8s spec file (or helm chart, as we use internally at SpotHero) I actually think the appropriate place for that to live is within the kubernetes spec file as an init container, exactly how you have it defined in the PR you linked to.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm very excited to see the open PR for a helm chart right now. We've discussed open-sourcing our internal chart here but haven't gotten around to doing it yet. For the purposes of this PR we've discussed providing a barebones set of airflow kubernetes config files (deployments for scheduler and web server, services, configmap, etc), but have decided not to pursue the path of helm since not everyone is using it (or can use it). \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in working with us we would welcome the help. You can find us on the Kubernetes slack (#sig-big-data) if you want to chat, and you can also see open issues we're tracking on the [bloomberg/airflow issue tracker](https://github.com/bloomberg/airflow/issues).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/339472412/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/339502099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2414#issuecomment-339502099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2414","id":339502099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTUwMjA5OQ==","user":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T23:13:29Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T23:13:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"HI @Stibbons, great to see kubernetes being attacked from multiple angles :).\r\n\r\nI think that having a Helm Chart/ Airflow controller will be extremely valuable for people who wants to stick with Celery/want to maintain a deployment of static workers.\r\n\r\n@benjigoldberg Is absolutely right that since we're only using the git-sync as an initContainer, that's the best way for you to integrate with your own project.
