So adding Quartz job will fail. That is, the online failed.\r\n> \r\n> **Solution**\r\n> 1 You can adjust the end time period. Just include the next execution time of cron within the start and end time period.\r\n> \r\n> 2 When modifying the timing, set the \"execution time\" button to calculate the next five execution times. If there is data, the timing setting is correct, otherwise there is a problem with the timing setting.\r\n> \r\n> 根据你的截图，你选的时间短是2020-04-27 23:56:00 到 2020-04-27 23:56:02\r\n> cron 表达式为 0 0 * * * ? *,可以判断cron表达式是一小时执行一次。如果按照你的的开始时间，下一次执行执行时间应该是2020-04-28 00:00:00，而你的结束时间段是 2020-04-27 23:56:02 ，小于下一次执行时间。所以添加Quartz job就会失败。也就是上线失败。\r\n> \r\n> **解决办法**\r\n> 1 你可以调整结束时间段。只要要包含cron下一次执行时间在起止时间段内。\r\n> \r\n> 2 在修改定时，单击“执行时间”按钮，可以计算接下来五次执行时间，如果有数据那么定时设置正确，否则定时设置就有问题。\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3055810/80392079-42ebf300-88e1-11ea-897c-7043dae65caa.png)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a bug and will be updated in a later release to address this issue.\r\n\r\nIf I only want to do it once at a certain point in time, this setup is a bit repetitive（不确定这是否属于bug，后续版本是否会针对这个问题进行更新。\r\n如果我只想在某一时间点执行一次，这设置就有点重复了）","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/620485393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/620499008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/2555#issuecomment-620499008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/2555","id":620499008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDQ5OTAwOA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T09:46:08Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T09:47:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2555](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555?src=pr&el=desc) into [dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/commit/fd79be39a936027bdfe7ab43ae9b9606605c5f69&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=bv9iXXRLi9)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##                dev    #2555      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     35.96%   35.95%   -0.02%     \n- Complexity     2409     2410       +1     \n============================================\n  Files           424      424              \n  Lines         19601    19601              \n  Branches       2390     2390              \n============================================\n- Hits           7049     7047       -2     \n- Misses        11926    11928       +2     \n  Partials        626      626              \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [...he/dolphinscheduler/common/thread/ThreadUtils.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZG9scGhpbnNjaGVkdWxlci1jb21tb24vc3JjL21haW4vamF2YS9vcmcvYXBhY2hlL2RvbHBoaW5zY2hlZHVsZXIvY29tbW9uL3RocmVhZC9UaHJlYWRVdGlscy5qYXZh) | `68.25% <0.00%> (-9.53%)` | `13.00% <0.00%> (-1.00%)` | |\n| [...e/dolphinscheduler/remote/NettyRemotingClient.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZG9scGhpbnNjaGVkdWxlci1yZW1vdGUvc3JjL21haW4vamF2YS9vcmcvYXBhY2hlL2RvbHBoaW5zY2hlZHVsZXIvcmVtb3RlL05ldHR5UmVtb3RpbmdDbGllbnQuamF2YQ==) | `53.95% <0.00%> (+2.87%)` | `11.00% <0.00%> (+2.00%)` | |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dolphinscheduler/pull/2555?src=pr&el=footer).

when you sovled this issue, please tell us how to solve ,thx\r\n\r\nAfter communicating with the user, it was found that the user started the service. Start the installation package path start-all.sh first, followed by the help of several small partners, the user updated the installation path dolphinscheduler_env.sh, the user restarts and starts the installation package path start-all.sh.\r\nSo let the user stop killing all services first, then start start-all.sh in the installation path and run python ok;\r\nA problem exposed here is that the documentation is not comprehensive enough. Can also be optimized\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n和用户交流后发现是用户启动服务的问题。最先启动**安装包路径**start-all.sh,后续几个小伙伴的帮助，用户更新了**部署路径**下dolphinscheduler_env.sh，用户重启还是启动安装包路径下start-all.sh。\r\n所以让用户先停了kill所有服务，然后启动部署路径下start-all.sh，运行python ok 了；\r\n这里暴露一个问题是文档写的还不够全面。还可以优化\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/620520351/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/620526105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/2541#issuecomment-620526105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/2541","id":620526105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDUyNjEwNQ==","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T10:38:17Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T10:38:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos,
