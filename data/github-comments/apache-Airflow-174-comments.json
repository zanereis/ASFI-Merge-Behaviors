There are no tests for presto at all in the project. By the project's own guidelines this hook should be moved to contrib. I'd argue it's mostly useless in it's current state as anyone deploying presto in production would have authentication enabled. I do not have the time to set up a full test environment inside travis for presto to get my small patch merged enabling authentication. If it were simply a matter of extending some existing presto tests, no problem.

Using `skipIf` to check what python version is present should be enough. And maybe we should do the same with [test_python_2 and test_python_2.7](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/6a7f3887460c91bc4da90fe8d31836a225324a1a/tests/operators/test_virtualenv_operator.py#L124)\r\n- [tests.operators.test_virtualenv_operator.test_string_args](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/6a7f3887460c91bc4da90fe8d31836a225324a1a/tests/operators/test_virtualenv_operator.py#L170) is a weird test. It uses a method called `_invert_python_major_version()` to use the opposite version to the one available, which is causing problems with [python2 tests](https://travis-ci.com/gerardo/incubator-airflow/jobs/157826745#L4503). Do you guys understand this test?\r\n- There was a change between `python3.5` and `python3.6` in the error message emitted when an object is not serializable ([logs](https://travis-ci.com/gerardo/incubator-airflow/jobs/157826750#L4568)). It's just a matter of changing the test to check for the new message format.\r\n- One of the tz tests is failing as well, more specifically, `test_following_previous_schedule_daily_dag_CEST_to_CET` ([logs](https://travis-ci.com/gerardo/incubator-airflow/jobs/157826750#L4367)). I'm not sure where to start. It seems to happen only with `python3.6`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/438530066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/438566820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1964#issuecomment-438566820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1964","id":438566820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODU2NjgyMA==","user":{"login":"ron819","id":40163787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTYzNzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40163787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819","html_url":"https://github.com/ron819","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron819/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-14T07:38:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T07:38:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@duffn

Why you cannot do try catch in code there you use this hook? I don't think what it's correct 'silence' errors from external APIs in hooks, because it's not operators and this method is get_dataset, not check exist or not - it's return dataset_info. But I'm syre what it's incorrect copy-paste full code just for except code == 404 - it could be done anythere there you call this code.
