Modify the `7.FAQ` in the document to `7.Others`, the original `FAQ` chapter is sunk to `7.1.FAQ`;\r\n> 2. Add directory `7.2.API Change History`;\r\n> 3. Migrate the API change history from the `4.User Manual` to the newly added `7.2.API Change History` directory, and check whether the content of the document is correct during the process;\r\n> 4. Add configuration change history of the ShardingSphere-Proxy;\r\n> 5. unify terminologies, such as `Replica query` and `Readwrite split`,  should be changed to `Readwrite splitting`.\r\n> \r\n> The adjusted directory level is as follows:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ├── 6.Downloads\r\n> └── 7.Others\r\n>     ├── 7.1.FAQ\r\n>     └── 7.2.API Change History\r\n>     \t├── 7.2.1.ShardingSphere-JDBC\r\n>

7.2.2.ShardingSphere-Proxy\r\n>         ...\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **Notice: ShardingSphere documentation contains English and Chinese versions, which will be processed separately.**\r\n> \r\n> Current
