You current understanding of the change is no completely correct.\n\n> The default timestamp extractor and the new timestamp extractor differ only in whether or not they are logging a WARN message when a message has an invalid timestamp.\n\nThe default TS extractor raises an exception, thus, killing the running instance, while the new TS extractor just logs a WARN message.\n\nI furthermore do understand your argument about splitting extractor and handler. However, from a user point of view, assume a user wants to react on corrupted records and also does provides a custom TS extractor (ie, not using default extractor). First, user must understand that if no valid TS can be extracted, `-1` must be returned, and this will later on trigger a call to an additional error handler she must also provide. In this handler, the handling of the corrupted record will happen. So why not just handle the corrupted record directly in the extractor... that would be way more straight forward.\n\nAbout local knowledge etc. If Streams policy is to silently drop records with invalid/negative timestamps, the extractor will know whats gonna happening.

The close also needs to have a timeout as people will have different requirements on how long they are willing to wait. Obviously forever is bad, but 1 minute might be deemed bad in certain cases. Also, of course, you need to be able to terminate the app from the exception handler - i guess that could be done as you suggest, but it would probably be nicer from an API/user point of view to not have to poll on the state of the `KafkaStreams` instance.

But `Converter` interface does not require (via its documentation) for its implementations to be thread-safe. Thus, we need to change either the docs or apply the changes described here (whatever we prefer)\n\nAs a side note, interestingly enough BinaryEncode instances in avro are not thread-safe. There isn't an issue because in `AvroConverter`, from what I can see briefly, because we don't reuse them (we instantiate a new one instead), but that's a difference I see from `jackson`'s object mappers. Thus we might want to be extra cautious about how the `Converter` interface is used. \n\nLet me know what you prefer between documentation change in Converter interface or the above changes.
