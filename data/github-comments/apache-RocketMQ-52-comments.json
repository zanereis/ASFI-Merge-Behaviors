Does this bug apply to all topics or just the dead letter topic ?\r\n\r\nBecause I noticed when the scheduled service clears commitLogs periodically, it will actually update the minOffset in

Curious how duplicationEnabled would affect the ReputMessageService, I noticed \r\n```\r\n private void doReput() {\r\n            if (this.reputFromOffset < DefaultMessageStore.this.commitLog.getMinOffset()) {\r\n                this.reputFromOffset = DefaultMessageStore.this.commitLog.getMinOffset();\r\n            }\r\n            for (boolean doNext = true; this.isCommitLogAvailable() && doNext; ) {\r\n\r\n                if (DefaultMessageStore.this.getMessageStoreConfig().isDuplicationEnable()\r\n                    && this.reputFromOffset >= DefaultMessageStore.this.getConfirmOffset()) {\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what the confirmOffset means (seems like minimum checkpoint timestamp ), but with my understanding about the correct impl of commit log recovery, it seems we need to change doReput() as well. \r\n\r\nmaybe something like \r\n```\r\n                if (!DefaultMessageStore.this.getMessageStoreConfig().isDuplicationEnable()\r\n                    && this.reputFromOffset < DefaultMessageStore.this.getConfirmOffset()) {\r\n                    increase reputFromOffset and continue;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks so much and would it would be great if we can document what the confirmOffset really means and what should be the desired duplicationEnabled semantics.\r\n\r\n\r\nreference: http://zjykzk.github.io/post/cs/rocketmq/store/

Actually this is found in resetOffset():\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public boolean resetOffset(long offset) {\r\n        MappedFile mappedFileLast = getLastMappedFile();\r\n\r\n        if (mappedFileLast != null) {\r\n            long lastOffset = mappedFileLast.getFileFromOffset() +\r\n                mappedFileLast.getWrotePosition();\r\n            long diff = lastOffset - offset;\r\n\r\n            final int maxDiff = this.mappedFileSize * 2;\r\n            if (diff > maxDiff)\r\n                return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ListIterator<MappedFile> iterator = this.mappedFiles.listIterator();\r\n\r\n        while (iterator.hasPrevious()) {\r\n            mappedFileLast = iterator.previous();\r\n            if (offset >= mappedFileLast.getFileFromOffset()) {\r\n                int where = (int) (offset % mappedFileLast.getFileSize());\r\n                mappedFileLast.setFlushedPosition(where);\r\n                mappedFileLast.setWrotePosition(where);\r\n                mappedFileLast.setCommittedPosition(where);\r\n                break;\r\n            } else {\r\n                iterator.remove();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I saws  deleteLastFile()  actually deleted the file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public void deleteLastMappedFile() {\r\n        MappedFile lastMappedFile = getLastMappedFile();\r\n        if (lastMappedFile != null) {\r\n            lastMappedFile.destroy(1000);\r\n            this.mappedFiles.remove(lastMappedFile);\r\n            log.info(\"on recover, destroy a logic mapped file \" + lastMappedFile.getFileName());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it appears to me that when we remove a mappedFile from `this.mappedFiles`，we actually want to delete the underlying file as well. I thought if we use `iterator.remove()` without deleting the file, we lose the reference to that file as well. (because this.mappedFiles are supposed to hold the )\r\n\r\nOtherwise it might be that we don't need to call `iterator.remove()`, because I saw Java 8 doc\r\n\r\n> (For CopyOnWriteArrayList iterators, in our case this.mappedFiles )Mutation operations on iterators (remove, set, and add) are not supported. These methods throw UnsupportedOperationException. (which is a runtime exception)\r\n\r\nWhich seems weird to me. If that's true then the `iterator.remove()` is not working at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/632930718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/632945736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1981#issuecomment-632945736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1981","id":632945736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjk0NTczNg==","user":{"login":"lebron374","id":5032169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzIxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5032169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374","html_url":"https://github.com/lebron374","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lebron374/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-22T23:46:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-22T23:46:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
