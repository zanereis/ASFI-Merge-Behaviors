We did not consider the `timestamp_format` in Druid side at the first place. Now `DruidDatasource` will not have `timestamp_format` column and before accessing the `datasource.timestamp_format` in viz.py, it will check the type of datasource first and only access it when the type is `table`.\nWe still keep the `timestamp_format` as a table property because each table mostly has only one column as datetime column (users can choose that column in List Table Column) and that `timestamp_format` will only apply for that chosen column. If a different column with different datetime is chosen, then a new timestamp format should be specified.\nWe also remove the try catch in migration. It is a leftover when we are testing. :S\nThank you. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/223398836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/223399225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/555#issuecomment-223399225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/555","id":223399225,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzM5OTIyNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T19:38:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T19:38:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I like the idea of improving the error messages but we should allow for both custom message and this introspection of the web response.

Are you thinking about the actual \"metric\" names? You can redefine what the Metric names are in the table editing screen. \n\nSo you could take \"sum\" and name it via the Metric name you even have control over the expression that is grouped, so you could do \"sum(somefield) and name it \"sum_field\" there. \n\nWhat I am looking to do with this issue is for fields that just don't \"look\" pretty (the 1 -> Female, 2 -> Male example) or Lets say you have a field that is an abbreviation for departments in your company:\n\nHR -> Human Resources\nAcct -> Accounting\nOp -> Operations\nIT -> Information Technology\n\nFor columns or for metrics, you could attach a \"lookup\" table that any time the values were displayed, Caravel would try a simple replacement if value to be displayed = \"lookup value\" than instead replace the value.  \n\nThis would have no impact on the SQL, and you wouldn't be able to change how the visualizations compute things, this would be on the labels only.  Additionally, we should probably limit the size of the tables to say \"50\" for performance reasons. If you have more that 50 values, it would be tedious to create the lookup tables, and you may be better off with a join, I am talking about presentation layer only for this request.  The idea being in the case of the Abbreviations, I could show the vis on a dashboard as is, but if I want it to look really good, then I can alter the final output and get that 100% I am looking for. \n\n(Also: If no lookup value if found, obviously default to the real value)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/223562476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/223590500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/557#issuecomment-223590500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/557","id":223590500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzU5MDUwMA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T14:16:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T14:16:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage

The 0 > 18 references to the scalelevel in this domain. The Y axis refers to a simple count.\n\nYou said that you create a extremely small order by metric as the first metric. If i'd add a small order by in the series, i'd lose the values that I have in the X axis right?
