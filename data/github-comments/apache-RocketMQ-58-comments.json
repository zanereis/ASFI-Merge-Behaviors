A B topic，由于历史原因，后面不再监听B了，假设目前消费进度X。转而让消费者组C2监听了。\r\n\r\n这时候B的消息一直进来，但是C1对于B的消费进度是记录了的X的，这时候消息如果进度去到Y。这里有两个问题：\r\n\r\n1.实际上，RMQ会认为C1对于topic B是有堆积的（但是实例在线的时候不会显示，实例断线就显示了）\r\n2.假设A后面又觉得还是需要重新监听topic B，这时候就惨了。一堆堆积的历史消费都会再次消费，而且consumer_from_where并不生效，因为你曾经听过。\r\n\r\n建议在更新订阅关系的同时，对于consumer group offset也进行更新\r\n\r\n\r\n@duhenglucky
