Its intentionally bare bones because it took me a long time to stumble on the right design ideas. The challenge with LRU is that every read is a write to global, shared state. The solution is to use a database style commit log to record and replay events. We then tried to retrofit the ideas onto Guava and I rewrote it in [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine).\n\nSo if you're asking if its easy to use here for an LRU cache, then [yes](https://github.com/ben-manes/concurrentlinkedhashmap/wiki/ExampleUsage).\n\n``` java\nConcurrentMap<K, V> cache = new ConcurrentLinkedHashMap.Builder<K, V>()\n    .maximumWeightedCapacity(1000)\n    .weigher(...)\n    .build();\n```\n\nIf you're asking if its easy to implement the ideas from scratch, then its moderate. But doing it with all the features and tuning in Caffeine was [hard](http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/1/25/design-of-a-modern-cache.html). However that also replaced LRU with a modern policy, which is one of the reasons why Druid [0.9.2](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/3503) adopted it as an extension. Maybe when Druid is JDK8-based they'll make it the default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/249737358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/249928779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3516#issuecomment-249928779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3516","id":249928779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTkyODc3OQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T17:01:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T17:01:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry wrong PR destination, it needs internal testing first.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/249928779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/249955204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3517#issuecomment-249955204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3517","id":249955204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTk1NTIwNA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T18:31:12Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T18:31:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"üëç \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/249955204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/249990377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3510#issuecomment-249990377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3510","id":249990377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTk5MDM3Nw==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T20:36:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T20:36:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IMHO we shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel here.
