We have already stated they're unsupported.  I'm not personally in favour of having unsupported or broken things in the UI.  I'm happy for people to argue to keep them visible, as long as they're also going to engage with things like the two issues in my previous comment.\r\n\r\nI worked on this now, prompted by @mbien comment, because I could do with the filtering functionality in the platform anyway.

So it is probably safe to exclude the memory fs impl itself being the problem - whats left is the `MemoryFileSystem` identity or timing issues outside of mem fs code. A clue that this might be about identity is the log which is different when mem fs is in use (no matter if green or red) - so the code path certainly is different somewhere.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2395249827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2395308439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-2395308439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":2395308439,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6OxYGX","user":{"login":"sysmat","id":69830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat","html_url":"https://github.com/sysmat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysmat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-06T06:07:25Z","updated_at":"2024-10-06T06:07:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"NB version 23, OS win 11 now have problems with copy in side NB ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2395308439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2395400694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7727#issuecomment-2395400694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7727","id":2395400694,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Oxun2","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-06T11:22:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-06T11:22:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I had look at this and from my POV its a mess. The problem is, that FileZilla forces clients to reuse the TLS session used for the control channel on the data channel. Seems, that problem wracks havoc with various clients and my TL;DR take away is: FTP is dead, don't use it.\r\n\r\nThe longer version: Java implements session resumptions for TLS. However it only allows that only for the same hostname/port pair. The TLS sessions are held in a map keyed by this. But even breaking into the JDK code and faking an entry holding the same session for hostname/datachannel-port as for hostname/controlchannel-port does not help (Idea from https://gist.github.com/riyaz-ali/48fb486f51c258b4e92c2d2be30c35c4, adjusted as `getHost` does not work anymore).\r\n\r\nMessing with TLS settings also did not help on my test setup (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-408).\r\n\r\nMy final straw was adding bouncy-castle TLS to NetBeans and using its implementation for the connection (inspired by https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/458).
