It is important to note that testing on a local machine is an ideal scenario, where traffic does not have to go over a network connection to reach the browser. In standard deployments, there will be some amount of network latency. The latency could vary considerably based on a variety of factors. For those reasons, having a small size for an initial loading screen is more critical. Although it would be great to have a new look, I lean in the direction of thinking that 300 KB is too large. An SVG version would be optimal.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1785949849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1786152627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7956#issuecomment-1786152627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7956","id":1786152627,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5qdoaz","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-30T22:35:20Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T22:35:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

Other implementations, if they are caching some internal state depending on \"controller service\" property might have a similar challenge.\r\n\r\n@exceptionfactory You are perfectly right, the Flow Registry Client currently has no such lifecycle states like active-deactivated, that is correct. At the time of changing the Client to a component, this was an intentional choice due to the number of questions would come with this behavioural change (and due to avoiding any break in the previous behaviour). The questions include: what should happen with the existing versioned flows when the registry is deactivated? It looks like a different case compared to the situation when the registry is unintenionally unreachable and might result some confusion. An other possibility you mention is to \"hook on\" some existing event like validation or as you mention, the (de)activation of the dependent Controller Services but I am not aware of any support in the framework for this.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose to do is to move on with this fix (which in some cases can cause misbehaviour as it is now) and for a wider scope solution it would be beneficial to start a discussion about the level of support we aim for: I can easily imagine that an additional hookpoint might be useful for other components as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1790512269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1790832184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7965#issuecomment-1790832184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7965","id":1790832184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5qve44","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-02T14:22:18Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T14:22:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, I think it's better to solve this at the framework level as well.

Please rebase.\r\n\r\nI installed NiFi and played with this feature. It worked as expected moving to parent, to a child process group where referencing components exist, to a child process group where referencing components do not exist (and references to the controller service were then removed automatically). All worked great.\r\n\r\nThe UX is intuitive and provides sufficient warning to the user that referencing components may be adversely affected by the controller service move. \r\n\r\nI confirmed the API documentation contains the new `move` endpoint.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I tested only using single-user-authorizer, so I have not yet tested possible authorization issues such as attempting to move the controller service to a process group where the user does not have modify permission.\r\n\r\nSee the couple comments on the code itself, but generally this looks great.

We have users with a mix of hortonworks / confluent setup (schema encoding following the hortonworks approach but sending the data into confluent, and vice versa). We removed the HWX Schema Registry but I think removing the schema encoding strategies does not have the same level of impact and one could wonder why we keep Confluent but not HWX/Cloudera. A cleaner approach would probably to have the schema encoding as an extension point so that it can be part of the NARs but it sounds like a significant effort that is not really worth it. Wouldn't be easier here to just rename the classes using the Cloudera name and keep both Cloudera and Confluent? I could even see value in reverting the removal of the HWX Schema Registry and just rename it given that we keep the equivalent for Confluent and we're adding support for additional Schema Registries (Glue, Apicurio, etc).

As this presents an important behavioral change in the Processor, it would be helpful to add a unit test method that verifies the expected behavior when the property is disabled. Also note that property names should use [Title Case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case) for naming.\r\n\r\nAgreed, when the capability for using database types was added it was decided purposely to not offer a property, to simplify the user experience and be flexible in which types were used, to be as smart as possible at inferring the user's intent when putting data of one type in the record into a column in the database with a different type, such as String -> Timestamp. This PR should have at least a handful of tests (or multiple different types in one or more tests) for covering possible users' intents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1802883745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1804007639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7997#issuecomment-1804007639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7997","id":1804007639,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5rhvjX","user":{"login":"ferencerdei","id":89379649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzc5NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89379649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei","html_url":"https://github.com/ferencerdei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferencerdei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T15:05:55Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T15:05:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the comments, I've applied them.

Reviewing the implementation details, the general concept of a configurable column normalization strategy is helpful.\r\n> \r\n> As a general recommendation, it looks like it would be helpful to make `ColumnNameNormalizer` an interface, with `getNormalizedName(String columnName)` as the interface method. Although the current implementation is simple enough, providing separate implementations would remove the need for the conditional logic. Given that this method will be called for every column, there seems to be value in having narrowly defined implementation classes.\r\n\r\nHi @exceptionfactory \r\nthanks for suggestion i will make required changes ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1806990586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1807395607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8003#issuecomment-1807395607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8003","id":1807395607,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5ruqsX","user":{"login":"wanghangyu817","id":18672877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcyODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18672877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817","html_url":"https://github.com/wanghangyu817","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wanghangyu817/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-13T02:47:00Z","updated_at":"2023-11-13T02:48:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@exceptionfactory Thanks for the reply！\r\n\r\nOk, let me sort out the rest of the work:\r\n1.
