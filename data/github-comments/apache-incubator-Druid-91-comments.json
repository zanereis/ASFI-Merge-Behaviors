If the bitmap had more than half of the bits set that make up one block, one would aggregate over the inverted bitmap and subtract the result from the pre-aggregated value that is stored for that block.\nThis would ensure that in the worst case, only half of a block's records would have to be aggregated.\nSeeing how the query latency is mostly determined by how many records remain to be aggregated after filtering, it seems that the opportunity of cutting these in half is worth holding the pre-aggregated values.\nWhere to keep those aggregates is of course another topic. They could go into the segments or be kept in some cache....\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224227709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224247151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3093#issuecomment-224247151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3093","id":224247151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDI0NzE1MQ==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T10:57:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T10:57:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224247151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224248006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3092#issuecomment-224248006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3092","id":224248006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDI0ODAwNg==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T11:02:00Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T11:02:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224248006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224248142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3092#issuecomment-224248142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3092","id":224248142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDI0ODE0Mg==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T11:02:38Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T11:02:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"this

The question then would be what time granularity to choose for those pre-aggregated records, since that may differ from the underlying segment granularity. Your example case would work for simple sum aggregations, but it would not necessarily extend to complex aggregations or even min / max aggregations, since those do not necessarily support subtracting rows. It sounds like this could help in a small number of use cases, but I'm not sure if it's worth the added complexity. Given that this is unrelated to the topic of this issue, I suggest opening a separate issue if you'd like to discuss further.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224346621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224346782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3096#issuecomment-224346782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3096","id":224346782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM0Njc4Mg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T17:04:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T17:04:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"oops wrong base\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224346782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/224348216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3095#issuecomment-224348216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3095","id":224348216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM0ODIxNg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T17:09:06Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T17:09:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok thanks for testing it @himanshug \n\n👍  from me.

nothing's wrong with dimensionSpec in principle, I just wanted to point out that there are some things extractionFns can do that dimensionSpecs can't, which would need to be addressed before they can really be unified.\n\nIn particular, some that I can think of are,\n- ability to chain with other extractionFns\n- ability to expose `preservesOrdering` and `isOneToOne` for filters and query
