However, I do think you are trying to tackle too many things in one PR making it too big. In addition I would like to see a better design description. The commit and PR message do not describe why and what with reasoning. This makes it very hard to review.\r\n\r\nOverall I think this PR needs to be split. I suggest splitting it into:\r\n\r\n* Add max_tries and attempt to task instances\r\n(Question: is max_tries related to attempts or retries? Please make sure you name correctly and update documentation)\r\n\r\n* Move logging handling for TIs into logging.py\r\nHere I would suggest to have something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport airflow.logging as logging\r\n\r\nlog = logging.get_task_logger(task_instance)\r\n\r\n```\r\n`get_task_logger` should expose the standard logging interface.\r\n\r\n* Obtain log per attempt per task instance in UI\r\n`log.get_task_log(task_instance)`\r\n\r\nairflow.logging is an interface to the underlying Handlers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes it more manageable and allows for tracking down issues/regressions per commit.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/312211754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/312333715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2408#issuecomment-312333715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2408","id":312333715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjMzMzcxNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-30T17:58:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T23:28:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2408?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2408](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2408?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/644f5d43a49d621dbd2e3f4d4731bf85c240f080?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2408/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2408?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #2408   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   69.27%   69.27%           \n=======================================\n  Files         146      146           \n  Lines       11230    11230           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7780     7780           \n  Misses       3450     3450\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2408?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2408?src=pr&el=footer).
