Shared Zk node path between LocalApplicationRunner's leader election and JC's leader election\r\n2. zkClient connection created in LocalApplicationRunner is not closed until the processor terminates.\r\n3. Lack of our ability to distinguish between streamApplication restart Vs processor group membership change. The same latch remains open for every lifecycle of the application. \r\n\r\nHere is how I understand the current implementation of intermediate streams is behaving:\r\n1. The first processor becomes the leader and completes the intermediate stream creation. Other processors block on the latch\r\n2. If the leader succeeds in the critical operation, it will countdown latch and exit. Other processors that are blocked on the latch will get unblocked. However, since the zkclient connection is still left open, others processors become leader in-turn and repeat the operation.\r\n\r\nWhat I believe is missing is that there is no **state** indicating that the critical operation was completed. Neither is there a validation of whether critical section operation has to be performed or not nor is there a clear distinction between application restart and processor restart. I believe we are trying to address this issue in PR #264  (fyi, I don't think the PR is complete). \r\n\r\nOn the point about closing the zkClient connection after critical operation vs during processor shutdown:\r\n* I don't see a lot of value in leaving the connection open after the ZK related operations are completed in the LAR layer. We don't want to continue receiving notifications on the processor group membership change after this phase\r\n* Unnecessary n/w resource utilization\r\n* This issues will get further magnified since we are not handling session timeouts in this layer and all event's from ZK will be handled in the event thread, thereby blocking the event thread itself. This may causes unexpected issues further down the road.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/321619604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/321703423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/266#issuecomment-321703423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/266","id":321703423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTcwMzQyMw==","user":{"login":"jmakes","id":7254655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTQ2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7254655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes","html_url":"https://github.com/jmakes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmakes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-10T23:53:14Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T23:54:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fredji97

The original import lines were importing Assert class with *, so there is nothing to remove there. \r\n\r\nDepending on the code style and best practice, most recommend not to use * to do wildcard matching (which I prefer), but some may think it is better to keep the existing style for consistency purpose.

\r\n>Is it possible to add some kind of testing for orphaned containers problem itself ?\r\n\r\nI wanted to do that before sending the patch for review. \r\n\r\nScenario to test is interruption of a particular task (SamzaContainerLauncher) which gets triggered as effect on zk event sequence chain.\r\n\r\nBut all logic to spawn SamzaContainer in standalone is hidden within `StreamProcessor.createJobCoordinatorListener` (It's hard to pull that which in itself would require huge refactoring).\r\n\r\nI was thinking to mimic `ZkJobCoordinator`/`StreamProcessor` logic to test interrupting a running samza conatiner within ScheduleDebounce thread.

Imho the 'serdes only in code' and 'only 2 levels of serde' model is much simpler to understand. The risk is that there might be streams that aren't part of the user application code, but need their serdes to be set in configuration. An example is the logging topic. Do you think this is a reasonable choice?\r\n\r\n👍  for this.

Moved Serde classes from samza-core to samza-api.\r\n3. Created a JsonSerdeV2 that useds the default ObjectMapper instead of SamzaObjectMapper.\r\n4. Removed the restriction that users can't specify serdes in config. This is required for sinkTo to work since we don't control what streams they can output to. There are workarounds, but they're kinda hacky. Serdes provided in high level api code still take priority over those provided in configs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/330393422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/330607489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/297#issuecomment-330607489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/297","id":330607489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDYwNzQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T17:09:15Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T17:09:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jmakes : could you please help take a look?
