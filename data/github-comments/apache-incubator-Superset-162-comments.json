looking at a few options, we are currently exploring using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The main advantages of using cypress is that 1. it's promise based so we don't need to sleep to wait for responses, nice features around debugging, it's faster (doesn't need to spin up a browser for each test), and is less flaky.\r\n\r\nDownsides: it runs tests inside the browser so it's harder to communicate with the db. Also currently there's no headless chrome, but it looks like they are working on it. It will currently run headless Electron. There's only support for Chrome and Electron, but this isn't a problem for us as we don't need to test on other platforms. List of trade offs [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs.html#).\r\n\r\nWe are still exploring to make sure it will work for a variety of cases but anyone have any major concerns?
