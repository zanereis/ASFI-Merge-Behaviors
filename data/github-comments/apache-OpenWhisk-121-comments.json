Why should it assume anything about the providers, where they store their data, or the format. Each of the providers should handle cleaning up their own assets.

I’m not convinced we should conflate this repo with dependencies for the providers.

\r\nThe reason for your problems is that the uid of the root user on the vm (where Ansible does work) and the uid of the root user inside the container (which is used at runtime) are different . \r\nSo setting the access rights in Ansible does not work. \r\nFor the same reason setting the access rights  of a mounted file system does not work \r\nwhen issued from the container.\r\n\r\nWe encountered the same problem with containers and invokers. \r\nOur solution was to write a container startup script (`open/common/scala/copyJMXFiles.sh`) \r\nwhich copies the jmx related files into the container filesystem and changes a the access rights afterwards.
