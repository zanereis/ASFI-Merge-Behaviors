I was taking a look and the best way to fix this is to replace the `TreeMap` with a `HashMap`, i.e. do `final Set tps = new HashSet<>();`. \n`TopicPartition` implements `equals()` and `hashCode()` so if you change the line as suggested nothing else needs to be done. Ordering is not important here, so `HashMap` is indeed the most appropriate data structure here, and the one I meant to use to begin with.\n\nThe appropriate way to do code contributions is to create a Pull Request and push it for review by the community. Please find the documentation on how to do so in here:\n- http://storm.apache.org/contribute/Contributing-to-Storm.html\n- https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#contribute-code\n- https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#pull-requests\n\nI am in the process of submitting a patch with an updated README and a few more things. Since this is such a small fix, I can include this fix there, and mention that the credit should go to you. However, if you with to create the pull request yourself to receive the deserved credit, please go ahead and I will review it right away.\n\nPlease let me know and thanks once again.

think?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612898900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/214090708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1352#issuecomment-214090708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1352","id":214090708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDA5MDcwOA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T01:51:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T01:51:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also
