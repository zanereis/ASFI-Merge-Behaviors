Here comes the second observation: the only case where`attach_map_` can have an entry for `ForNode` is if this `ForNode` is a parallel for loop, due to these lines: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7340c02d0efe0f5eb5692fb9f4cc7573c5d056cb/src/tir/transforms/storage_rewrite.cc#L766-L772 \r\n\r\nTogether, these two handler for `ForNode` lift allocation inside an inner loop and attach merged allocation under the parallel loop scope (via `MakeAttach` function at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7340c02d0efe0f5eb5692fb9f4cc7573c5d056cb/src/tir/transforms/storage_rewrite.cc#L447). This is what's tested in `test_parallel_alloc()`. For other kinds of `For` loop, a merged allocation is placed at the global scope, see https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7340c02d0efe0f5eb5692fb9f4cc7573c5d056cb/src/tir/transforms/storage_rewrite.cc#L457-L461.  \r\n\r\nSince `While` node doesn't involve threading, I think we can always lift allocation done inside `While` loop into the global scope. That means `WhileNode` should be handled in the same way non-parallel `ForNode` are handled, i.e. we don't need a special handling logic for `WhileNode`. Two simple test cases involving `While`  loop are added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/c3af5ae9aa611580004ce03d16aa952ab124d826/tests/python/unittest/test_tir_transform_storage_rewrite.py#L301 to test allocation is attached at the right scope after `storage_rewrite`.\r\n\r\nI think I nailed it, thoughts?

When `inputs` is 1D , and `offsets` is given, we simply have to convert `offsets` into `segment_ids` and `inputs` would directly be `indices`. To convert `offsets` into `segment_ids` we have to use a combination of `adjacent_difference`, `arange` and  `repeat` : For example: `offsets` of `[0,4]` with size of 10 would translate to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and `relay.segment_sum` could be called on it. \r\n2. When `inputs` is 2D, its more easier where we convert the input size `[B,N]` to `[0,0,0... Ntimes ... ,1,1,1,... N Times ..... B-1,B-1, .... N Times]`  This would require `arange` and `repeat`.  And then use flattened `inputs` as `indices` and the converted input size (now 1D) as `segment_ids`. Then `relay.segment_sum` could be called on it. \r\n\r\nNow all of these ops exist except `adjacent_difference` although @ymwangg wrote an IR for it. Is it possible to call it in any form or if not , do you think its worthwhile to make it an op ? [Numpy equivalent](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ediff1d.html)\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on the best way to reuse existing code. After that implementation would be only a trivial few lines.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/788795464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/788808925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7562#issuecomment-788808925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7562","id":788808925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4ODgwODkyNQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-02T10:38:22Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T10:38:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok lets do embedding bag later, then.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/788808925/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/789031004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7559#issuecomment-789031004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7559","id":789031004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4OTAzMTAwNA==","user":{"login":"tkonolige","id":1501680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1501680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige","html_url":"https://github.com/tkonolige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-02T16:23:23Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T16:23:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LoadParams is a free standing function that we would like to use at runtime with the VM (because there is no clear way to directly load parameters into the VM).
