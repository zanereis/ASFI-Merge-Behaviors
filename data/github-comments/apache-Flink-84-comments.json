The general rule is not to reformat comments or indentation for anything not touched in the pull request. Otherwise all people keep just formatting back and forth each others changes, because everyone believes they personally figured out the better code style ;-) Would be good to undo the changes in the `FileSystem` class, for example.\n- Some tests would be great. With refactorings of YARN going on, I can see that this change will be accidentally undone next time something with a main() method is touched, unless a test guards

Let me explain the issue.\n\nIn the common case as for example in a WordCount program, the operator order looks like this:\n\n```\n[Map] --hash-partition--> [Reduce]\n```\n\nin this case, a combiner will be append to the Map to reduce the data before it is partitioned over the network. This looks like:\n\n```\n[Map] --local-fwd--> [Combine] --hash-partition--> [Reduce]\n```\n\nIn some cases, Flink knows that the data is already appropriately partitioned (e.g. after a join):\n\n```\n[Join] --local-fwd--> [Reduce]\n```\n\nin this case, the data is already local and no combiner needs to injected. The check is based on the shipping strategy of the input channel (this is the `if` case in `instantiate()`).\n\nIn case of an explicit partition operator, the operators look as follows:\n\n```\n[Map] --partition--> [Partition] --local-fwd--> [Reduce]\n```\n\nhence, the code enters the `if` case, because the input shipping strategy is `FORWARD`.\nInstead we would like to inject a combiner between Map and Partition as follows:\n\n```\n[Map] --local-fwd--> [Combine] --partition--> [Partition] --local-fwd--> [Reduce]\n```\n\nHence, we should adapt the condition to inject a combiner if the input strategy of Reduce is `FORWARD` and the input operator is a `PartitionNode`.\n\nWe should add appropriate tests for this feature. I suggest:\n- a unit test case in `GroupReduceCompilationTest`\n- a unit test case in `ReduceCompilationTest`\n- an end-to-end integration test in `javaApiOperators.GroupReduceITCase` \n- an end-to-end integration test in `javaApiOperators.ReduceITCase` \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/176754489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/176838607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1514#issuecomment-176838607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1514","id":176838607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjgzODYwNw==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-29T16:06:18Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T16:06:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are there any objections to merging this?

The first problem is still the handling of exceptions when calling stop on the Invokable in Task.stopExecution. The exception will only be logged but no further action is taken. This can lead to a situation where we have a corrupted state. I think, we should fail the task in such a situation.\n\nI see what you mean, but we would not get a corrupted state, do we? However, I agree that if `Task.stopExecution` throws an exception,  we should report this to the user somehow (not just by logging). Failing the task is fine with me. I updated the code for this.\n\n> Additionally, the case that a task cannot be found on the TaskManager and that an exception occurs in Task.stopExecution are treated identically by sending a TaskOperationResult with success == false to the JobManager. On the JobManager side this will only be logged. I think the exception case should be handled differently. Failing the execution, for example.\n\nThis should not be necessary. There are two exception cases here: (1) The task in not stoppable (ie, for a batch job). Failing the execution would of course not be appropriate. (2) `Task.stopExecution` throws and exception. This case is handled already by the discussion from above.\n\n> And it is still possible that you send a StopJob message to the JobManager, see that the job is in state RUNNING, then the ExecutionGraph switches to RESTARTING, and then the stop call is executed on the ExecutionGraph which won't have an effect. As a user you will receive a StoppingSuccess message but the job will simply be restarted. I think we should also allow stopping jobs when they are in the state RESTARTING.\n\nDesign decision.  I extended allowed states for STOP to CREATED, RUNNING, and RESTARTING, which is the easier solution. Not sure if we should include CREATED or not though...
