\nThat's not exactly how it should be used, the goal is to use it as a data storage.\nLet's say you have a similar DataFactory as the one I gave in example:\n\n```\nangular.module('zeppelinWebApp').factory('systemConfDataFactory', function() {\n  var vm = {};\n\n  vm.conf = {};\n\n  vm.setSystemConf = function(systemConf) {\n    vm.conf = angular.copy(systemConf);\n  };\n  return vm;\n});\n```\n\nThen you just have to call `setSystemConf` in your websocketEvents like this:\n\n```\nangular.module('zeppelinWebApp').factory('websocketEvents', function ( ...,  systemConfDataFactory) {\n  websocketCalls.ws.onMessage(function(event) {\n    ...\n    } else if (op === 'GET_SYSTEM_CONF') {\n      systemConfDataFactory.setSystemConf(data.conf);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd when you need to do some ng-if or ng-hide, you can do like this:\n`home.controller`\n\n```\n angular.module('zeppelinWebApp').controller('HomeCtrl', function(..., systemConfDataFactory) {\n   vm.systemConfDataFactory = systemConfDataFactory;\n```\n\n`home.html`\n\n```\n\n<h5 ng-hide=\"home.systemConfDataFactory.conf.readonly\">\n  <a href=\"\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#noteNameModal\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\">\n    <i style=\"font-size: 15px;\" class=\"icon-notebook\"></i> Create new note</a>\n</h5>\n\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/157601761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/157602065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/429#issuecomment-157602065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/429","id":157602065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzYwMjA2NQ==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T04:31:41Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T04:31:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo
