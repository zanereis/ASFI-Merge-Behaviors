Coupled with retention, this config can help determine how much data is stored for a table.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a different behavior. For our use case, we want to give tables a set storage quota as we are disk constrained. Ingestion increases are fine as long as long as we don’t store addition data overall. An ingestion rate quota would impact the freshness of our data\r\n\r\n> I guess the ask here is to introduce a size based retention manager in addition to the current time based.

Coupled with retention, this config can help determine how much data is stored for a table.\r\n> \r\n> Storage quota cannot be really enforced if the ingestion rate starts to increase.\r\n\r\nI think this is very use case dependent. If the queries issued to the real-time table need to scan data over a fixed period (e.g., the last three months), it's imperative that the time retention of the table exceeds that window. This would make storage-based retention configurations less applicable for such a table. On the other hand, if a table doesn't have strict query-time requirements, a storage-based quota could indeed be a good fit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1673575018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1673742593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11306#issuecomment-1673742593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11306","id":1673742593,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5jw0kB","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-10T18:54:19Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T18:54:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available.

So the likely case is that all replicas go down eventually, perhaps within short time of each other.\r\n\r\nFurther, if only a subset of replicas go down, there is still at least one replica alive to complete the segment. Once the segment is complete, the transition from OFFLINE to ONLINE would arrive, and everything would return back to normal.The thought here is that the other replicas are enough to serve queries. After all , only one segment will be routed to some other replica. The server in question can continue to serve other segments of the table.\r\n\r\nLastly, let us say we try to modify the state back to CONSUMING in idealstate. We will need to worry about race conditions where the segment may be in completing stage. Also, the host may have to feverishly catch up to the data only to find that some other replica is at the point of completing the segment.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we decided to fix the situation only if all replicas are OFFLINE.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1675585363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1675607945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11328#issuecomment-1675607945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11328","id":1675607945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5j37-J","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-12T01:47:46Z","updated_at":"2023-08-12T05:37:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11328?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#11328](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11328?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (4a11286) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/8a86c7b1f29b19102ee6198732ca02fcb80ea14f?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (8a86c7b) will **increase** coverage by `0.04%`.\n> Report is 2 commits behind head on master.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #11328      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     68.14%   68.18%   +0.04%     \n- Complexity     6524     6534      +10     \n============================================\n  Files          2239     2239              \n  Lines        120441   120467      +26     \n  Branches      18223    18229       +6     \n============================================\n+ Hits          82074    82145      +71     \n+ Misses        32526    32486      -40     \n+ Partials       5841     5836       -5     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `20.92% <0.00%> (+0.06%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `25.53% <100.00%> (+0.23%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| java-11 | `68.10% <100.00%> (+0.57%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| java-17 | `67.96% <100.00%> (+2.40%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| java-20 | `68.00% <100.00%> (+2.41%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| temurin | `68.18% <100.00%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `67.09% <100.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `14.59% <0.00%> (+<0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
