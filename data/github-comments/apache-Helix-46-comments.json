When a node is brought down for maintenance, it's still considered as holding replicas that are initially assigned to it. Consequently, the actual active replica number remains 2 for the subsequent 16 hours. And one of Helix's clients is asking for a feature that can quickly bootstrap the third replica even during the delay window. This functionality is crucial to ensure that they have sufficient cluster availability guarantee to start their cluster-wise maintenance task. \r\n\r\nFor your 5min delay problem, [here](https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/fbefa64909781d479ec486a93d22bba416322fb8/helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/model/ClusterConfig.java#L62) is how Helix configure the delay time. Based on my understanding, Pinot should have a similar configuration. And you can probably tune it to reduce the rebalance lag.\r\n\r\n@jadami10  Hope this answers your question.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1709081211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1709231412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2551#issuecomment-1709231412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2551","id":1709231412,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5l4M00","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-06T22:56:34Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T22:56:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This test fails in: https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/6102235345","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1709231412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1709352953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2594#issuecomment-1709352953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2594","id":1709352953,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5l4qf5","user":{"login":"jadami10","id":4760722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjA3MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4760722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10","html_url":"https://github.com/jadami10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jadami10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-07T01:59:09Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T01:59:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yup this answers it!
