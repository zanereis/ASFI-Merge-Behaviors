In our case if one controller has failed and rejoined the cluster as a new member, there will be some garbage accumulated in the list of cluster members. It is not harmful per se, e.g. the cluster is still running, however healthy cluster nodes will be still gossiping with a non-existing container. If assigning static IP addresses is not an option, in order to avoid this case one could use auto-downing feature in akka cluster, which allows to a cluster leader to mark the failing node as down and remove it from the cluster. To prevent cluster partitioning due to several leaders this property must be set to a relatively high value. The number is not deterministic and could be defined based on the further ops experience. \r\nOne could also think of another monitoring component that is going to watch the cluster state and down the failed nodes on demand. But this solution is rather an expensive one and I think it doesn't belong to the context of this PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/331454958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/331460912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2675#issuecomment-331460912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2675","id":331460912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQ2MDkxMg==","user":{"login":"jessealva","id":7730456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzA0NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7730456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva","html_url":"https://github.com/jessealva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessealva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T14:21:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T14:21:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like the travis error was due to the inability to grab logs from the container and not actual test failures.

No, comments gets removed when you write any property. **This is more or less** the original behavior.\r\n\r\nReadProps is ignoring comments, for example if you have a single line comment it will be ignored by this following line that checks for a format like KEY=VALUE\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tools/cli/go-whisk-cli/commands/util.go#L936\r\n\r\nThen when you write a property it is using the map returned by ReadProps as a basis for all the property values.\r\nPlease also look at this line: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tools/cli/go-whisk-cli/commands/util.go#L960 that does the write.\r\n\r\nWe should create a new issue to address this because it will require to change the logic of how the properties are set because the whole file is overwritten.\r\n**I could also do that fix if you assign it to me**. In this case for writing to the file we must locate the proper line where the key is and update just that line. If that key does not exist then we should append at the end of the file.\r\n\r\n**Sequence from the original code:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeveloper@ubuntu:~/workspace/f4/openwhisk$ cat ~/.wskprops \r\nAPIHOST=http://localhost:1004\r\n# test 1\r\nNAMESPACE= blah #test 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeveloper@ubuntu:~/workspace/f4/openwhisk$ bin/wsk property get --namespace\r\nwhisk namespace          blah #test\r\n```\r\n**NOTE:** Getting the comment with the property looks strange.. so I've removed this with my changes.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeveloper@ubuntu:~/workspace/f4/openwhisk$ bin/wsk property set --apihost http://localhost:1005\r\nok: whisk API host set to http://localhost:1005\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeveloper@ubuntu:~/workspace/f4/openwhisk$ cat ~/.wskprops \r\nAPIHOST=http://localhost:1005\r\nNAMESPACE= blah #test 2\r\n```\r\n**NOTE:** The single line comment is lost, but the inline comment is maintained.\r\n\r\nIn resume, with my changes, I'm not maintained the inline comments nor the single line.\r\nSo, I think that we should update how we write the properties file so we could maintain all comments and original formatting.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/331904433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/331922630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2768#issuecomment-331922630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2768","id":331922630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTkyMjYzMA==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T15:42:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T15:42:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mdeuser,

want to discuss the preferred approach for this issue.\r\nIf we keep current package binding feature, I think expected sub-tasks for this issue are as follow:\r\n\r\n1. [Optional] Add new flag(ex: `bindings`) to determine whether bound actions should be listed in `list actions` API or not.\r\n2. List up all bound packages in the namespace.\r\n3. Read `binding` field from each bound packages and list up all actions with `full entity path` of reference package(binding package).\r\n4. Change `namespace` field of each retrieved actions to the value of bound package`s one.\r\n5. Combine all results with non-bound actions.\r\n\r\nI think this will cause a few overhead in terms of latency.\r\n\r\nAlternative approach is as follow:\r\nCopy actions information when binding a package.\r\nBound actions may have `binding` field to be distinguishable from the others.\r\n\r\nWith this change, controller can retrieve actions transparently with `actions` view no matter whether action is bound or not.\r\nBut it will introduce more spatial overhead in CouchDB.\r\n\r\nAnd it is required to add few method to handle bound entities.\r\nFor example, it is required to prevent `update API` on bound action.\r\nAnd in case reference package is deleted, bound package and action should return proper error message and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am inclined to the second option, but want to hear any opinions or feedbacks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/332112247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/332151986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1843#issuecomment-332151986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1843","id":332151986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjE1MTk4Ng==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T10:10:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T10:10:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If you list packages, you will find there is a binding annotation already on assets that are bindings. We could add information in the list view though to make the client side join easier.\r\n\r\nI think the second option if I understood it changes the semantics of package bindings. From by reference to by copy. The benefits of the former is one copy vs many. If one is going to share the package say on GitHub the making copies through existing deploy mechanisms make more sense.
