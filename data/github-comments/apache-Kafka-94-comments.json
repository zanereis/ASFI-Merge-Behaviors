It looks good. Also, it seems that the change we made in the patch would be more sensitive to the request rate and the keys per request because that may impact the size of the operations queue. I increased the rate to 10000, fixed the request size at 1000, and only changed keys per request to 10 and 100. And here are the results.\n\nTest off the trunk\n\n| Keys per request | elapsed time ms | target rate | actual rate | process cpu time ms | G1 Old Generation count | G1 Young Generation count | G1 Old Generation time ms | G1 Young Generation time ms |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10 | 100681 | 9942.235611 | 9942.235611 | 17770 | 0 | 22 | 0 | 102 |\n| 100 | 100181 | 9991.906556 | 9991.906556 | 46760 | 0 | 49 | 0 | 261 |\n\nTest with the patch\n\n| Keys per request | elapsed time ms | target rate | actual rate | process cpu time ms | G1 Old Generation count | G1 Young Generation count | G1 Old Generation time ms | G1 Young Generation time ms |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10 | 99810 | 10029.08435 | 10029.08435 | 19420 | 0 | 34 | 0 | 125 |\n| 100 | 99880 | 10022.04851 | 10022.04851 | 55620 | 0 | 166 | 0 | 537 |\n\nIt looks GC and CPU time is a little higher with the patch (which is expected due to memory copy), but it seems not that bad. I also tested 50pct latency of 10 ms and 75pct latency of 20 ms (the approximate number we see in real system) and the result did not vary much. Given that in reality we rarely see the request rate reaching 10000, I think it is probably fine.

This is the main reason why `scala.List` is still the default immutable collection type in Scala (as `Vector` is a better general purpose collection otherwise).\n\nI mention this because Jun said that the watch list per key would be small.
