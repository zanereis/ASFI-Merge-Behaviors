As you pointed out, a simple `docker ps -a --filter 'name=wsk*'` will give you all action containers. With your renaming proposal, all containers containing `prewarm` in their name are pre-warmed while all others are warm - ignoring error conditions for the moment.\r\n\r\nThe downside of renaming is that it takes time. It will add to the latency of pre-warmed invocations, i.e. Node.js invocations will take longer. Did you run any specific performance benchmarks to understand the effects of renaming or did you compare performance test results of Travis builds?\r\n\r\nI only had a very short look at your code changes. You are adding a `rename()` operation to the ContainerProxy workflow - but it seems that you don't test whether renames are properly performed in ContainerProxy tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/432992661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/433025555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4083#issuecomment-433025555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4083","id":433025555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzAyNTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T12:09:25Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T12:09:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

My main concern is that there is nothing actionable an operator can do from seeing a collection of named containers which may indicate some system-wide resource consumption state.  At best, this approach seems to be an attempt at a stop-gap measure for \"container watchers\", but could never replace and still require deeper analysis via log/monitoring tools to be actionable.

If we used a pre-warmed container, then the container name is stuck containing just \"prewarm\" and does not contain the name of the function.  It does not seem unreasonable to support an invariant that there is some external meta-data on the action container that indicates the name of the function that is being served by the container.   In the case of raw DockerContainerFactory, the \"metadata\" being used here is the container name.  In the case of KubernetesContainerFactory, we would use a label on the pod and not rely on the pod name.\r\n\r\nIts not really about telling prewarm from warm, but about being able to externally  map from containers to the namespace/function they are executing.
