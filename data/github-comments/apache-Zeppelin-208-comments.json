tried many times following some of the configurations above, but for some strange reason, keep getting  redirected to `http://ZEPPELIN_ROOT/null`. It appears that a request for `http://ZEPPELIN_ROOT/api/security/ticket` is denied (\"unauthorized request\") and subsequently redirected to`/null` (It does this very quickly, had to use a packet sniffer to discover this). Strangely enough, however, I can manually access `http://ZEPPELIN_ROOT/api/security/ticket`, login, and then once I manually navigate to `http://ZEPPELIN_ROOT` it shows I'm logged in.\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure where the `null` is coming from and not sure what to do (or if OpenID Connect is still supported). I attached my shiro.ini file below (`localhost:8085` is my Keycloak Root and `localhost:8080` is my Zeppelin Root).\r\n\r\n[shiro.txt](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/files/4808749/shiro.txt)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/647061756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/647088199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3812#issuecomment-647088199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3812","id":647088199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzA4ODE5OQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-21T07:03:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T07:03:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution, @pranavtharoor I will review it later","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/647088199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/647089649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3812#issuecomment-647089649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3812","id":647089649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzA4OTY0OQ==","user":{"login":"pranavtharoor","id":22600061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAwMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22600061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor","html_url":"https://github.com/pranavtharoor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-21T07:17:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T07:17:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure.

You can view the rendered Yaml with [the log level DEBUG](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3825/files#diff-6d1d3084f55bdd519e39ede4a619e73dR249). I changed the [jinja2 rendering](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3825/files#diff-dea004f3a0a9203358ea5ee2143ab8afR42-R43) a little bit, maybe this is related to your problem.\r\n\r\nI noticed some bugs in the jinja rendering (e.g. jinja comments), but overall the jinja rendering is very powerful. By the way, the kubernetes Java library supports variable substitution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/651673149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/651889387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3834#issuecomment-651889387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3834","id":651889387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTg4OTM4Nw==","user":{"login":"pranavtharoor","id":22600061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAwMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22600061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor","html_url":"https://github.com/pranavtharoor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pranavtharoor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-30T16:01:43Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T16:01:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo Thanks for the review!
