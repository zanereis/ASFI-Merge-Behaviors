are easy to reproduce locally) \r\nTest timing:\r\n\r\n- mysql=25 mins\r\n- postgres=26 mins\r\n- sqlite=22 mins\r\n- kubernetes=22 mins\r\n\r\nSeems that by using the new approach we can save around

@pgagnon I have a couple thoughts, wondering if I could get some feedback. Currently there are four places where a pod can be configured/created that I am aware of. \r\n1. From the `airflow.cfg` with `KubernetesExecutor`.\r\n2. From an Operator with `KubernetesExecutor` using the argument ```executor_config = { 'KubernetesExecutor': { ... }}```\r\n3. From the `KubernetesPodoperator`.\r\n4. From the  `pod_mutation_hook`.\r\n\r\nIdeally there'd be one interface for all of these, whereas currently there seems to be several. 1. uses `WorkerConfiguration`, 2. uses `KubernetesExecutorConfig`, 3. uses `PodGenerator`. Each of these in turn offer a different level of coverage of the Kubernetes API, which then creates our custom `Pod` object which itself must implement all parts of the Kubernetes API and offer a serialization method into JSON which conforms with the API. Ideally we would offer a very thin layer of abstraction over the creation of a `V1Pod`object for convenience (and have this be largely backwards compatible) _and_  offer creating `V1Pod` object totally raw. This is similar to how in an ORM the abstraction doesn't offer every possible feature of SQL, and you might need to write raw SQL.\r\n\r\nMy question would be regarding backwards incompatible changes. For example, the `KubernetesPodOperator` takes some of Airflow's internal kubernetes models as arguments, such as `list[airflow.kubernetes.pod.Port]`. I have less hesitation about changing that as it resides in `/contrib`. As for the `executor_config`, I think I can arrange to have it backwards compatible for the most part I believe. \r\n\r\nThe ideal scenario in my mind is that the full `V1Pod` be exposed to users if they need, which would address tickets such as [AIRLFOW-4454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4454) and [AIRFLOW-3152](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3152) as they would have full access to the API. In another ticket, we could add functionality to just pass in configuration as a JSON/YAML string/file, which was discussed briefly [in the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/313132da516fca340243f4927e64177ea393d5ccae829d96b99f8e16@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/506757977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/506768462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5202#issuecomment-506768462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5202","id":506768462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjc2ODQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"ericcgu","id":4943759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDM3NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4943759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu","html_url":"https://github.com/ericcgu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericcgu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-28T15:07:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T15:08:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Interesting.

When the user wants to set up the GCP connection, he goes to the [Google Cloud Platform Connection](https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/connection/gcp.html).

I think adding perms to `can_userinfo` is always useful (that or we should remove the profile button, but I think it's useful even in case of ldap/sso auth.\r\n\r\n**View/edit Profile**\r\n\r\nSo to that end I think we should add the following perms:\r\n\r\n- `can_userinfo on UserDBUserModelView` and `UserRemoteUserModelView` (there doesn't seem to be ones for the other models. Curious. Will test that) This lets us _view_ the profile page. \r\n\r\n  _Edit: the perms for the other auth modes don't show up in the DB until you have activated them once, that is why I didn't see them._\r\n\r\nWe should probably let users edit their own profiles for these two as well (the only fields that are editable are first and last name) so:\r\n\r\n- `userinfoedit on UserDBModelView` and `can this form get on UserInfoEditView` (this shows the edit button)\r\n- `can this form post on UserInfoEditView` (needed to submit the form)\r\n\r\nI will double check, but I think since the perm is `userinfoedit on UserDBModelView` that this will leave other auth mechanisms un-affected.\r\n\r\n**Password changing:**\r\n\r\n- `resetmypassword on UserDBModelView` (this shows the reset my password button - which is actually change, not reset/forgotten) (there is no matching permission for the other user models, so this only affects DB-backed users)\r\n- `can this form get on ResetMyPasswordView` (render the password change page)\r\n- `can this form post on ResetMyPasswordView` (submit the form)\r\n\r\nWill update once I've tested with another auth

I will try to revert all of those and see if they fail in the new environment (luckily it is super easy to exact-reproduce it with the pylint docker environment using ci-slim docker). Previously some of the local pylint errors were not showing up in CI but they were showing up locally due to different pylint version and local configuration. \r\n\r\nI am not sure where this came from https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938/files/b32a836fac5eeea85f09ad5460287c122911be64#diff-9753408ee5d93e5869f8ad8a047776e0R64 :). Will revert.\r\n\r\nSome other changes are actually related to the new environment changes:\r\n \r\n- Change of the run_unit_tests.sh script name: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938/files/b32a836fac5eeea85f09ad5460287c122911be64#diff-63f689d4fbfcc88aeebc63c85611ef41R83  - I changed the \"run_unit_tests.sh\" name \"run_tests.sh\" which is far more appropriate (those are not only unit tests). So I figured updating source code comment that refers to it together with name change is a good practice :).\r\n\r\n-  AIRFLOW_SOURCES_DIR was a wrong name in this comment. I changed it (but wrongly) it should be AIRFLOW_SOURCES instead (I cleaned up and standardised use of AIRFLOW_SOURCE/AIRFLOW_ROOT variables as it was quite messy). It is a comment only but I will fix it -   https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938/files/b32a836fac5eeea85f09ad5460287c122911be64#diff-e5927ea2fff7d7b3c1de8d69fffd1f35R43\r\n\r\n\r\n- the change with impersonation : https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938/files/b32a836fac5eeea85f09ad5460287c122911be64#diff-86b0f172baeb73219800925605a34b07R42 \r\n\r\nThis was  is the problem was that in the new environment this test fails because the whole test environment was modified to support this case. It was one of the first failing test in the new CI environment which I fixed. \r\n\r\nI could not easily do exactly the same approach in the exact same way as it was done in the old environment. For one in the new environment everything runs as root. This is another fix (along the way) because of the way local sources are mounted on Linux when you try to run tests locally. Current way when sources are mounted and airflow user is used, works on Mac but when you try to run it on Linux with docker it breaks in cases of generated npm code etc. In the new environment starting docker with mounted local sources works also on Linux .\r\n\r\nOriginally it was done in test_run script and it was very difficult to find out that it is related to these impersonation tests. And it was actually quite bad approach as it was modifying the dag folder for o+ access - ALWAYS - just to handle this one case. \r\n\r\nI did not want to propagate the problem to the new environment - I instead decided to fix it in the tests - it seems much more appropriate. I can try to make separate PR out of that but then it would mean I will have to do quite some work to re-introduce the bad environment configuration  back in the new one, apply the fix and remove the workaround. I think it is not worth it - really.

This is another fix (along the way) because of the way local sources are mounted on Linux when you try to run tests locally. Current way when sources are mounted and airflow user is used, works on Mac but when you try to run it on Linux with docker it breaks in cases of generated npm code etc. In the new environment starting docker with mounted local sources works also on Linux .\"\r\n\r\nLonger explanation: \r\n\r\nThe goal of the CI image (and upcoming breeze environment) was to make easily reproducible and manageable TravisCI-like environment using docker-compose. Ideally when you run the docker compose locally with -v <your sources>:/opt/airflow you should get the same experience as when you run Travis CI, but with locally modified code mounted from the host. It was how run_tests and docker-compose was implemented in the original environment. And it's great developer experience.\r\n\r\n You use MacOS @ashb in your development experience, so you got two things with it: \r\n* shared volumes are slow (try npm build in docker vs. npm in host and you will see the difference) \r\n* you have no problems with ownership of files for mapped volumes because it is handled by the osxfs - the changes of ownership do not propagate to MacOS (see below)\r\n\r\nPeople using Linux have different shared volumes experience (been there, done that):\r\n* shared volumes are super-fast (pretty much native speed) \r\n* by default users are not mapped so you have the same permissions and user/group ownership as in the host environment (UID/GID) are the same in host and in Docker container. Basically UIDS/GIDS are the same in Host and in Container. Re-mapping users Host-Docker requires some daemon-level modifications and it's system-wide rather than per-docker-run (see below - I provided some sources). \r\n\r\nThe latter means that if Airflow runs inside Docker container as \"airflow\" user (UID 501 - I think), it has no access to the mounted volumes  - unless the permissions for all airflow sources are set to o+rw(x). The effect you get is that the files get mounted to the Docker container but then \"airflow\" user has no access to it. I tested it on plain ubuntu desktop and it works like that in the old environment. It does not work like that in Travis/old CI environment because there is this line in the old `run_ci.sh` script as the first thing that happens when you enter the environment:\r\n```\r\nsudo chown -R airflow.airflow . $HOME/.cache $HOME/.wheelhouse/ $HOME/.cache/pip\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's fine for using the same docker-compose in Mac because changing ownership does not propagate to the Desktop user of Mac. But it propagates (or actually is simply natively changed) to the Linux Desktop user. This means that after running `run_ci.sh` script in Docker container you end up with all files having user \"501:501\" on the host -(I believe) - because this is the airflow User ID in Docker. \r\n\r\nIf you are Lucky(TM) Linux Developer, and you have the same user id 501 in the Host - nothing changes for you. But it is really distro-dependent and not guaranteed in any way - so at the end a lot of people will have with their airflow sources owned by another, or even non-existing user (if they try to use docker-compose environment) - just after entering the docker-compose environment. This is hardly nice development experience.\r\n\r\nIf we want to reach the Developer base that have Linux desktops (I bet, we want), and give them environment that easily reproduces the Travis CI one - then we have to make sure it works seamlessly for any developer having Linux workstation not only Macs.\r\n\r\nSo far the only way I found it works (in a few companies across 2 years) was to make the applications  in Docker run as root. Root will have access to all files no matter who owns them and will be able to create new files (for example .pyc) as needed. The side effect is that files created in container in airflow sources are owned by root user also in the host - this is another thing that we will have to deal with - but in the breeze environment I solved it by simply cleaning up generated files in docker and there is an easy way to delete them when you need (usually when you need to switch branches and some directories change). This is one of the features of Breeze to help with that case, that otherwise is difficult to even understand if you are not aware of Docker internals.\r\n\r\nSome additional sources: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/.  This is how file sharing works on Mac. You can read how permissions and ownership sharing works on Mac.\r\n\r\nHere is also the discussion on how you can achieve user mapping on Linux - it requires daemon modifications for docker or changing the ownership after you enter the environment (but then when the ownership is changed you change it also for host in Linux - so it's not really good for Desktop case and seamless sharing): https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22258 \r\n\r\nI hope it explains it in detail :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/507790924/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/507823351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5083#issuecomment-507823351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5083","id":507823351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzgyMzM1MQ==","user":{"login":"serkef","id":3225779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjU3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3225779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef","html_url":"https://github.com/serkef","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serkef/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T19:59:56Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T19:59:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing, merging is quite hard at this stage. \r\n@PhilipGarnero, @andriisoldatenko, can you give it another look to #5517, includes the same changes?
