The count of `TermIndex$1` and `RaftProtos$LogEntryProto` are similar here, but quite different in @jojochuang 's case.\r\n2. The count of `TermIndex$1` will be very large, so the default size of Util.CACHE, which is 1 << 16, is not enough, so the cache hit rate should be quite low.\r\n\r\nTested by running \"ozone freon

analyzed the flame graph and found that 15% of the Raftlog read locks had disappeared, which made acquiring raftlog locks faster in the write path, resulting in better write performance.This indicates that the write throughput improvement from this PR is still substantial.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1511\" alt=\"image\"

For such memory, we must.\r\n1. Identify the problem root, e.g. is there duplicated, and where is the local source of keeping that huge amount of TermIndex instances?

It's suspecting because we're only cache TermIndex in the RaftLogCache, where TermIndex should be unique. \r\nThis doesn't sound right not to understand the problem and create a *global* cache with the hope to fix it.

We have reached a consensus\r\n\r\nRegarding the question raised by **OneSizeFitsQuorum**, the concern might be that when thread A waits for the state to shut down outside the `synchronized (server)` block, it is possible that the state thread could modify some data of the server. When thread A is woken up, since some server data may have been changed by the state thread before its shutdown, the question is whether this could have any subsequent impact on thread A.\r\n\r\nOneSizeFitsQuorum recommends writing it as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Thread A:\r\n```\r\nsynchronized (server) {\r\n    future = state.shutdown();\r\n    while (!future.isDone()) {\r\n        server.wait();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Thread State:\r\n```\r\nFuture<Void> stopped;\r\n...\r\ntry {\r\n    run();\r\n} finally {\r\n    stopped.complete();\r\n    synchronized (server) {\r\n        server.notify();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn our code, the State thread may be LogAppender, FollowerState, LeaderElection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/2421158186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
