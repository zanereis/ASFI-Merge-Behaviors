\r\nBy default, echarts uses local timezone to formate time labels.\r\nBut if we set timezone to Eastern European, there would be \r\n`Eastern European Summer Time` issue, as @devyumao said.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of `Eastern European Summer Time` and `Eastern European Standard Time` is:\r\n```\r\nnew Date(1572137999999)\r\nSun Oct 27 2019 03:59:59 GMT+0300 (Eastern European Summer Time)\r\nnew Date(1572137999999 + 1)\r\nSun Oct 27 2019 03:00:00 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your case, the time axis is from Oct 1 to Oct 31, which crosses the boundary (about Oct 27),\r\nso the time labels look weird.\r\n\r\nSo, the option [useUTC](http://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#useUTC) is recommended in your case:\r\n```js\r\noption = {\r\n    useUTC: true,\r\n    xAxis: {...},\r\n    yAxis: {...}\r\n    series: {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you are using string-formatted time in data (for example, `\"2019-10-01\"`),\r\nwe do not need to convert the time to UTC, it's OK to keep the current time data.\r\nThe `useUTC` just make sure all of the string time formatted in consistent way.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/550346620/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/550402091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/11566#issuecomment-550402091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11566","id":550402091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDQwMjA5MQ==","user":{"login":"WebCodePro719","id":5958037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTgwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5958037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719","html_url":"https://github.com/WebCodePro719","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebCodePro719/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T16:56:52Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T16:56:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You're
