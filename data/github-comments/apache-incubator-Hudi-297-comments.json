However, two things to note:\r\n\r\n- The dummy field needs to exist when the table is created - if you try adding the dummy field via schema evolution then the same error persists, since it's caused by the reading of the existing data. So anyone creating a table with this kind of structure needs to be aware of this issue _before_ they create their table.\r\n- I need to set `config(\"spark.hadoop.parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure\", False)` to resolve a separate issue of arrays containing NULL values. When this config is set, then the above fix does not work. Regardless of the presence of a dummy field, the error appears, only instead of `Can't redefine: array`, it reads `Can't redefine: list`. I believe this means that Hudi is unusable for users that need to support NULL values in arrays, and have Arrays within Structs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is worth a note on the Hudi docs? The comprehensive schema evolution documentation is what originally attracted us to Hudi, so a warning about these situations might help others avoid this

Thank you for the reply.\r\n\r\n> hey @HEPBO3AH : do you mean to say that, even after our fix https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6864, your avg record size estimate is wrong in some cases. And as a result your are running into OOM issue.\r\n\r\nBecause of data variability, the `AvgRecordSize` is still off sometimes. This is expected, but we do not think this value is the primary cause of the issue.\r\nWe believe that the combination of `AvgRecordSize` and hudi appending the existing small files is the cause. If you read the section of the original ticket, going around hudi's feature to append to existing completely eliminated the issue for us even when we try to pack much more data into files.\r\n\r\n> also, I don't get this statement of yours \"We noticed that the class HoodieMergeHandle is not being used due to PARQUET_SMALL_FILE_LIMIT = 0 and the job passes successfully.\". can you help clarify? \r\n\r\nIn the hoodie source code, we see the following:\r\n1.

If the `PARQUET_SMALL_FILE_LIMIT = 0` this method returns empty Map\r\n3. The codepath in `HoodieMergeHandle` is not invoked when there are no files to be updated. This can be seen in the [try section of the BaseSparkCommitActionExecutor](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/e088faac9eca747f74a48f12358a3bb6f66c21d5/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/commit/BaseSparkCommitActionExecutor.java#L326).

you're on the right track with what i originally was planning in regards to how support all of the different MOR semantics (aka Record Payload implementations): \r\n\r\n1. First of all, we need to move away from embedding Record Merging semantics as Record Payload wrappers (which is exactly what RFC-46 is aiming for)\r\n2. In RFC-46 we're introducing new component called `RecordMerger` that will embody _merging semantic_ and as such will have to be aware which columns will be required to merge 2 records.

@alexeykudinkin for your reply.\r\n\r\nGot it, I saw there are 2 tickets in JIRA about this new API `RecordMerge`, [HUDI-4380](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4380), [HUDI-4988](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4988). And as mentioned in [RFC-46 doc](https://github.com/wulei0302/hudi/blob/1784fe48a0c573597b9c4aa8a9b352f4379a7554/rfc/rfc-46/rfc-46.md#record-merge-api), there will be also a `backward-compatibility bridge` introduced for the migration from `HoodieRecordPayload ` to `HoodieMerge`.\r\n\r\nMay I ask if we can know a rough timeline of these new API? Will they be released in Hudi 0.13.0? If so, I think we can refactor our code based on your new design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1306584539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1306588951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6939#issuecomment-1306588951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6939","id":1306588951,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5N4PcX","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-08T03:47:17Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T03:54:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice
