The table could perhaps be called TaskState.  \r\nThis task state should not be pegged to a specific execution date, because execution date only really makes sense for non-stateful tasks.  And execution date can be out of sequence with actual run time.\r\nI think it might make sense to make it so we don't do updates: when state changes, we insert a new record with the current state.  Primary key would be dag id / task id / timestamp.  To get current state, we get the last record for the dag / task.  It's possible we could allow state to be namespaced under task id with a column `key` like is done with XCom but I don't think it's necessary. \r\n\r\nI previously shared the concern, why create another table that is almost identical to xcom.  But the reality is XCom is problematic for stateful tasks in a number of ways.  Obviously there is the clearing / idempotency issue. But additionally if you use trigger dag, with XCom your next scheduled run won't get current state because it sorts by execution_date.\r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/557931240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/557940810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6656#issuecomment-557940810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6656","id":557940810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzk0MDgxMA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-24T23:31:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T16:48:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6656](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/bf29ef3286bc27df66b6f3ad42d19c56fd14e115?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.28%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #6656      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage    84.7%   84.42%   -0.29%     \n==========================================\n  Files         680      680              \n  Lines       38556    38556              \n==========================================\n- Hits        32659    32549     -110     \n- Misses       5897     6007     +110\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/contrib/sensors/python\\_sensor.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL3NlbnNvcnMvcHl0aG9uX3NlbnNvci5weQ==) | `100% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume\\_mount.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZV9tb3VudC5weQ==) | `44.44% <0%> (-55.56%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/volume.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3ZvbHVtZS5weQ==) | `52.94% <0%> (-47.06%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/pod\\_launcher.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3BvZF9sYXVuY2hlci5weQ==) | `45.25% <0%> (-46.72%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/kubernetes/refresh\\_config.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzL3JlZnJlc2hfY29uZmlnLnB5) | `50.98% <0%> (-23.53%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [...rflow/contrib/operators/kubernetes\\_pod\\_operator.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9jb250cmliL29wZXJhdG9ycy9rdWJlcm5ldGVzX3BvZF9vcGVyYXRvci5weQ==) | `78.75% <0%> (-20%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/6656?src=pr&el=footer).

So, suppose I want to persist state with XCom (which I do in many jobs), and I have a daily job, running at midnight.  At end of each run, we push some value to XCom.  At start of next job, we retrieve last value and use it somehow. Consider this case:\r\n* run 1: 12am D1\r\n* run 2: manually triggered at 8am (exec date is D1 8am; xcom retrieves from run 1)\r\n* run 3: 12am D2\r\n* run 4: 12am D3\r\n* run 5: 12am D4\r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\n* Run 3 will retrive the XCom from run 1, because its execution date is prior to run 2 execution date.\r\n* Run 4 retrieves run 2 for same reason.\r\n* Run 5 retrieves run 4 (finally things are back in order); run 3 xcom is never retrieved by any job.\r\n\r\nThe schedule interval edge PR would resolve the execution date ordering problem.  But if XCom is cleared at start of task, it is remains problematic as a mechanism for state persistence.\r\n\r\n> Since this will introduce such as a fundamental change to the way operators were intended, being idempotent, I think it would be great to first start an AIP on the topic, so we can have a clear and structured approach.\r\n\r\nAn AIP sounds appropriate.   But I'll just note that I see this more as better support for common use pattern rather than fundamental change of anything.  I suspect stateful use of airflow (including the use of XCom as state persistence mechanism) is quite common.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/558030520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/558050750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2460#issuecomment-558050750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2460","id":558050750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODA1MDc1MA==","user":{"login":"otienoanyango","id":10798485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzk4NDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10798485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango","html_url":"https://github.com/otienoanyango","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otienoanyango/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T08:43:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T08:43:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What happened guys?
