I just marked two instances where we could be a little more proactive with detecting errors. \n\nOne thing makes me nervous: There are no tests for `DataReader` / `DataWriter`. I'm OK with merging without tests in the interest of unblocking things. We should file a JIRA to make sure we eventually add the tests, though. @beysims, @jwang98052: What do you think? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/98153112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/98155176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/169#issuecomment-98155176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/169","id":98155176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTU1MTc2","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-01T15:17:27Z","updated_at":"2015-05-01T15:17:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll test this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/98155176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/98165915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/169#issuecomment-98165915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/169","id":98165915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTY1OTE1","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-01T15:59:42Z","updated_at":"2015-05-01T15:59:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I tested both java and .net.

thanks for the PR!\n\nI did a mostly cosmetics-focused pass. The main points are:\n1. Add JavaDocs to all new classes. If the class is just an implementation of a REST object, please add that information to the javadoc as well as a link to the YARN API docs, if any. If the class is genuinely ours, please add javadocs to all public members.\n   1. Make whatever you can `final`. IntelliJ has a Code Inspector to help you with that.\n   2. The code already had hand-written `.toString()` methods for JSON objects. Instead of repeating that probably bad idea, maybe we can use jackson to generate the strings?\n\nOf course, all these changes only apply to new or updated code. It is appreciated, but not necessary to fix my mistakes from the past :-)\n\nPlease commit additional changes into this same branch. The final committer will take care of the squashing and commit message cleanup. Please comment on this thread when you want us to take another look.
