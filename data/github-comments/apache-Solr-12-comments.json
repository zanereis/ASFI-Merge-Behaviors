Maybe even do a commit in-between.  I found the `gw why --hash=deadbeef` command useful too.  I did all this when I did the big dependency cleanup a few months ago.

I think it makes sense to remove `transitive=false` in as many cases as possible and not try to exclude in every little case of a jar not being used. I understand this is sensitive in \"core\", but once #324 is merged, I think it would make sense to remove `transitive=false`. \r\n\r\nI'm currently looking into this a bit more especially in the contrib/modules where a lot of the `transitive=false` means we have constraints in `versions.props` that we don't need to keep track of any more. I think overall it simplifies our dependency tracking story and makes it a lot easier to reason about what is going on.\r\n\r\nI also have a POC about moving to Hadoop shaded client to avoid a ton of the dependency nightmare that HDFS has been. This should also happen post moving HDFS support to contrib/module. The hadoop auth stuff can't easily use the shaded dependencies, but hadoop auth stuff in Solr is relatively contained compared to the HDFS dependencies.\r\n\r\n@dsmiley do you agree that once HDFS is a contrib/module - then don't need to worry as much about the exclusions? I'm perfectly ok waiting until PR #324 is merged to finish this clean up. I think that PR #324 is pretty close to mergable based on talking with @warperwolf - he had some improvements about test configs there, but I don't think we should keep kicking the can down the road on that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1022521366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1022539143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/529#issuecomment-1022539143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/529","id":1022539143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM488rWH","user":{"login":"Caa52","id":42794279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzk0Mjc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42794279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52","html_url":"https://github.com/Caa52","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caa52/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-26T19:40:44Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T19:40:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This PR was closed in favor of the new one #566 which is a continuation of this one.

A better solution could be to modify the test classes of the HDFS module to point to the resource files in the core's test-files directory, however the test base classes like SolrTestCaseJ4 load resources through the class loader (so that they end up being loaded from the build/resources/test directory of the module we are testing at the moment), and this resource loading seems to occur at various locations, so it would take some time to tweak these.  For now I'd suggest going with this resource copying solution and change the tests later in a separate ticket. (File copying occurs only on hdfs test execution, and this resolves the original issue of having to maintain 2 set of resource files in git.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1022685028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1022722443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/558#issuecomment-1022722443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/558","id":1022722443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM489YGL","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T00:15:49Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T00:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> +1 thanks!
