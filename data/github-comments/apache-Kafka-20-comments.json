How we establish identity is irrelevant to the authorizer because as long as authorizer gets some identity we have enough testing around it to ensure it will do the authorization correctly.

I think renaming could help. In the distributed Copycat patch, the equivalent just has different semantics -- the WorkerRebalanceListener.onRevoked method is only invoked if you actually _owned_ something that needed to be revoked. \n\nI think in the consumer we've just been leaning on the the fact that the empty assignment list from the subscriptions generally makes this work ok (whereas in Copycat you'd get a null pointer exception if you hadn't gone through the join process yet).\n\nIn any case, that shouldn't block this patch, just some additional thoughts on it since these are all related.

I found the following in [the log](http://jenkins.confluent.io/job/kafka_system_tests/ws/results/2015-10-26--001/CopycatDistributedFileTest/test_file_source_and_sink/CopycatDistributedService/worker4/copycat.log/*view*/) from the [failed test](http://jenkins.confluent.io/job/kafka_system_tests/ws/results/2015-10-26--001/):\n\n```\n[2015-10-26 07:18:58,865] INFO Joined group and got assignment: Assignment{error=0, leader='12368506-92ce-4a11-a096-d2988b00b9f3', offset=6, connectorIds=[local-file-source, local-file-sink], taskIds=[]} (org.apache.kafka.copycat.runtime.distributed.DistributedHerder:614)\n[2015-10-26 07:20:22,572] INFO Copycat stopping (org.apache.kafka.copycat.runtime.Copycat:64)\n```\n\nIt looks like the worker joined the group, got an assignment, but then didn't do anything with it. Eventually the test ended and it was shut down.\n\nI think what happened is that the rejoin happened in the call to `member.poll()`. Since this happens before the `selector.poll()` and now actually using that assignment is deferred, if we have a large timeout on the `poll()`, we might get this assignment and then sleep in the poll for a long time. Instead, we should make sure we always trigger a wakeup to ensure we immediately process the assignment.\n\n@hachikuji Wouldn't mind a sanity check & review from you
