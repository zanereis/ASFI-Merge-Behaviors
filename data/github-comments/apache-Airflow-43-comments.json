Execution dates refer to the _start_ of a period; Airflow won't actually run the dag until the period is over. It's easier to see with a daily dag: the 4/12/2016 run won't commence until just after midnight on 4/13/2016. In other words, when the day represented by 4/12/2016 is completely past. \n\nIn your case, we are still in the weekly interval starting on 4/12/2016 and lasting until 4/19/16. I would expect that on 4/19/16, your DAG will fire with the 4/12/16 execution date.\n\nThis can be very confusing with intervals of longer than 1 day because the \"execution_date\" is not actually the day it gets executed... however it is a very difficult thing to change at this stage.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/209984846/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/210002983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1376#issuecomment-210002983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1376","id":210002983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDAwMjk4Mw==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T15:26:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T15:26:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Relates

@mistercrunch. It was my fault, I was confused when testing _backfill _and _scheduler _and I didn't interpret the documentation in the right way.\n\nAnyway I still have a doubt. Is there a workaround so you can trigger a weekly DAG and not being one week before the scheule? I am pretty sure that this could be implemented with daily schedule and branch operators but I wonder if there is a cleaner solution.\n\nThank you very much all of you for your help and for making

@mistercrunch . The issue is that subdag operators keep their slot and call \"run\" that uses a backfilljob and then waits for this process to complete, keeping its slot the entire time. Imho the subdag should not call \"run\", but should do a schedule. This allows the subdag to return right away and clear its slot. \n\nFurthermore, I consider being able to specify the executor on the subdag operator an issue as it allows someone to go beyond the resources that have been assigned by ops (ie. this is known and marked as such in the docs). However, by specifying the executor you can essentially tie the dag to a node and make it possible to share data via, eg. /tmp . I think that should be solved differently. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/210568075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/210568590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1387#issuecomment-210568590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1387","id":210568590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDU2ODU5MA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T18:07:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T18:07:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/5806327/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/5806327)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.1%) to 67.836% when pulling **923c77aea612f6e62d473778ab143e1e37a17ebc on jgao54:cli-variable-support** into **499a8d2a23b52968d2dd574f7ae0cc05f0b026b8 on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/210568590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/210576930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1365#issuecomment-210576930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1365","id":210576930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDU3NjkzMA==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T18:26:42Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T18:26:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@garthcn ping.
