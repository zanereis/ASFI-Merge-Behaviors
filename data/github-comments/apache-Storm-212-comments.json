Netty's Channel queues up written data on an unbounded buffer. The background flushing seems to have been added to avoid this, but in practice it was probably doing it anyways because flushMessages(), which is called by send() doesn't check for isWritable. Moreover, queuing on an unbounded buffer seems fine because back pressure is provided by MAX_PENDING_TUPLE. If OOME occurs due to this buffer overflowing, it seems reasonable that one has to reduce MAX_PENDING_TUPLE, rather than Storm trying to cope with it by dropping messages.</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612900407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/215259583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1371#issuecomment-215259583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1371","id":215259583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTI1OTU4Mw==","user":{"login":"dsKarthick","id":1086011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODYwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1086011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick","html_url":"https://github.com/dsKarthick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsKarthick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T23:08:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T23:08:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Invalid.
