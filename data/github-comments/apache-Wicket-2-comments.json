of the issue with the 6.9.0 release and the revert for 6.9.1 I added the ability to enable and disable the anonymous and non-static inner class injection by having the AbstractCdiContainer implementation verify the feature is supported.  In the cdi-weld package, the WeldCdiContainer class checks the specification-version in the manifest of the jar containing WeldBootstrap.class.  If the value is 2.0.2.Final or later the support for anonymous and non-static inner class injection is enabled.  If the version is less than 2.0.2.Final the support is disabled. Also added ability to disable it regardless of version by including the proper init params to the CdiWicketFilter.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/20630554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/20630820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/49#issuecomment-20630820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/49","id":20630820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjMwODIw","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-08T19:44:54Z","updated_at":"2013-07-08T19:44:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't think this is needed.\nWicket 7 will be released in few months.

I say we leave it until Glassfish4\nis well past sp1. Once sp1 is non longer used then we can just remove it.\n This is the nice part of leaving it in the experimental package IMO. Also\nthe pattern to implement that feature is also designed to expose container\nspecific features in the future. I designed it as it is to have a mechanism\nto allow the core to ask the implementation for support of container\nspecific features.  When openwebbeans supports cdi 1.1 we may have to\nhandle some things slightly different and it is nice to already have the\ncode to do that.\n\nOn Mon, Jul 8, 2013 at 3:44 PM, Martin Grigorov notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I don't think this is needed.\n> Wicket 7 will be released in few months.

After all app servers have update weld-impl then remove it\nfully.\n\n+1 leave it for now remove it when no longer needed.\n\nNo opinion on init-param option just added it so developer could disable it\nfor whatever reason.\n\nJohn\n\nOn Mon, Jul 8, 2013 at 5:43 PM, Igor Vaynberg notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> it is very common to factor out non-trivial components into inner classes.\n> for example, ShoppingCartPage might have BuyButton, ClearAllButton,\n> UpdateButton, etc as inner non-static classes. depending on how big they\n> are sometimes its easier to inject dependencies directly into them because\n> its easier to track when looking at code. sometimes buttons need\n> dependencies that only they use, so it again makes sense to inject the\n> button directly. yet, other times it actually makes a difference which\n> class you inject:\n> \n> public class CartPage extends WebPage {\n>    class BuyButton extends Button {\n> \n> ```\n>   @Inject Logger logger;\n> \n>   onSubmit() {\n>    // do submit stuff\n>    logger.info(\"..\");\n>   }\n> ```\n> \n>   }\n> }\n> \n> i want the logger to use the BuyButton class name as the category instead\n> of the CartPage so i have to inject it into BuyButton.\n> \n> anyways, it is very common to have a lot of complex anonymous and inner\n> classes as wicket components - after all thats the point of wicket.\n> \n> -1 on the enable/disable part.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/49#issuecomment-20638381\n> .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/20639075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/20640367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/49#issuecomment-20640367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/49","id":20640367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQwMzY3","user":{"login":"ivaynberg","id":150030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg","html_url":"https://github.com/ivaynberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivaynberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-08T22:16:14Z","updated_at":"2013-07-08T22:16:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i would rip it out. it should fail loudly on app-servers with broken support. otherwise it will be a big surprise when someone tries to deploy an existing app on glassfish.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/20640367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/20644838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/49#issuecomment-20644838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/49","id":20644838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQ0ODM4","user":{"login":"jsarman","id":1319705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk3MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1319705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman","html_url":"https://github.com/jsarman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsarman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-08T23:56:37Z","updated_at":"2013-07-08T23:56:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The check is now removed.

Nothing broke just allows for\npage level reconfiguration.\n\nOn Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 4:56 PM, Igor Vaynberg notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> my primary concern is the removal of features like auto conversations. i\n> know you are still working on a fix, but its not done yet. i do not want\n> to\n> lose any functionality.\n> \n> my second concern is that a lot of code has changed and no one went\n> through\n> it to see if it aligns with how we do things. i found a lot of instances\n> where it does not.\n> \n> my third concern is that the api has somewhat changed. i dont really see a\n> reason for that unless its really necessary.\n> \n> ideally the pull requests wouldve gone like this (had they i mightve had\n> time to review them a lot sooner):\n> - clone wicket-cdi into wicket-cdi-1.1+weld. minimal changes to remove\n>   seam\n>   module conversation management and replace with weld-dependent interfaces.\n> - refactor auto-conversation management api, i noticed you were doing some\n>   of that in your changes, but they are too messy (code formatting tweaks)\n>   and too mixed in with everything else to clearly see what you were trying\n>   to accomplish\n> - refactor to allow management of application using cdi lifecycle.\n> \n> if they were separated like that we can easily follow and\n> apply/reject/refine your changes individually. as it stands now its more\n> of\n> a all or nothing approach...\n> \n> -igor\n> \n> On Fri, Nov 8, 2013 at 1:35 PM, John Sarman notifications@github.comwrote:\n> \n> > Igor,\n> > In our conversations throughout the day I thought it was about my early\n> > pulls, because my latest pull request could not properly merged.
