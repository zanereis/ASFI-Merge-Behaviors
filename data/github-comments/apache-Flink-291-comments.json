For utils, I grep classes and find only `org.apache.flink.docs.util.Utils` and `org.apache.flink.runtime.client.ClientUtils` follow this pattern.\r\n2. The cost is neither enormous nor frequent. A utils implemented using `enum` is compiled ~500 Byte bigger than `final class` with `private constructor` version.\r\n\r\nI open this pull request for an option that reduce a bit of the cost of abstraction(we need utils, but using `enum` also introduced extra `name`, `ordinal` fields and methods). Nevertheless, I don't insist this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/455491916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/455495120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7523#issuecomment-455495120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7523","id":455495120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTQ5NTEyMA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T10:11:35Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T10:11:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review @zentol.

I have went through all production code using union state as below:\r\n\r\nFor `ArtificalOperatorStateMapper`, `SimpleEndlessSourceWithBloatedState `, and `StateCreatingFlatMap`, they just use union state for end-to-end test verifying. \r\n\r\nFor `FlinkKafkaProducer` and `FlinkKafkaProducer011`, the union `nextTransactionalIdHintState` is just the same for all sub-tasks.\r\n\r\nFor `KafkaConsumer`, since Kafaka does support to decrease partition counts, the kafka partition is sticky to the subtask  when parallslism not changed.\r\n\r\nI think above operators would not meet conflict case.\r\n\r\nFor `SequenceGeneratorSource`, it would initialize state with max event time. However, `monotonousEventTime` only increase by fixed step of `eventTimeClockProgressPerEvent`, which should be the same for all sub-tasks.\r\n\r\nFor `StreamingFileSink`, it also get the max counter, but from the defination of `StreamingFileSink`, when restoring from checkpoint, the restored files in `pending` state are transferred into `finished` state, while `in-progress` files are rolled back. In other words from my point, partial recovery is not suitable for `StreamingFileSink`.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, all operators in production code with union state, except `StreamingFileSink`, should work fine for partial restore. However, since the `getUnionList` API is public for users, we cannot control users' behavior. In a nutshell, if we support to restore state when using `RestartPipelinedRegionStrategy`, we should add limitation for union state.\r\n\r\nI plan to add another parameter, which might be `RecoveryMode`, in the `restoreLatestCheckpointedState` method. For `RestartAllStrategy` and overall only one region's `RestartPipelinedRegionStrategy`, it's `RecoveryMode.ALL`; for other failover strategies, it's `RecoveryMode.PARTIAL`. By means of this, when assigning state, if we found `RecoveryMode.PARTIAL` and union state existed, unsupported exception could be thrown out.
