The bug here is that if you don't do `statement.setMaxRows`, some drivers (eg postgres) will try to load everything when you issue a `select *`. Using `setFetchSize` won't affect that (I tested it). So the solution I found is to set the limit to (fetch size + 1). There's a function that will prune the results *after they're back from JDBC* (`getResults`) - I'm guessing we could remove that, if all it did was checking that limit, but don't think it's worth pursuing at this time.\r\n\r\nTLDR - the current limit check is only applied _after_ you get results. If you query a big enough table, you'll never get the results (and will kill Zeppelin in the process)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/312090314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/312144097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2438#issuecomment-312144097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2438","id":312144097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjE0NDA5Nw==","user":{"login":"soralee","id":8110458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8110458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee","html_url":"https://github.com/soralee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soralee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-30T00:38:09Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T00:38:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready

The diagram is correct. One interpreter process would have only one InterperterGroup, and InterpreterGroup have one session for shared/isolated mode, and multiple sessions for scoped mode.

At the beginning there's no concept of session, at that time InterpreterGroup represent a container of interpreters, and later zeppelin introduce the scoped mode, so introduce the concept of session.
