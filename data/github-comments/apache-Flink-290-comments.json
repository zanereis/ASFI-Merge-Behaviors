For example, KafkaConsumer \"abuses\" union state to have a rescaling protocol that can support partition discovery. In a nutshell, during restore all parallel instances see the kafka offsets of all partitions and every instance will cherrypick kafka partitions through a protocoll that all instances follow. So every partition will go to exactly one operator and there is no need for communication between instances for that.\r\n\r\nThe contract of union state is that in recovery, each operator instance sees the union of states from all instances. The question for partial recovery is now, will recoverying instances see i) all states, ii) all states from other recovering instances, or iii) only their old state. I think most likely, we should go for option i), but this also means that all states would have to go into the operation and cannot be excluded via the index.\r\n\r\nThen there is another problem in the current implementation that can lead to bugs with your code in the following way: if there is at least one union state, all other operator states will go through round-robin reassignment as well. So, we round-robin reassign some state, but only restarting operators load the reassigned version of the state. Instances that we keep running will run with the old assignment of the state. This can lead to some partitions beeing assigned twice or not being assigned at all. \r\n\r\nOne way to solve this problem would be to separate union states from other operator states and only round-robin assign operator state if the parallelism did not change (which it never does for recoveries, only for restarts).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/453954020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/453978906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7471#issuecomment-453978906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7471","id":453978906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzk3ODkwNg==","user":{"login":"klion26","id":1425623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjU2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1425623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26","html_url":"https://github.com/klion26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klion26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T11:47:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T11:47:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@intsmaze Thank you for your contribution! maybe you could describe the pr title more clearly.

Even if we could assign partitioned operator state to all operator instances, the current `taskRestore` within `Execution` could only be shipped to taskmanagers if those executions located in the failed region.  And instances that we keep running would not know operator states have changed. The possible bug \"`This can lead to some partitions beeing assigned twice or not being assigned at all`\" you mentioned is more likely on execution-graph side, and how we define the 'disunity' among tasks?\r\n\r\n1. The last suggestion you provide seems a bit confused for me, please correct me if I am wrong, did you actually mean only round-robin assign operator state if parallelism **did change**? The parallelism could only be changed if job restarted, while it would not change during job fail-over.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/454098941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/454185301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7486#issuecomment-454185301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7486","id":454185301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDE4NTMwMQ==","user":{"login":"GJL","id":1681921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1681921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL","html_url":"https://github.com/GJL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T22:26:23Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T22:26:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

Yes, that is correct. We need to doublecheck for operators that use union state if their protocol also works for partial restores.
