The only feedback the client gets right now is in the Physical plan, that this filter is pushed down to Iceberg Scan level and if the client inspects the Scan (using  ` iceTable.newScan().filter(structFilterExp).planFiles ` ) , should be able to notice the appropriate files being skipped.

Take `HiveTables` implementation for example, because create needs to be implemented the `HiveTables` implementation  makes metastore calls and creates the table in HMS. But for other table level operations like rename and drop the client is expected to manage it outside of iceberg. This means any iceberg clients now needs to create wrappers on top of Tables implementation. \r\n\r\nWhat is the downside of offering these APIs as part of iceberg?

This uses 120? Do we want to go with that?\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Google Style Guide wants the column limit to be 100 characters: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.4-column-limit\r\n\r\nBut Baseline wants 120: https://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline/blob/develop/docs/java-style-guide/readme.md#column-limit-120.\r\n\r\nI've always found in my coding that 100 characters is far too short, even for Scala (when building on Spark), much less so for Java which is more verbose.

Also, it would be 8 spaces in projects that use 4 spaces as a base for indentation.). But, notably, Baseline checkstyle does _not_ enforce a hard rule on this. I did some brief searching on Google and Checkstyle doesn't have a built-in rule for this, so we'd have to write one ourselves. Sounds a bit involved.

I'm fine with either one as long as we enforce something. 120 is probably a better choice because there are cases where merges and refactors have accidentally created longer lines. I think we will have fewer changes to standardize if we use 120.\r\n\r\n> Checkstyle doesn't have a built-in rule for this, so we'd have to write one ourselves. Sounds a bit involved.\r\n\r\nMy vote is to set some reasonable guidelines and not worry about it.\r\n\r\nHere's what I would do for this project:\r\n\r\n1. If all arguments etc. fit on one line, leave it that way\r\n2. If not, start a new line for arguments at 2 indents / 4 spaces from the start of the method definition (e.g. `public`)\r\n3. When the argument line is full, start a new one at 2 indents / 4 spaces\r\n\r\nThat would look like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public void shortMethodArgs(int foo) throws IOException {\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public void longMethodArgs(\r\n      Map<String, String> properties1, Map<String, String> properties2,\r\n      Map<String, String> properties3) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't really care for the Spark style that puts one arg on every line. It wastes a lot of vertical space.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/475756415/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/475757416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/143#issuecomment-475757416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/143","id":475757416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTc1NzQxNg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-22T19:48:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-22T19:48:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One more comment on line length: I checked the default view for github and it looks like 120 doesn't cause horizontal scrolling, which would be bad.

I think you have the right approach, but some things are missing.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, `BoundReference` has the correct type and field ID. That works for `InclusiveMetricsEvaluator` and the Parquet filters that look up data based on ID. But it isn't enough for other evaluators that require binding:\r\n\r\n* `Evaluator` calls `BoundReference.get` to get a value from a `StructLike`. That method needs to be updated to handle struct nesting, preferably using an [`Accessor`](https://github.com/rdblue/iceberg/blob/support-predicates-on-nested-fields/api/src/main/java/com/netflix/iceberg/expressions/BoundReference.java#L61-L217) (that's an unfinished branch of mine working on this problem). As it is now, evaluators would fail because `get` will try to access position -1 for any nested field.\r\n* `InclusiveManifestEvaluator` uses `BoundReference.pos` to get the correct `PartitionFieldSummary` from a `ManifestFile` instance. The partition field summaries are stored in the order of partition fields, so binding to the partition struct gives the correct position in the field summaries list. I think this would actually work because all fields are top-level, but I think there should be a better signal than returning -1.\r\n\r\nThis should also bind differently. We never parse identifiers in Iceberg. Instead of parsing, we build indexes using the possible field names. That way, we never have to worry about quoting.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user passes in an expression for `\"a.b.c\"`, that could mean multiple paths: `[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]` or `[\"a.b\", \"c\"]` or `[\"a\", \"b.c\"]` or `[\"a.b.c\"]`. But the important thing is that there can be only one column that flattens to \"a.b.c\" because the columns are ambiguous otherwise. Rather than searching, we keep a map in the schema from \"a.b.c\" to the right field ID.\r\n\r\nExpression binding should use an index like the ones used by `Schema` and then build accessors using the actual path of field names.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/475823022/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/475834931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/144#issuecomment-475834931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/144","id":475834931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTgzNDkzMQ==","user":{"login":"xiao-chen","id":14279024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjc5MDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14279024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen","html_url":"https://github.com/xiao-chen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiao-chen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-23T03:21:36Z","updated_at":"2019-03-23T03:21:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Came across [this comment in spec doc](https://docs.google.com/a/netflix.com/document/d/1Q-zL5lSCle6NEEdyfiYsXYzX_Q8Qf0ctMyGBKslOswA/edit?disco=uiAAAACIlCSbM) that seems to be a good first issue.\r\n\r\nI can't find a great way to add a unit test for it, but open to any suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/475834931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/475999644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/117#issuecomment-475999644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/117","id":475999644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTk5OTY0NA==","user":{"login":"rominparekh","id":3831468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzE0Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3831468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh","html_url":"https://github.com/rominparekh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rominparekh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-24T21:01:32Z","updated_at":"2019-03-24T21:01:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue - I've incorporated your latest feedback and resolved conflicts.
