The issues [you've documented](https://github.com/alopresto/nifi/blob/276f31aa85d9ec401fb34f939238c6646e187ae6/nifi-docs/src/main/asciidoc/user-guide.adoc#potential-issues) did occur (where switching between configuration would lead to errors in the log and when querying).  However I'm wondering two things:\r\n\r\n1) Can there be a friendlier error message in the logs for those errors? I saw lots of errors around ClassCastException between the old and new Record Readers. Just wondering if NiFi could simply say detected a mismatch and that it could be due to a change in repo providers?\r\n\r\n2) I also saw the UI error (see below), however I expected to eventually be able to retrieve the events that were subject to encryption yet I am unable to. I have a super short and small flow that runs every 10s. Perhaps provenance hasn't been completely overwritten with the newer encrypted files in my case but each time I attempt to query provenance I get the ClassCastException.  I also tried changing my search query to a smaller window after I made the change however I still encountered the error.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1371858/25546889/efea31b6-2c32-11e7-9a98-ac78cc95c1bb.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1371858/25546896/f597cad8-2c32-11e7-8502-18d9af37db32.png)\r\n\r\nIf

Thanks Yolanda. \r\n\r\nDuring most of my testing, I did clear the repositories between application starts when switching the implementation (`rm -rf provenance_repository/ content_repository/ flowfile_repository/` from `$NIFI_HOME/conf`). I did run tests (at the time) where I left the repository intact (in each direction) and my notes are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t-Verified switching from encrypted prov repo to plain will not allow access to previously-written events\r\n\t\t-Error in app log\r\n\t\t\t-Suppress stacktrace?\r\n\t\t-App still starts\r\n\t\t-UI error dialog on prov query\r\n\t\t-New provenance events overwrite previous\r\n\t\t-New prov queries work\r\n\t-Verified switching from plain prov repo to encrypted will not allow access to previously-written events\r\n\t\t-Error in app log\r\n\t\t\t-Suppress stacktrace?\r\n\t\t-App still starts\r\n\t\t-UI error dialog on prov query\r\n\t\t-New provenance events overwrite previous\r\n\t\t-New prov queries work\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will re-evaluate those scenarios as soon as I finish reviewing PR 1712 for Bryan. \r\n\r\nI do think suppressing the stacktrace and providing a more descriptive error is a good idea and will tackle that as well. If it is determined there is a simple reason your queries were not working, great. If not, adding documentation instructing repository removal may be necessary.

I believe the difference is that when I tested and did not clear the existing provenance repository, I was switching between `EncryptedWriteAheadProvenanceRepository` and `WriteAheadProvenanceRepository` which both use a `SchemaRecordReader` that can be cross-cast (`EncryptedRecordSchemaReader` extends `EventIdFirstRecordSchemaReader`), so the class cast exception wasn't occurring. However, if you test by first using `PersistentProvenanceRepository`, this uses `ByteArraySchemaRecordReader`, which implements the same `RecordReader` interface but cannot be cast. As `PersistentProvenanceRepository` is the existing option that most people will be using, production switch over will encounter this issue. I will try to improve this user experience (opening a separate sub-task to do that). For now, I've included documentation in [NIFI-3721](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3721) (see [commit 2361ef0\r\n](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1713/commits/2361ef02eab2aca763d337236e7d2c2ddebfc7ea)) stating that the existing repository should be erased when switching (as this is a new feature and backward-compatibility is not yet provided).

There were test errors in `nifi-gcp-processors` and `nifi-poi-processors` where `MockComponentLog#getErrorMessages()` was returning twice the number of expected errors. With @bbende , we determined this was because `src/test/resources/logback-test.xml` in `nifi-data-provenance-utils` set the log level to `DEBUG`, and `MockComponentLog` double records the error message if `DEBUG` is enabled. I provided custom `src/test/resources/logback-test.xml` files in the two offending modules to ensure that the log level is set as expected when those tests run. \r\n\r\nMerged.
