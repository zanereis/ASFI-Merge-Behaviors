Okay, a little clarification. \r\nFirst, i sent 100 messages. It was fine. Athena also showed 100 records\r\nNext I sent 100 new messages + 25 updates + 25 duplicates of previous 100 messages. In total there are 250 messages in Kafka but Athena showed only 247. Irrespective of inserts, duplicates or updates, I am assuming that the connector should append the messages. \r\nLater on, I continued sending several rounds of messages and found that the count did not match. Few records were missing (somewhere between 20 -50) for around 500-600 messages sent to Kafka. I made this test several times And each time, there were some missing records. \r\nI tested with CoW too, it also had missing records. The no.of records in Athena was always less than no.of messages in Kafka ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1191910129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1191928572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5954#issuecomment-1191928572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5954","id":1191928572,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5HC2L8","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-21T20:58:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T20:58:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@codope looks like IT still fails after rerunning.
