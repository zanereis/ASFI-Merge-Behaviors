Normally for a Hudi table, we'd like to monitor all kinds of metrics named like `<prefix>.<hudi table>.*`, and aggregate over `<prefix>.<hudi table>.<a fixed hudi metric>` for sum, avg, p95, etc. If metric name becomes `<prefix>.<hudi table>_i.<a fixed hudi metric>`, then the aggregation is not possible, which is undesirable.\r\n> \r\n> Haven't thought about the solution yet. Just trying to raise the concern.\r\n> cc @leesf\r\n\r\nThanks @xushiyan for your thoughts, yes, current solution will send metrics like `<prefix>.<hudi table>_i.<a fixed hudi metric>`, is it suitable to change to `<prefix>.<hudi table>.<i>.<a fixed hudi metric>`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/640034374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/640034575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1679#issuecomment-640034575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1679","id":640034575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDAzNDU3NQ==","user":{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-06T10:36:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T10:36:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@selvarajperiyasamy : Hope you were able to resolve the issue.

Say a user runs a delta streamer, he denotes the job with prefix `foo`, and the job writes to a Hudi table `bar`. He wants to monitor a metric named `deltastreamer.duration`. So the final metric name is `foo.bar.deltastreamer.duration`. A monitoring system normally aggregates the emitted values for the same metric name. Aggregation like `avg()` won't work if delta streamer emits values for different metric named like `foo.bar_1.deltastreamer.duration`, `foo.bar_2.deltastreamer.duration`, and so on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/640146574/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/640158649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1705#issuecomment-640158649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1705","id":640158649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDE1ODY0OQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T05:14:42Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T05:14:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That’s a larger book :).. can you please each explain your use case in more detail","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/640158649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/640243834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1705#issuecomment-640243834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1705","id":640243834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDI0MzgzNA==","user":{"login":"nandini57","id":40003951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDAzOTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40003951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57","html_url":"https://github.com/nandini57","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandini57/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T16:26:10Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T16:29:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"haha.

I was also looking into whether we can use a single spark context for the entire test run.. Nonetheless.. Would love some helping hand with the test situation currently.. We need to get CI back stable again, so we can merge with confidence..\r\n\r\nMy thought: Can we distinguish the objects of `HoodieClientTestHarness` into **weight** and **light** level? For example, `JavaSparkContext` and `MiniDFSCluster` can be considered as the weight objects. Then we can initialize them via `ClassRule` or `Rule` mode?
