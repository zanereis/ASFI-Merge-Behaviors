for your proposal @wayilau. It's a great idea to operate SW backend(OAP/UI) in both VM and Kubernetes with the same standard.\r\nI want to pick up CRDs as our final solution of CLI interaction, which is an alternative to Web UI. Because it's the future, and I desire to follow it closely. But the concern is also the \"future\", well, it didn't come though. Most developers/operators aren't familiar with Kubernetes, not to CRDs.\r\nAnother reason is SkyWalking is being used by operators in most cases, this user group prefer an easier way to figure out their jobs. A K8S way will bring much more complex and chaos to them.\r\nSo my suggestion is hiding K8S and VM behind SWCLI, then users don't need to care about on which platform they're working. It is not some new idea, and some successful project has followed this way, for instance, Istio.\r\n\r\nAnd for CRDs, I would like to put it into operator, controller, and sidecar injection. The Kubernetes community of SkyWalking focus on making SkyWalking in Kubernetes to work better than other platforms instead of replacing them, which empower the Kubernetes to attract more and more users to work on
