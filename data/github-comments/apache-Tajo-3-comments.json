I replied for your descriptions as follows:\n- I've just fixed NPE in the web UI via Hyunsik. Because my desktop has broken down.\n- DerbyStore is not appropriate for TajoMaster HA. As you know, just one tajo master invoke the store. If another master try to invoke it, it never run itself. Also, if we set another catalog uri for backup master, it is a incorrect configuration. Because they are unequal in every way.\n- If you run two masters on same host and you set same directory for pid, you must meet pid error. But I think that it is trivial problem. Because we can avoid easily by documents. \n- If backup master become active, existing running query will finish successfully, and you will see success message in tsql. But you will never find executed query history in the web UI. Because TajoMaster contains its query history in memory, thus backup master can't know previous active master information. I already know this problem. And I'll save query simple history in share storage (like HDFS). \n  \n  For reference, I'll write documents for TajoMaster HA. And I'll update start-tajo.sh to start backup masters. \n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/50131715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/50231900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/95#issuecomment-50231900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/95","id":50231900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjMxOTAw","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-26T11:42:53Z","updated_at":"2014-07-26T11:42:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\nThe

If you use the old way, you can see the deprecation warning.\n\n```\nTry \\? for help.\ndefault> \\set tajo.dist-query.join.broadcast.threshold-bytes 50000\nWarning: deprecated to directly use config key in TajoConf.ConfVars. Please execute '\\help set'.\n```\n\nBut, the conf key automatically is replaced by new key corresponding to the conf key.\n\n```\ndefault> \\set\n'BROADCAST_TABLE_SIZE_LIMIT'='50000'\n'CURRENT_DATABASE'='default'\n'SESSION_ID'='1a104a50-3f8d-4bac-a8a2-5a8efc936298'\n'USERNAME'='hyunsik'\n'SESSION_LAST_ACCESS_TIME'='1407388966573'\n```\n\nAlso, I've added the help command and its alias.
