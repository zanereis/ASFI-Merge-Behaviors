Since you haven't given the slash in your `destination_object`, it is not being added in the final destination.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep in mind that in GCS, just like in S3, objects are not actually put into \"directories\" -- object names are simple strings which are for convenience treated as directories if their names include slashes. Therefore, constructing an object's name should not assume that the goal is to add a \"directory\"; a slash is just another character in the name.\r\n\r\nTo take your example, if your `destination_object` included a trailing slash -- `example_3_copy/` -- the original behaviour would produce e.g. `gs://bucket1/example_3_copy//usa_names_1910_current_000000000000.avro`; and in GCS two slashes do not get conflated to one as in a filesystem. Instead, your GCS console would show an extra level of \"directory\" with an empty string for the name.\r\n\r\nNot presuming the use of \"directories\" also makes things more flexible -- it is easier to add a wanted slash in `destination_object` than to remove an unwanted one added by the operator.\r\n\r\nBasically, using `destination_object` with the wildcard replaces the prefix (the part before the wildcard) with the `destination_object`; if the former ends with `/` so should the latter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/388801910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/388806757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3355#issuecomment-388806757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3355","id":388806757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODgwNjc1Nw==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-14T12:56:31Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T12:57:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree with you on some aspects.
