(Or be modified with an explanation of why they are being modified)  Drill is a very complex beast with a lot of dependencies so even small changes can break things you didn't intend to.  Believe me... I know from experience ;-)\r\n\r\nOne other thing to note is that there is another option `drill.exec.functions.cast_empty_string_to_null`.  Setting this to true forces empty strings to be treated as `null`.  This can have some unintended side effects,  but might also help you out.

With that its not a big problem to work with both types of parquet timestamps, but since that spark uses INT96 as default, you have to switch this configure in almost all situations, especially when working with new lakehouse architectures like deltalake and iceberg.\n> \n> For spark its clearly documented that they use INT96 in all scenarios:\n> \n> here for reading -> https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-parquet.html\n> \n> Some Parquet-producing systems, in particular Impala and Hive, store Timestamp into INT96.

INT96 is a non-standard but commonly used timestamp type in Parquet. TIMESTAMP_MICROS is a standard timestamp type in Parquet, which stores number of microseconds from the Unix epoch. TIMESTAMP_MILLIS is also standard, but with millisecond precision, which means Spark has to truncate the microsecond portion of its timestamp value.\n> \n> Of course we could advise every drill user to write its spark jobs with the configuration spark.sql.parquet.outputTimestampType to TIMESTAMP_MICROS or TIMESTAMP_MILLIS or always toggle this drill configuration after startup, but its still an additional step.\n> \n> @vvysotskyi <https://github.com/vvysotskyi> mentioned that if we would switch this default now, we would have issues with some UDF´s, so i would think it could be a topic for upcomming Drill 2.0.0 as a breaking change.\n> \n> What do you think?\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2746>, or unsubscribe <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABKB7PTKHEOHFBSTC433NIDWVJMIHANCNFSM6AAAAAAUNV7C5Y>.\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1412101491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1412173964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2746#issuecomment-1412173964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2746","id":1412173964,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5ULBCM","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T14:43:33Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T14:43:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm a -1 at this point.
