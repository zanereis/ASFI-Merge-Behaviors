them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1435955811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1436854911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2555#issuecomment-1436854911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2555","id":1436854911,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85VpKp_","user":{"login":"SvenRoederer","id":1755362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTUzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer","html_url":"https://github.com/SvenRoederer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SvenRoederer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-20T11:55:03Z","updated_at":"2023-02-20T11:55:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"WOuld

I'm not sure whether I interpret the results, especially the failures, correctly:\r\n\r\n* the \"Build / lib-go (1.19)\" and \"Build / lib-go (1.20)\" runs fail/are cancelled. There is something about a missing `go.sum` file in the logs. I'll assume that this is not related to my change?\r\n* The \"Build / cross-test\" build is skipped, I assume as a result of lib-go not being built?\r\n\r\n* The AppVeyor build fails. That's the one where I'm not sure whether I am at fault. I see three failed builds, two of them with MSVC, one with MinGW. I do have MSVC on my machine, however I have been developing/building/testing Thrift under Linux via WSL1, using GCC and Clang. Maybe I need to set up an MSVC build. See below for details on the three failed builds. However, if I look at the AppVeyor builds of [the latest commit on the master branch](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/thrift/builds/46540784), it seems to me that these are the exact same three errors. So, I also assume that my changes have nothing to do with these errors.\r\n\r\n## Failed AppVeyor Builds\r\n* For the first AppVeyor build, I don't see any error. These are the last lines in the log:\r\n```\r\n  Building Custom Rule C:/projects/thrift/lib/cpp/test/CMakeLists.txt\r\n  ProcessorTest.cpp\r\n  EventLog.cpp\r\n  ServerThread.cpp\r\n  Generating Code...\r\n  processor_test.vcxproj -> C:\\projects\\build\\MSVC2017\\x64\\bin\\Release\\processor_test.exe\r\n  Command exited with code 1\r\n```\r\n  This is weird. Usually, MSVC does print an error if it fails to compile / link something…\r\n  * For the second build, the log is similar but warns about a library compatibility problem:\r\n```\r\n  Building Custom Rule C:/projects/thrift/lib/cpp/test/CMakeLists.txt\r\n  ProcessorTest.cpp\r\n  EventLog.cpp\r\n  ServerThread.cpp\r\n  Generating Code...\r\nLINK : warning LNK4098: defaultlib 'LIBCMT' conflicts with use of other libs; use /NODEFAULTLIB:library [C:\\projects\\build\\MSVC2015\\x86\\lib\\cpp\\test\\processor_test.vcxproj]\r\n  processor_test.vcxproj -> C:\\projects\\build\\MSVC2015\\x86\\bin\\Debug\\processor_test.exe\r\n  processor_test.vcxproj -> C:/projects/build/MSVC2015/x86/bin/Debug/processor_test.pdb (Full PDB)\r\nCommand exited with code 1\r\n```\r\n* The third build (the MinGW one) fails with undefined references to `boost::unit_test`.

limited).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1502109947/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1502359852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2776#issuecomment-1502359852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2776","id":1502359852,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85ZjDEs","user":{"login":"garymm","id":421339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm","html_url":"https://github.com/garymm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garymm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-10T21:36:34Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T21:36:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":":'-(

I don't think those change very often, so that doesn't really matter.\r\n\r\nMy main concern about doing the Java libs weekly, is that this only really matters for release and release testing, and this project doesn't release very often. So, this can just create a bunch of busy work... bumping dependencies every week, resulting in possibly several dozen bumps between releases. That can get annoying, because one bump during the development period would suffice. Frequent bumps *can* have benefits, in that slowly moving incompatibilities can be fixed more easily in smaller chunks... but more likely, these bumps will merely fix bugs and not create any incompatibilities at all. So, it's just busy work. I would choose a longer duration to match the less frequent release cycle of this project in order to avoid redundant busy work, and more ability to focus on the outstanding PRs that are more important for the project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1507678429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508131776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2784#issuecomment-1508131776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2784","id":1508131776,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Z5EPA","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T08:27:51Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T08:27:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jens-G \r\n\r\n> Don't we have dependabot already?

I'm comfortable with Java, and I t think we can add more languages later on.\r\n\r\n@ctubbsii I see your concern. My argument to that would be that you don't want to do all the updates just before a release as something might have broken you want to know earlier. I would argue that it will reduce the work because you don't have to look up the latest version, and you only have to merge the PR that's being created by Dependabot. As I said, I have seen this work well on other projects, and I would recommend giving it a try.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508131776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508150624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2779#issuecomment-1508150624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2779","id":1508150624,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Z5I1g","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T08:40:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T08:40:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice, thanks for picking this up @Jimexist ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508150624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508747097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1508747097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1508747097,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Z7adZ","user":{"login":"jimexist","id":622789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjc4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist","html_url":"https://github.com/jimexist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimexist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T15:08:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T15:08:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"we kind of removed this not long ago. is there a possibility that downstream projects migrate to java 11?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508747097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1508780726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1508780726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1508780726,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85Z7iq2","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T15:20:15Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T15:21:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jimexist Eventually all projects will migrate, but this isn't the case today.
