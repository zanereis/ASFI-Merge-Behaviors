I'm going to pick up the task for exposing default worker metrics via the Coda Hale API.</p>\n\n<p>For the metrics reporters, I was considering adding wrappers around the existing reporters that would make it easier to configure reporters via Yaml configuration in <tt>storm.yaml</tt>. My reasoning for the wrappers is to provider a bridge to the fluent-style API the reporters currently use for configuration. So the config might look something like this in <tt>storm.yaml</tt>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">storm.metrics.reporters:\n  reporter.class: <span class=\"code-quote\">\"org.apache.storm.metrics2.GraphiteReporter\"</span>\n  config:\n    report.interval.seconds: 60\n    graphite.host: <span class=\"code-quote\">\"localhost\"</span>\n    graphite.port: 2003\n    # more graphite reporter specific config...\n  reporter.class: <span class=\"code-quote\">\"org.apache.storm.metrics2.ConsoleReporter\"</span>\n  config:\n    report.interval.seconds: 60\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>Then each reporter implementation would have a no-args constructor and <tt>prepare(Map<String, Object> config)</tt> method that would receive the above \"config\" map.</p>\n\n<p>Does that align with what you are thinking?</p>\n\n<p>Would you be interested in doing this work in a feature branch to make collaboration easier?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612962993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/258913720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1679#issuecomment-258913720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1679","id":258913720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODkxMzcyMA==","user":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T18:06:40Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T18:06:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2

Current phase would put still pipe metrics through StatsUtil, although I haven't written that part yet (they get to nimbus right now only).</p>\n\n<p>1. Each executor registers metrics against the metric registry running in the worker.<br/>\n2. With the default reporter configured, we'd instantiate that. This is a codahale ScheduledReporter that runs once/min? Currently I go every 5 seconds but that's just for testing.<br/>\n3. The stats are then written to disk on a per component basis, exactly like versioned store. We could swap this part with a better way to store, but that's what I have so far. I call it TimeseriesStore to distinguish, but we could merge the two.<br/>\n4. The supervisor has a timer, I call it WorkerStatsTimer that picks up stats from the stats directory on disk using its instance of TimeseriesStore. This is very much like the heartbeat stuff in the supervisor, except the Supervisor itself doesn't care much for them, it just shuttles them to the thrift connection. The stats are then deleted when pushed, nothing is kept.<br/>\n5. With each iteration of WorkerStatsTimer, we send the metrics for all workers to Nimbus via Thrift.<br/>\n6. For phase I, I was just thinking to take these and make them look like heartbeats stats s.t. the stats code and the UI can show them. Eventually, once the RocksDB stuff is ready we can store there.<br/>\n7. I am looking to publish all data available for Timers and Histograms to see if I can reconstruct later the stats it computes, so that we can look at how to aggregate them. </p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? I am going to take a crack at trying to make this work with our current UI this week, and I should be able to share the code next week. I have to finish up what I doing, write tests and document/clean up quite a bit, but can share before.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612961672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612966684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5976#issuecomment-2612966684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5976","id":2612966684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5NjY2ODQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T00:46:47Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:47:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=chawco\">chawco</a>:</i>\n<p>Just managed to snag a thread dump of a worker I think was exhibiting this behaviour.
