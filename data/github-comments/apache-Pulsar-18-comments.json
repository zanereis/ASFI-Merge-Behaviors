Now, broker will check if new sub-name (`my-sub`) present : if it's not present then broker will create a new cursor with sub-name (`my-sub`)  by copying from provided legacy sub-name (`my-sub0`)  and delete legacy cursor (`my-sub-0`) \r\n\r\n3. New CPP client will pass correct sub-name. But now, broker will find out if this topic is a partitioned-topic ? If it is then is there any old-invalid-cursor present? If yes, then copy from old-invalid to new cursor and delete old-invalid cursor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/336598524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/336599085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/828#issuecomment-336599085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/828","id":336599085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjU5OTA4NQ==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-14T01:10:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-14T01:10:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I haven't looked #385 entirely but with #822 I think both load-manager can split-bundle and unload without any issue.

So, if Broker-2 still doesn't know about split  (because it might not receive watch) then broker-2 redirects topic request to broker-1\r\n3. Broker-1 knows correct bundle for the lookup topic (either `b2` or `b3`) and redirects the request to appropriate broker.\r\n\r\nSo, all old split-bundles will be disappeared once that broker will restart. We can't remove it from broker immediately because in step-2 if broker-2 may not receive watch and in that case we want broker-2 to redirect request to broker-1 by thinking that old-split-bundle still owned by broker-1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/339443880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/339492445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/858#issuecomment-339492445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/858","id":339492445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTQ5MjQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T22:26:05Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T22:26:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What about restricting which namespaces the proxy can use?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/339492445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/339493884","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/854#issuecomment-339493884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/854","id":339493884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTQ5Mzg4NA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T22:31:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T22:31:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> creating more bundles will increase shutdowntime of broker because broker unloads topic in parallel but unloading bundle happens sequentially.

The goal here is to have the traffic on partitioned topics to be immediately distributed to at least few machines.\r\n\r\nIn any case, for the shutdown time, probably a better option could be to throttle based on number of topics per bundle. \r\n\r\nInstead of shutting down bundles 1 by 1, we could keep shutting down bundles in parallel until a certain threshold of topics is reached. (eg: a semaphore with max 1K topics)\r\n\r\nThat would remove any disadvantage in having more bundles with fewer topics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/339493884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/339500153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/858#issuecomment-339500153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/858","id":339500153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTUwMDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"jai1","id":8659452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8659452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1","html_url":"https://github.com/jai1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T23:01:51Z","updated_at":"2017-10-25T23:01:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are you suggesting to have a list of allowed namespaces (in zk or config file)?\r\n\r\nIn production, roles are closely mapped to a namespace -
