Simply because in complete-topology simulate-wait within a loop.  simulate-wait also has the same timeout code in it but in a loop 10 times, so if you get unlucky and get close to the timeout even once in simulate-wait the outer loop will timeout.

The quality of the Storm code varies. It could stand some improvement. Just like any project that is useful enough to live on, it spans versions of Clojure and its evolution. It also spans the improvement in coding style of its contributors.\n\nI'm with you; I don't want an arbitrary debate. I'd suggest \"defining\" Storm's desired style, roughly, as what 80% of the Clojure community is currently doing. The rest could be left open. Over time, it probably will distill itself with little work on our part.\n\nWhat is the 80% of less-than-controversial advice? I suggest we point people to these useful references (to answer your documentation question):\n- http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Library+Coding+Standards\n- https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide\n\n> Is there an automated tool that you used that can help with this formatting as well?\n\nMany people use Paredit with their editor. If I see a lint tool, I will let you know. I see that https://github.com/jonase/eastwood is one kind of linter; it might be worth a look. I'll keep my eyes open.\n\n@revans2 I'll submit a JIRA ticket. Can you merge quickly?

get.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/45163796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/45164474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/130#issuecomment-45164474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/130","id":45164474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTY0NDc0","user":{"login":"xpe","id":4576329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzYzMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4576329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe","html_url":"https://github.com/xpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-04T23:19:36Z","updated_at":"2014-06-04T23:19:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"See

Network still not efficient enough\n   \n   We can see from the test report, after this fix, the throughput is still bottlenecked by network(CPU: 72%, network: 45%), because there are still margins in the CPU(28%). That’s weird because only 45% of theory network bandwidth is used.\n2.  Uneven machine message receive latency\n   \n   In the experiment, I noticed that there are always some machine whose message receive latency is much higher than the others. For example, tuples generated from machine A, are sent to tasks on machine B, C, D, in one run, tasks on B take more time to receive messages, in another run, D may be the slowest.\n   \n   My guess is that some machine has a longer netty receiver queue than the other machines, and the queue length on all machines becomes stable but not equal after some time(new input = new output) . The latency is different because queue length is different. Changing max.spout.pending won’t improve this, because it only control overall message sent from A, it doesn’t treat B, C, D differently.\n3. better max.spout.pending?\n   I observed, after we tune max.spout.pending to a big enough value, increasing max.spout.pending will only add to latency but not throughput. When spout.pending doubles, the latency doubles.\n   \n   Can we do flow control adaptively so that we stops when there is no further benefit to continue increasing max.spout.pending?\n4.  Potential deadlock when all intermediate buffer is full\n   \n   Consider two worker, task1(workerA) deliver message to task3(workerB), task3 deliver to task2(workerA). There is a loop! It is possible that all worker sender/receiver buffer will be full and block. \n   \n   ![vvvv](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2595532/3188775/ba645bdc-ecbd-11e3-959b-dfb8208d4d1b.png)\n   \n   The current work-around in storm is tricky, it use a unbounded receiver buffer(LinkedBlockingQueue) for each worker to break the loop. But this is not good, because the receiver buffer can potentially be very long, and latency be very high.\n5.  Is it necessary for each task to have a dedicated send queue thread?\n   Currently, each task has a dedicated send queue thread to push data to worker transfer queue. During the profiling, the task send queue thread is usually at wait state. Maybe it is a good idea to use a shared thread pool replace dedicated thread?\n6.  Acker workload very high.\n   In the test, I spotted that the acker task is very busy. As each message size is small(100 byte), there are hugh amout of tuples need to be acked. \n   \n   Can this acker cost be reduced? \n   \n   For example, we can group the tuple at spout to time slice, and each time slice will share a same root tuple Id. For example, the time slice can be 100ms, and there are 10, 000 message in this slice, all share same root id, before sending to acker task, we can first XOR all acker message of same root Id locally on each worker.

That’s weird because only 45% of theory network bandwidth is used.</p>\n\n<p>    2.\tUneven machine message receive latency</p>\n\n<p>      In the experiment, I noticed that there are always some machine whose message receive latency is much higher than the others. For example, tuples generated from machine A, are sent to tasks on machine B, C, D, in one run, tasks on B take more time to receive messages, in another run, D may be the slowest.</p>\n\n<p>      My guess is that some machine has a longer netty receiver queue than the other machines, and the queue length on all machines becomes stable but not equal after some time(new input = new output) . The latency is different because queue length is different. Changing max.spout.pending won’t improve this, because it only control overall message sent from A, it doesn’t treat B, C, D differently.</p>\n\n<p>    3. better max.spout.pending?<br/>\n    I observed, after we tune max.spout.pending to a big enough value, increasing max.spout.pending will only add to latency but not throughput. When spout.pending doubles, the latency doubles.</p>\n\n<p>      Can we do flow control adaptively so that we stops when there is no further benefit to continue increasing max.spout.pending?</p>\n\n<p>    4.\tPotential deadlock when all intermediate buffer is full</p>\n\n<p>      Consider two worker, task1(workerA) deliver message to task3(workerB), task3 deliver to task2(workerA). There is a loop! It is possible that all worker sender/receiver buffer will be full and block. </p>\n\n<p>      !<span class=\"error\">&#91;vvvv&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2595532/3188775/ba645bdc-ecbd-11e3-959b-dfb8208d4d1b.png\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2595532/3188775/ba645bdc-ecbd-11e3-959b-dfb8208d4d1b.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>      The current work-around in storm is tricky, it use a unbounded receiver buffer(LinkedBlockingQueue) for each worker to break the loop. But this is not good, because the receiver buffer can potentially be very long, and latency be very high.</p>\n\n<p>    5.\tIs it necessary for each task to have a dedicated send queue thread?<br/>\n      Currently, each task has a dedicated send queue thread to push data to worker transfer queue. During the profiling, the task send queue thread is usually at wait state. Maybe it is a good idea to use a shared thread pool replace dedicated thread?</p>\n\n<p>    6.\tAcker workload very high.<br/>\n      In the test, I spotted that the acker task is very busy. As each message size is small(100 byte), there are hugh amout of tuples need to be acked. </p>\n\n<p>      Can this acker cost be reduced? </p>\n\n<p>      For example, we can group the tuple at spout to time slice, and each time slice will share a same root tuple Id. For example, the time slice can be 100ms, and there are 10, 000 message in this slice, all share same root id, before sending to acker task, we can first XOR all acker message of same root Id locally on each worker. In that case, we may can reduce the acking network and task cost. The drawback is that when a message is lost, we need to reply all message in this slice.</p>\n\n<p>    7.\tWorker receive thread blocked by task receiver queue</p>\n\n<p>      In worker receiver thread, it will try to publish the messages to the receive queue of each task sequentially in a blocking way.

If the network is OK, then it will pend on the server side, if the network is overwhelmed, then the message will be pending at the netty client side. </p>\n\n<p>    An example is that the spout crazyly generate really big message, but the bandwidth is not enough, it will lead to OOM on the spout worker JVM, and nothing can stop that.</p>\n\n<p>    Bobby's comment mentioned a similar

You don't want acker for its performance penalty, that is no error control. But you do need flow control.</p>\n\n<p>    But the fact is that current storm flow control method \"max.spout.pending\" depends on error control channel \"acker\", that is the dilemma.
