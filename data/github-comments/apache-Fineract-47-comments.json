I won't notify you again about this release, but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1079907976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1079908095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2192#issuecomment-1079908095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2192","id":1079908095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85AXhb_","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-27T11:14:09Z","updated_at":"2022-03-27T11:14:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can't use yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1079908095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1079908353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2192#issuecomment-1079908353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2192","id":1079908353,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85AXhgB","user":{"login":"forking-renovate[bot]","id":34481203,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzQ0ODEyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/7402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/forking-renovate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/forking-renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-27T11:15:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-27T11:15:54Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Renovate Ignore Notification\n\nAs this PR has been closed unmerged, Renovate will ignore this upgrade and you will not receive PRs for *any* future 2.x releases.

The migration is going to run successfully for sure since you're inserting some SQL strings into the report table. But when you try to execute the SQL statements you inserted into the report table - i.e. querying a report, it's going to fail.\r\nFor example the backtick (\\`) is a specific character only used for MySQL to escape literals. That's going to fail with PostgreSQL. You can look at the existing migrations in `0001_initial_data.xml`.
