If that work makes it in then great and if not no worries. We can even save publishing a gremlint artifact to npm for another version. That's no rush in my mind.

I'm sorry to ask you to move it again, but it really should exist at `docs/gremlint` and then we will modify our standard site publish scripts (separate from this PR) to run the `npm run build` and push the static site up to `https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlint`\r\n\r\ni'm really sorry i misunderstood. i should have looked at it more closely earlier. if you do that final change, i would say you should feel free to merge this PR to `master`: VOTE +1  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/811824705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/811901375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1400#issuecomment-811901375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1400","id":811901375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMTkwMTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"OyvindSabo","id":25663729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjYzNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25663729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo","html_url":"https://github.com/OyvindSabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OyvindSabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-01T13:17:39Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T13:17:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No worries:) I moved the folder now and also studied the TinkerPop site generating scripts a bit closer, so now I have a better understanding of how the current website stuff works.

The reason the gremlint page can't be viewed if you open it as a file locally is that the built site consists of an HTML document which imports JavaScript files (as opposed to having it all inlined in the html document). When opened as a file locally those imports are considered to be cross-origin requests by the browser and blocked. It works if you serve the `index.html` file from a web server, since then all the files will be served from the same origin.\r\n\r\nIf you have npm > 5.2.0 you can test the gremlint page by running `npx serve target/site/home/gremlint`, and the home page, for instance by running `npx serve target/site/home`.\r\n\r\nThe error in the published page on https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlint/ seems to be different, though. After looking at it for a while I noticed that the static assets are imported from `https://tinkerpop.apache.org/static/` instead of `https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlint/static/`, where they are actually located.

I renamed almost everything and which helped me to realized that i could kill some code which ended up getting rid of some \"tasks\" and \"executors\" and simplified some things. Basic structure now is that the `UnifiedHandler` (still not sure i want to go with the functional naming you suggested) creates a `SessionTask` which is submitted to a `Session` to be executed. The `Session` consumes a thread from the `gremlinPool` to do its work and is either a `SingleTaskSession` (meaning it executes the `SessionTask` that called for its creation and then completes) or is a `MultiTaskSession` (meaning it executes the initial `SessionTask` that called for its creation and then holds the thread awaiting more `SessionTask` instances to be submitted to it).\r\n3. Lots more javadoc that i hope is more clear and a lot more inline comments.\r\n\r\nWell, done with this for the weekend unless i'm struck by some fresh bit of thinking. I kinda like where it is. I think you're initial review helped refine things.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/817045551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/819001271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1415#issuecomment-819001271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1415","id":819001271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTAwMTI3MQ==","user":{"login":"lyndonbauto","id":58273576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58273576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto","html_url":"https://github.com/lyndonbauto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyndonbauto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T19:36:08Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T19:36:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing

than Tornado's. I tried setting it up and all the tests failed whenever I used it so I don't think it is compatible with the current Gremlin server. I looked at aiogremlin's driver and found they didn't have it setup there either so I thought it might just not work for this use case unfortunately.

So, this probably needs to target `master` to be released as part of 3.6.0.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we want to align the settings across drivers, then I wonder whether the Java default values are really better than the .NET or Python defaults. Ideally, we would perform some benchmarks for different scenarios and with all three drivers to find some meaningful numbers and also to verify that the same values perform similarly for the different drivers.

Could you please make sure PRs have the JIRA number in the title and the link in the description (the former allows for some integration to happen and the latter is just convenient)?\r\n2. You could have just added the section \"Upgrading for Users\" and a sub-heading for your change. The \"Upgrading for Users\" is there now after a merge I just did.\r\n3. ultimately, please squash your commits for this PR\r\n\r\nThe only other administrative point relates to where this PR should land. I had thought that it `3.5-dev` was fine but I don't think I counted on the connection pool defaults shifting in the fashion @FlorianHockmann presented. \r\n\r\n> then I wonder whether the Java default values are really better than the .NET or Python defaults\r\n\r\nI think this was why I didn't expect a major breaking change @FlorianHockmann and that we could explain away default adjustments in the upgrade documentation. I was thinking mostly of  `maxContentLength` getting bigger in Java (only someone relying on a smaller number, which is unlikely, would encounter a problem) and timeouts growing a bit longer. You're right that Java may not have been the ideal model. \r\n\r\n@krlawrence do you have recommendations for a `maxContentLength` default? or any other defaults for that matter?\r\n\r\nFor now, let's see how the changes would actually affect folks before we decide if the change will be too radical for 3.5.x.\r\n\r\n@simonz-bq - this issue was as much about identifying the configuration commonalities and gaps as it was about changing the defaults themselves, so I think all of this feedback is expected. From the PR, it seems that the only items in common are:\r\n\r\n* connection pools\r\n* max content length\r\n\r\nis that really all there is (i'd have guessed there were various timeouts in common in some way)? and does javascript not include any commonality at all? Note that settings may not be named in the same way or may be taking defaults from the underlying websocket library being used. Moreover, if you're only looking at the \"Configuration\" sections of the various language variants in the Reference Documentation, this may be incomplete. Perhaps another part of this effort should be to examine/update the documentation for completeness.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/916819246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/917306703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1472#issuecomment-917306703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1472","id":917306703,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc42rP1P","user":{"login":"simonz-bq","id":42222408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjIyNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42222408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq","html_url":"https://github.com/simonz-bq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-11T00:47:41Z","updated_at":"2021-09-11T00:47:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I updated the PR with the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Use maxSimultaneousUsagePerConnection as the equivalent for the MaxInProcessPerConnection in .NET\r\n- Added JIRA number in title\r\n- Added description in upgrading for users section\r\n- Squashed the commits (I'm used to just doing this when merging in the PR)\r\n\r\nI think this is a reasonable state for the PR to be in until more discussion is done.\r\n\r\n@spmallette The timeouts matched when there was an equivalent option.
