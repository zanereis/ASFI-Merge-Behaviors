There are test cases where replace table is failing when a concurrent operation adds a snapshot. The problem is that the replace table produces a snapshot with the next sequence number after the metadata it was based on, but the concurrent commit also uses the same sequence number. Then the commit fails with this error message:\r\n\r\n> Cannot add snapshot with sequence number 2 older than last sequence number 2\r\n\r\nThat's a little inaccurate because it is not strictly older, but the point is that the table's current sequence number is 2 and the new sequence number is not newer (greater than 2).\r\n\r\nI looked into whether we can fix this by sending a `CommitFailedException` back to the client because it was out of sync with the current table metadata, but a replace table transaction doesn't currently recommit operations. For a normal transaction, a retry results in each operation getting re-applied (recommitted) on top of the last operation to rebuild metadata. That's unnecessary for replace transactions because any data is completely independent of prior versions. All that needs to happen is that the new snapshot is added and made the current snapshot.\r\n\r\nGiven that the replace transaction won't rebuild metadata to rewrite the sequence number, retry isn't helpful. We could update retry to rewrite metadata, but that isn't really necessary because the new snapshot is independent. A simpler fix that appears to fix the tests is to update the check in `TableMetadata.Builder` to allow sequence number reuse if the added snapshot's parent is null (as in the case of a replace table operation). That's safe because there are no existing files.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java b/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java\r\nindex be510dea20..82953c8385 100644\r\n--- a/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java\r\n+++ b/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java\r\n@@ -1141,7 +1141,7 @@ public class TableMetadata implements Serializable {\r\n           snapshot.snapshotId());\r\n \r\n       ValidationException.check(\r\n-          formatVersion == 1 || snapshot.sequenceNumber() > lastSequenceNumber,\r\n+          formatVersion == 1 || snapshot.sequenceNumber() > lastSequenceNumber || snapshot.parentId() == null,\r\n           \"Cannot add snapshot with sequence number %s older than last sequence number %s\",\r\n           snapshot.sequenceNumber(),\r\n           lastSequenceNumber);\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1703950561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1703950932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8390#issuecomment-1703950932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8390","id":1703950932,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lkDpU","user":{"login":"bryanck","id":5475421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5475421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck","html_url":"https://github.com/bryanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bryanck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-02T22:03:59Z","updated_at":"2023-09-03T01:27:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, ultimately the other catalogs allow the operation simply because they base the sequence number comparison on the older base snapshot, but they do in fact add the snapshot of the same sequence number.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1703950932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1703951309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8390#issuecomment-1703951309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8390","id":1703951309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lkDvN","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-02T22:07:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-02T22:07:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Bryan, sorry to tag you and then post a fix.

The implementation added to `BaseMetastoreCatalog` here seems strange to me because it has so many implementations that throw `UnsupportedOperationException`. I don't think that adding `ViewCatalog` to that base class is a good idea because it implements so little of the interface -- I'd rather use a util class of helpers or some alternative.\r\n\r\nThat PR is one idea. I don't think I like it either, but it at least demonstrates one way to accomplish the same goal. It also shows to how fix tests without needing `CatalogWithViews`.\r\n\r\nI think that the problem this was trying to solve is to provide a base implementation to catalogs already inheriting from `BaseMetastoreCatalog`. In that case, I think the cleanest solution is to add a subclass of `BaseMetastoreCatalog` that adds the shared view methods. That can be an abstract class that can leave out all of the unsupported methods. Then to use the new base class, you'd just switch from `extends BaseMetastoreCatalog` to `extends BaseMetastoreViewCatalog`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1705735777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1705746596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8173#issuecomment-1705746596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8173","id":1705746596,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lq6Ck","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-04T22:44:21Z","updated_at":"2023-09-04T22:44:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm

If I understand right, we still would want to preserve this cleanup regardless of commit outcome or strict cleanup because that set of files would be files from previous commit attempts which we can safely cleanup.\r\n\r\n\r\n> @amogh-jahagirdar, in addition to fixing this, I think we also need to look into file cleanup for transactions. I was reviewing the current handling and I noticed that the deletedFiles set is never cleared between retries for a SIMPLE transaction. As a result, there is a chance that a file that was deleted by one operation's commit but reused when that operation is recommitted will remain in the delete set and be removed.\r\n\r\n> I think all we need to do is to clear the delete file set before each commit attempt.

I would like your opinion on the following:\r\n* From my point of view we need to support some spatial metadata - especially CRS  ). I propose to reuse the same as in the geoparquet definition: https://geoparquet.org/releases/v1.0.0-rc.1/\r\n* What do you propose as an underlying storage format? You mention three: geoparquet, spatialparquet and Geolake parquet and you implemented geoparquet, geoparquet (bbox), Geolake parquet. I propose to reduce this to one. At the moment it looks to me geoparquet has the largest community and support also in other systems (e.g. geopandas), which may make it easier to use in the Iceberg ecosystem (e.g. https://py.iceberg.apache.org/)\r\n\r\nGenerally, I propose to go with a  roadmap with a simple release first first to make it also easier for people from the Iceberg project to review and get initial feedback from the Iceberg community, e.g.:\r\nFirst release: Storage backend geoparquet (and also include geoparquet metadata). Supported Ecosystem: Apache Sedona - Spark\r\nSecond release: Add XZ partitioning. Supported Ecosystem: Apache Sedona Spark and Flink and PyIceberg.\r\nThird release: Include raster data (here the challenge is to split a big raster into multiple tiles that are transparently read as one, cf. https://sedona.apache.org/1.4.1/tutorial/storing-blobs-in-parquet/)...?\r\n\r\nThis is just an example, it can be changed in the detail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1707233081/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1707277313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7412#issuecomment-1707277313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7412","id":1707277313,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85lwvwB","user":{"login":"Prometheus1400","id":65053946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDUzOTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65053946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400","html_url":"https://github.com/Prometheus1400","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prometheus1400/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-05T20:37:30Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T20:37:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Great work, this feature is exactly what my team needs.
