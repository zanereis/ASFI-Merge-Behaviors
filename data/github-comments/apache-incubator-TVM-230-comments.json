However, AFAIK, most if not all of the commonly used random ops simply require random bits as inputs (i.e. don't care about how those bits were generated). I propose the following approach to handling different kernels (thanks to @jroesch for helpful discussion):\r\n\r\n- For each kernel `K` (e.g. `K = threefry`, `K = philox`, etc.), define `relay.random.K_key`, `relay.random.K_split` , and `relay.random.K_generate`.\r\n- In Python (and any other host language where we plan on writing Relay code directly), define `relay.random.key(seed: int, K: RandomAlg)` (where `RandomAlg` is some kind of enum with members `RandomAlg.THREEFRY` etc.) and `relay.random.split(key, K: RandomAlg)`. We can set a default K (for now obviously Threefry) to make it easier to use.\r\n- Now, for each random op `rop` that we care about, define `relay.random.rop_from_bits`, and in Python define `relay.random.rop(key, K)` which internally calls `relay.random.rop_from_bits(relay.random.K_generate(key))`. This should suffice to hide the algorithm from the user-facing API.\r\n\r\n**Problems.**\r\n\r\n- This might fail silently if the user inconsistently uses a key for kernel K with an op that uses kernel L ≠ K, if the keys are the same shape. This seems quite bad. Ideally, the keys will somehow be typed (perhaps we can use a Relay ADT?) but not sure how well supported this kind of use case is currently.\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n- I will open a follow-up PR that adds some initial operators (currently I have a uniform random op), along with support for non-multiple of 4 sizes.\r\n- We should think about how to generalize over dtypes - currently, only `uint64` is supported for random bit generation in Threefry. Do we want to support more in the bit generation (is it possible?), or should we delegate this responsibility to auxiliary ops that split/join the `uint64`s as needed (e.g. converting 5 `uint64` to 10 `uint32`)? I think we need to come up with some kind of standardized approach for all the future random ops.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/745532366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/745537619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7115#issuecomment-745537619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7115","id":745537619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTUzNzYxOQ==","user":{"login":"hogepodge","id":367747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge","html_url":"https://github.com/hogepodge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hogepodge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T20:09:10Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T20:09:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/745537619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/745544492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6959#issuecomment-745544492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6959","id":745544492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTU0NDQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T20:21:51Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T20:21:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just tested with Jupyter notebook -

While I in general agree that for cases that are user facing, having clear error message would be helpful.\r\n\r\nI would be hesitant to enforce error message for every internal invariance check. This decision is more of an engineering tradeoff. For example are many ways to improve code robustness and readability, code comment is one of them.  However, it does not necessarily mean we need to comment every line of code, even though it is possible to do so and doing so might improve readability slightly. \r\n\r\nDevelopers may want to spend their attentions in other matters and we also need to balance these concerns, so as long as the code structure is clear, we could focus the code review on more important things -- e.g. documenting the interface clearly, making sure the overall logics are correct.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, while it is always possible to add error message to every internal invariance checks, I don't think we are required to do so for every care. We can find many similar examples(like the ones below) in other large code base like TensorFlow and PyTorch, doing so doesn't make pytorch or tensorflow not product ready.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/utils/throughput_benchmark.cpp#L25\r\n- https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/replicate_per_replica_nodes_test.cc#L54\r\n\r\nOf course this does not mean that we should not add error messages to the checks that could cause user facing errors. We should actually shift our attention to address these checks quickly, while giving flexibility to the developers in other cases that have minimum gain.\r\n\r\nIn summary, **context of the code** matters, and I believe code review should focus on understanding the overall logics, trying to think about readability in a broader context(other than error message itself), while encouraging things to move on smoothly once things met a good quality. \r\n\r\nIn this case we have discussed and I believe the ICHECK on pointer null invariant checking is not necessary. While it is indeed helpful to have better error message in other two cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n

I understand that there could be inconvenience here, but the benefits offered by standardization outweights the slight additional eng cost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/747572747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/747598083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7084#issuecomment-747598083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7084","id":747598083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzU5ODA4Mw==","user":{"login":"tkonolige","id":1501680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1501680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige","html_url":"https://github.com/tkonolige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T17:52:53Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T17:52:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm a little confused on how we use return in tir?

I do agree that is an approach, but it just solves the one case rather than this issue more generally.\r\n\r\n@rkimball is right in saying that Python handles retrying internally--here is how it does it: when you call e.g. `os.read`, an internal CPython function (written in C) enters a loop. Each time, it calls read, and if it gets back `EINTR`, it calls `PyErr_CheckSignals` in a normal (I.e. not signal handler) context. It may get `EINTR` for many reasons, but one could be that a signal handler was invoked. When this happens and CPython is listening for said signal handler, it will have registered a C signal handler by calling `signal`. The OS now aborts `read` and calls this C signal handler. Notably, inside the C signal handler, the Python interpreter can't be resumed to handle the signal in Python, because the signal handler could be invoked at any time and that would be a multithreading catastrophe. So instead CPython sets an internal \"signal handler pending\" flag.\r\n\r\nNow two things could happen depending on the value of `siginterrupt`. If `siginterrupt` is set, then the syscall will return `EINTR`. If not, the OS will resume the syscall internally as if nothing happened. In the `EINTR` case, C functions called from Python should call `PyErr_CheckSignals`. Though it is called from a \"c function call instruction,\" `PyErr_CheckSignals` checks if there are any pending Python-side signal handlers and jumps the Python interpreter to those Python-side signal handlers. If one of those raises an exception, the signal handler terminates and `PyErr_CheckSignals` returns 1. It is a bit of a hack to call this function from cython/ctypes, but it worked in my prototype.\r\n\r\nNote that in the case that `siginterrupt` is 0, a C extension probably should call `PyErr_CheckSignals` if it is not merely wrapping an OS syscall, because if `SIGINT` happened and was swallowed by `siginterrupt`, the C extension does need to handle the side effect of the syscall (i.e. the data returned from os.read should go somewhere), but it should not issue *another* syscall which may block and make Ctrl+C appear to do nothing. I believe this is why `siginterrupt` is automatically set when you set a custom Python signal handler.\r\n\r\nfrom Python's perspective, calling TVM's C functions through cython or ctypes is *the same* as calling one of its internal syscall wrapper functions. Python is expecting us to also handle `EINTR` ourselves. so if we add this hook, we are holding up our end of the contract, and solving this not just for socket ops, but providing an easy way to handle this for e.g. GPU syscalls. Finally, new language frontends need only implement this hook, rather than solve this in each separate e.g. socket, GPU, etc case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/747679635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/747688337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7122#issuecomment-747688337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7122","id":747688337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzY4ODMzNw==","user":{"login":"u99127","id":19559067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU5MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19559067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127","html_url":"https://github.com/u99127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/u99127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T20:38:31Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T20:44:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> LGTM to the dockerfile and build config.
