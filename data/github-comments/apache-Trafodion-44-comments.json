It makes WITH entirely a syntactic sugar in Trafodion.\n\nIn the future, we'll want to reconsider this. WITH (without RECURSIVE) is a form of manual common sub-expression elimination. Some merchant database engines have multiple possible plans for these queries: The subquery could be evaluated once and materialized, then that result is plugged into the query tree wherever needed. Or the subquery can be \"inlined\", meaning that it will be re-evaluated each time it is encountered. A syntax-only approach doesn't allow us to do this. Though I could imagine that if we put relational common-subexpression logic into our normalizer, we could then consider it.\n\nA minor issue with the syntax-only approach is that if a subquery in the WITH clause is not referenced, we don't do any error checking on it. So, I could say, WITH T1 AS (SELECT \\* FROM NON_EXISTENT_TABLE) SELECT \\* FROM EXISTING_TABLE and not get an error. I don't know what the standard says about this or what other products do. It is good enough for now.

the yacc file to remove the reduce/reduce conflict. The reduce/reduce seems to be related between no_rollback and query_expression, but very hard to make it correct.\n\nANSI defined 'with clause' is as Hans pointed out, in Trafodion yacc:\n\n```\n       query_expression : non_join_query_expression\n            |   with_clause non_join_query_expression\n```\n\nWhat I proposed to define is:\n\n```\n         dml_statement : dml_query { $$ = $1; }\n\n           | with_clause dml_query\n             {\n               $$ = $2;\n             }\n\n      dml_query : query_expression order_by_clause access_type\n        optional_lock_mode for_update_spec optional_limit_spec\n\n      | query_expression order_by_clause_non_empty\n        group_by_clause_non_empty access_type optional_lock_mode\n        for_update_spec optional_limit_spec\n```\n\nFrom syntax point of view, these two definitions are same, and ANSI has no dml_query definition, so we cannot 100% aligned with ANSI grammar IMHO.\n\nThe second definition will not introduce new reduce/reduce or shift/reduce conflict.

I think the ANSI standard allows those.

But I assume there must be some reason Trafodion set four ulimit, if 'ulimit -u' is not required, we should also remove it from trafodion_install, and remove it from here.\n\nHowever, this checking will not block the sqstart, just print some warning, in case the user do meet problems.\n\nI am fine to remove the checking of 'ulimit -u'.
