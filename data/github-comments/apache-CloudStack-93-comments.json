is better now.\nI only have to point two things out.\n1 – About the class “com.cloud.storage.ImageStoreDetailsUtil” that you created. You are using static methods, and those static methods are using “variables” that you want to set using the spring suite. The way you did will not work; to my knowledge, those attributes will not be set by spring. If you want to set them with spring you should annotate the class with “@component”, then the object will be in the spring life cycle, and those attributes will be set properly. Of course, if you do that, remove the static from those methods (getNfsVersionByUuid, getNfsVersion) and then you would have to inject the \"ImageStoreDetailsUtil\" object into those classes that want to use the “getNfsVersion” methods.\n\n2 – The java doc you created for “com.cloud.storage.ImageStoreDetailsUtil.getNfsVersion(long)” is pretty nice. I would like to see the same in “com.cloud.storage.ImageStoreDetailsUtil.getNfsVersionByUuid(String)”.

@nvazquez, \nI see that you have created a spring bean as I said. However, I noticed some things that may not be needed or that seemed out of place to me. Before I start pointing them out, do you know how spring works? It is not a problem not to know in depth this kind of framework, but if you do not I could prepare some explanation in detail, so it facilitates in the future for you.\n\nAt the “spring-engine-storage-image-core-context.xml” line 31, I noticed that you added the bean “imageStoreDetailsUtilImpl” as a dependency of the “templateServiceImpl” bean; that is not necessary, if the bean “templateServiceImpl” has a property of type “imageStoreDetailsUtilImpl” annotated with \"@Inject/@Autowired\", Spring will automatically sort and create the hierarchy of beans dependencies to instantiate and inject. That “depends-on” configuration can be used for some things that are slightly different; if you are curious about that we can chat in off, just call me on slack or shoot me an email.\n\nStill on “spring-engine-storage-image-core-context.xml” at line 40, you declared the bean “imageStoreDetailsUtilImpl”, that is only necessary if you were not using the “@Component” annotation (there are others that you could use too, such as @Service, @Bean and others, each one to mark a different use type of bean); having said that, there is no need to declare the bean in the XML.\n\n If you tried to build and run the ACS with your changes, but ended up with the application not going up because some problem with Spring dependency resolution; that might have happened because of ACS application contexts hierarchy, If that happened I can help you find the best place to declare the bean; otherwise, you can just use the annotation that is fine, no need to re-declare the bean in an XML file. I do not think that problem will happen because the bean will be created at one of the top-level application contexts of ACS.\n\nNow about the bean itself; I noticed that you created an interface to declare the bean's methods. Normally, when we are creating DAO or service classes that is the right way to do things, create an interface and then the implementation, allowing to use object orientation (O.O.) to change the implementation in the future with configurations in an XML file; (an opinion) this is not the same as creating code for the future, but it is preparing the architecture of a system for the future, I dislike the first one and like the second one. However, with the use of annotations, it is not that easy to change implementation as it is when using XML spring beans declaration; it is not possible to inject a different object that implemented the same interface, since annotations make everything pretty straightforward, so I think it is better to lose the interface and work just with a single class that is the component itself.\n\nAdditionally, I noticed that in your interface (that I suggest you not to use in this specific case) you extended the interface “Manager” that brings a lot of things that you do not use, I am guessing you did that because you have seen some other classes, and they all do that. Well, guess what, in your case that is not needed. Actually, in most cases that the \"Manager\" interface is being used that interface is not needed; I find the “Manager” interface hierarchy a real nightmare, but that is a topic for another chat. \n\nIn all of the places you injected the” imageStoreDetailsUtil” object, I suggest you removing the “_” from the attribute name and making them private.\n\nNow the problem with poor application architecture planning appears (it is not your fault, you are actually doing a great job). In some “service/manager/others” that should work as singletons, but are not, your “@Inject” will not work.\nThese classes “VmwareStorageManagerImpl”, “VmwareStorageProcessor”, “VmwareStorageSubsystemCommandHandler” and “DownloadManagerImpl” are manually instantiated (I might have missed some other), which means that they do not pass through the Spring framework lifecycle, which means that @Inject on them will not work. To transform them into Spring managed objects, it would require much more effort than you should be doing (you are already doing applying a great effort on this). What you can do is to get that bean during the object initialization at their constructor; you can use the “com.cloud.utils.component.ComponentContext.getApplicationContext()” to retrieve the Spring application context, and then the getBean method, to retrieve the desired bean; then you are good to set that bean in an attribute of the object and use it as you are now. Just do not forget to remove the @Inject from the aforementioned classes.\n\nI recommend you after applying those changes, you should try to build and start up the application (ACS with your PR) to check if everything is getting injected and is working as expected. If you run into any problems, just call me.\n\n@nvazquez, that is the way to do it, unit tests using mock DAOs, you are on the right track ;)\n\nBTW: I liked very much your code, small methods, with test cases (still to come) and java doc\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/178267025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/178346694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1361#issuecomment-178346694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1361","id":178346694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODM0NjY5NA==","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-02T03:32:11Z","updated_at":"2016-02-02T03:32:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner thanks for your reply!\n\nI'm familiar to Spring, I've worked with it, I know how it works but I wouldn't say I know it in depth.

if you have any doubt in some of the spring modules, just shoot me an email (If I have the knowledge I will not hesitate to help you).\nNow I see why you declared the bean in the XML file. If that was the case, then we can try to find a better place for it. If we are going to declare the bean in an XML file, you can also remove the @Component annotation from it.\n\nLooking at the ACS structure, I believe that one of the best places to put this bean would be the “spring-engine-storage-core-context”, instead of “spring-engine-storage-image-core-context”. I find it better to make the bean you created available to every project/plugin-in that works with storage.\n\nI will be waiting to see the result from your test with a VMware
