I'm not sure if there's an easy way to find/replace these with getters/setters, and a lot of it requires manual intervention anyway (use of getListSize() instead of getList().size() or using the variable type as boolean to use \"is\" instead of \"get\", and primitive setters can't use increment, and verifying that null values is the same as \"is not set\" instead of \"is set to null\"). It's probably safer to review each compilation failure on a case-by-case basis and fix each one manually, than to try an automated procedure that's going to miss things. As the reviewer, it's probably the same outcome (because you don't know what the implementer considered or overlooked), but for the person implementing it, I think they'll likely catch more things the automation would have missed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1572962874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1573682533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3418#issuecomment-1573682533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3418","id":1573682533,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5dzH1l","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-02T12:48:07Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T12:48:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This looks good.

So we could in theory start merging in these no-chop merge changes like this into main as they are finished/ready as long as it wouldn't break existing behavior (and this PR doesn't as the fencing won't be used yet).

Here are my reasons:\r\n\r\nThe re-logging that 1.x did was because we were tightly coupled to the log4j implementation and had no way to easily disambiguate between logs produced by the monitor and logs received by the monitor, using that old implementation. In the new implementation, these aren't even log4j objects anymore, but a serialized JSON message that is expected at the REST endpoint. Changing that implementation was necessary because of the numerous vulnerabilities the socket appender and log object serialization code that log4j previously provided in order to support serializing and sending log objects. If we were to try to convert these JSON messages back into log messages, we would either have to pretend to be the original logger in order to get them to print correctly, or we'd have to just relog them as a new logger, with a very messy message without the ability to nicely print the stack traces, or we would have to tightly couple ourselves to log4j again to use their serialization, which I'm not even sure is supported anymore, because of the aforementioned vulnerabilities. And, I'm not sure I'd want to couple ourselves to log4j code like that anyway, because of the work we've done to make the logging more extensible through slf4j.\r\n\r\nEven if we were to go back and try to reproduce this behavior, it is not a great way to do log aggregation. In principle, the view on the monitor is for convenience. It is not a good substitute for proper log aggregation. It's not efficient, and I don't even think I'd recommend having it configured at all (for security reasons... because we are sending potentially sensitive internal logs to a web service that has no authentication), if it weren't for the fact that existing users expect it (and accept or mitigate the risks for doing so).\r\n\r\nDoing this would result in worse results than using an appender that is actually designed to do log aggregation, like one that sends to an rsyslog service or similar. A quick Google search resulted in several tutorials on how to use log4j2 with rsyslog, or centralized log4j2 aggregation in general. Since there are already solutions available to users, which are better in many ways than what we would do, I think it's better that we defer to users to customize their logging, and we merely provide the current basic implementation, and support users through the use of customizable logging libraries (like continuing to use slf4j).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1579485702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1579804892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3436#issuecomment-1579804892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3436","id":1579804892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5eKejc","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T03:10:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T06:08:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> An argument to test the hadoop functionality - at least to some extent is to validate the the function continues to work as expected in future releases - if the \"hadoop\" functionality changed (or broke) we may catch that in out automated test runs and then we would be in a position to take some action - maybe we need to do something different? Submit a patch to hadoop? Or at a minimum, warn users that the function may not work as expected after x.y.z.\r\n> \r\n> I'm not sure how extensively we are checking the behavior here, but some validation might be valuable.\r\n\r\nMy argument against, as a general rule, is that regression testing for Hadoop features should be contributed to Hadoop. We cannot be the landing zone for testing all the Hadoop features we think Hadoop is not testing adequately. I suggest contributing those tests to Hadoop to make Hadoop better, and watching its build statuses/change history for the features we care about, and try to focus our tests on testing our code.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely not arguing against testing... just advocating for contributing them to the proper venue. We shouldn't treat Accumulo as a personal playground for testing other libraries we care about. We should play more nicely with those other open source projects, and contribute tests to them, if we think they need that testing.\r\n\r\nThat said, everything is on a case-by-case basis, and I'm not sure exactly what, if anything, should change here once the property is dropped, with respect to this testing, until I look at it, which I will do shortly. But I think it's important to stake out a general principle, so we don't suffer from scope creep.\r\n\r\nEDIT: after looking at this specific case, I kept all the tests (except the one that checked that we bypassed the trash, since we can't bypass the trash after the property is dropped). The reason I kept them in this specific case is that I think they are also integration tests to ensure we're calling moveToTrash in the first place. These ITs could be replaced with a mocked UT, though, just to make sure we're calling fs.moveToTrash, and we can defer to Hadoop to make sure that fs.moveToTrash actually works. I will pass on making these mocked UTs for now, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1579804892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1579812961","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3446#issuecomment-1579812961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3446","id":1579812961,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5eKghh","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T03:22:17Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T03:23:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@keith-ratcliffe wrote:\r\n> **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior (or a link to an example repository that reproduces the problem):\r\n> \r\n> In a 2.1.1-SNAPSHOT with jline 3.22.0, do the following\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>  accumulo shell -u *** -p *** -e 'tables -np' 1>ashell.stdout 2>ashell.stderr\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Observe that the expected output from the tables command goes to ashell.stderr\r\n\r\nI'm going to try to run this and generate my own output, to see the differences in behavior you're talking about, in order to try to track this down.

For this case may not want to flush a tablet that is being actively written to and scanned, but once it has not been written for a while it makes sense to flush it.\r\n\r\nMaybe the new timeout makes sense for the new eventual scan use case and the idle timeout still makes sense for the existing immediate scan use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1580990595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1581190230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3368#issuecomment-1581190230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3368","id":1581190230,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5ePwxW","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T16:48:57Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T16:48:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> EDIT: The nodes are using a short-hostname.

But, outside that method, there was a `currentTServers` in the `run` method. It looks like the parameter name for `flushChanges` got misunderstood to be the same as the `currentTServers` variable, when it never actually was... it was always `destinations` by the wrong name.\r\n\r\nOkay, after reviewing the details, I'm confident this fixes the issue in 2.1.0. However, I'd like to keep the original `destinations` name, rather than rename the variable. It just makes the already complicated code history easier to follow when we're not arbitrarily changing variable names alongside the substantive changes. And, in this case, I don't think adding \"valid\" to the variable name makes it more clear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1585224599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1585226573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3479#issuecomment-1585226573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3479","id":1585226573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5efKNN","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-09T23:06:45Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T23:06:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm fine with that.
