LGTM! \r\n\r\nYes, the `--streaming` flag is considered but if you omit it the Flink runner will choose batch/streaming based on the whether there are any unbounded sources or not. `WindowedWordCountIT` would be executed as batch since there are no unbounded source.\r\n\r\nHowever, even when you execute this job using `--streaming=true` it will still terminate because we only have bounded sources and the Flink streaming runner will terminate once all operators finish.\r\n\r\nI would like to have a proper \"streaming\" test with unbounded sources where we manually cancel the job once the stopping condition is met. (Like the `TestDataflowRunner` does by waiting for the `PAssert` metrics to show that all PAsserts passed.) For this, however, we need metrics support in the Flink Runner and we need to extend the `TestFlinkRunner` in a similar way. By the way, how does the Dataflow runner know when the `WindowedWordCountIT` has finished?\r\n\r\nAlso, the success matcher set in `WindowedWordCountIT` is ignored by the `TestFlinkRunner`.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this still LGTM! Because some coverage is better than none.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/284993815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/285015527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2194#issuecomment-285015527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2194","id":285015527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTAxNTUyNw==","user":{"login":"tibkiss","id":113485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss","html_url":"https://github.com/tibkiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-08T11:19:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T11:19:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:
