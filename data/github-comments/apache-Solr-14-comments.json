If you do this, also users are allowed to create symlinks, otherwise you need admin privileges. On the Jnekins server this is by default the case, this is why it works there.\r\n- When checking out the repository you have to pass command line parameters to \"enable symlinks\". Usual tools like TortoiseGit (I use that), do not do this. This leads to symlinks checked out as plain text files with the target path as file contents. A global config property does not work, as GIT requires the property to be passed always and explicit when checking out (so GUI users like I am are out). Once you have the checkout, it works somehow. But if you have no developer mode or admin access (and klick on the UAC prompt) it breaks again. So this is a pain! Microsoft misdesigned symlinks, because they were afraid of bad things done with them (like you place a symlink there pointing to temp directory with some häckidihickhack malware and nowbody would notice). So without developer mode and some extra settings and also extra command line options (because Git people did not want the git client to be forcefully executed with admin rights, so you need to opt-in) your hopeless.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be to have:\r\n- a simple list of files in the example directories\r\n- possibly a a \"gitignore *.java\" file in each\r\n- a Gradle build step that reads the file and copies the files over to the examples directory. The good thing with that: symlinks get quickly out of sync because nothing checks that they are still valid.

Yes, FilterQuery here is as in `FilterQuery.java`, which is really specific, almost always invoked via `filter([backing_query])`, when you want consult the filterCache for the backing query in a context where it would normally _not_ consult the filterCache. This is particulary useful, e.g., for fine-grained control of how subclauses in queries are cached. That use-case/concept doesn't go away if there's a closer relationship between `fq` and `FilterQuery` ... if anything I could see renaming `FilterQuery` to be more clearly distinct from `fq` (in fact, it's hard to search Jira for issues related to `FilterQuery` because that term is indeed often used informally to refer to `fq`).\r\n\r\nSo, just to clarify, your [comment above](#pullrequestreview-887690496) should no longer be a concern (i.e., `fq={!cache=false}foo:bar` would definitely still work as it currently does)?

\"`fq=filter(foo:bar) OR foo:baz`\" is already supported, and this PR wouldn't change that particular example; and yes this example illustrates one reasonable use of `filter(...)`: to separately consult the filterCache for the \"`foo:bar`\" subclause, in addition to consulting filterCache (in this example) for the overall `fq`.\r\n\r\nSo appropriately, this example would result in two filterCache consultations. This PR addresses the case where `fq` and `filter(...)` are coterminous -- where they represent exactly the same fundamental query, but would currently be cached twice.\r\n\r\nI guess the way I think about it, `filter(...)` gives you arbitrarily granular control over how subclauses get cached. The `fq=filter(...)` example is really straightforward, but is admittedly unlikely to come up in \"real world\" use. The use that initially motivated my interest in this is perhaps informative: the `relatedness` JSON facet function accepts a single query arg to define its \"foreground set\". For obvious reasons, I wanted to define the foreground set to be \"the combination of main query and filters\", but I found that doing so via the FiltersQParser (\"`{!filters param=$q param=$fq}`\") resulted in consulting the filterCache for the top-level combination of q&fq, not finding it (of course), and running all the underlying queries without consulting the cache! Having fixed FiltersQParser to generate FilterQuery instances for its individual subclauses (separate PR forthcoming), I found that each of the subclauses was getting cached twice: once as the clause's underlying query, and once as the clause's FIlterQuery wrapper. That behavior is what this PR fixes, and the behavior that the associated test is designed to evaluate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1045310607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1045375820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/653#issuecomment-1045375820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/653","id":1045375820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM4-TytM","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-18T23:52:45Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T23:52:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I started looking into it but reverted original commit on main.
