They were always the same.  There were various places in the code where the name `guid`, `docID`, or `id` were used that all implicitly meant the Metron GUID.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the Metron-generated guid will never be equal to the Elasticsearch-generated doc ID. You can view and use either the guid or the doc ID in the UI.  Both are available as separate fields in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR has tried to make clear what is a Metron GUID and what is a document ID.  In the Alerts UI you can see and/or use either the GUID or the document ID.  It is up to the user which one they care to see.  Although most users will not care what the document ID is.\r\n\r\nFrom my PR description:\r\n\r\n> This change is backwards compatible. The Alerts UI should continue to work no matter if some of the underlying indices were written with the Metron GUID as the document ID and some are written with the auto-generated document ID.\r\n\r\nThere is no option to continue to use the GUID as the documentID.  I can't think of a use case worthy of the additional effort and testing needed to support that.  To do that, we would need to run all of the integration tests twice, once for each \"mode\".\r\n\r\nIt is backwards compatible in that the Alerts UI will work when searching over both \"legacy\" indices where guid = docID and \"new\" indices where guid != docID.  All places in the code where a docID is needed, that docID is actually first retrieved from Elasticsearch, rather than making an assumption about what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/444535358/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/444689576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1288#issuecomment-444689576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1288","id":444689576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDY4OTU3Ng==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T23:21:49Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T23:21:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It was when I was working on #1289  .

Update README's with some explanation of the multiple UI and REST API communication architecture - e.g. I had expected there was a way to have the REST application and Angular application assets be served up by (or have the REST calls handled through) the same web container context, but that is not how this is setup. The pre-Knox existing architecture uses ExpressJS within the Angular app hosting container to do a very straightforward proxying of requests to the REST API as opposed to having a heavier weight facade (e.g. a Spring J2EE application) for an abstraction managing those requests to REST. This is fine, but now that we've added Knox to the mix, we should be very clear about what requests and responses go to which hosts/servers and why.\r\n2. Developer documentation - simple diagram and/or write up that expresses what the request/response lifecycle looks like with and without Knox. This relates to number 1, but is more about showing the before/after of enabling Knox.\r\n3. Explanation of the choice to NOT use Knox's URL rewriting capabilities. Per our convo earlier, the choice is between setting a base root that's used by Knox for routing requests (similar to the function of a controller in MVC architecture) to the appropriate host, or leaving the REST application alone and leveraging Knox's regular expression pattern matching to handle rewriting URL's that show up in the client browser.\r\n4. EDIT - Fix logout bug\r\n5. EDIT - Fix Travis Cypress test failure\r\n6. I'm going to make a PR against your PR to add the Management UI to this.\r\n\r\nHere's the basic request/response lifecycle as I understand it:\r\n\r\n**Static asset call for Angular application**\r\n\r\nThis is for javascript, html, and images. I realize \"static\" may be a misnomer for Angular javascript, but it's static insofar as the web container is concerned:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient request\r\n-> knox server\r\n-> angular web server\r\n\r\nServer response\r\n<- angular web server\r\n<- knox server\r\n<- client\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Dynamic/REST content call.**\r\n\r\nKnox is now replacing ExpressJS entirely as the proxy mechanism. Note, ExpressJS didn't perform any function for static assets, only for calls to 3rd parties like the REST app. This is necessary because CORS restricts a browser from making the calls directly to REST (or any other non-origin host that's different from the original host that served up the client-side Angular app). This could theoretically be handled by a proper server side web application, but my understanding is that this would be superfluous given the API contract we've enacted with the REST API, i.e. it handles requests/responses in JSON that an AngularJS application can process easily.\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient request\r\n-> knox server\r\n-> rest api server\r\n\r\nServer response\r\n<- rest api server\r\n<- knox server\r\n<- client\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/446383790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/446391551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1296#issuecomment-446391551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1296","id":446391551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjM5MTU1MQ==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-11T22:45:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T22:45:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought we put that in contrib so that it didn't need to be maintained?

However, in the search box, I can only do \"_id:<blah>\" instead of \"id:blah\", probably because we pass that stuff directly.\r\n\r\nMaking that work in the general case (given that there could be other modifiers), is probably not really worth it, given that it's an id field.\r\n\r\nHowever, are we okay with the user having to know that to find a particular id in the alerts UI they need to do \"_id\"?  It's particularly confusing, because the results of a findOne don't include \"id\" at all (because it's an ES added field, not a Metron document field), and the results of search include \"id\", e.g.\r\n```\r\n\"results\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"AWejNX8L98Y5WuImUxxU\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n          ...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused why the search endpoint returns with \"id', when directly hitting ES returns \"_id\". I don't see anything here that would obviously cause it, but maybe I'm not looking in the right place.\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET \"localhost:9200/bro*/_search?pretty=1\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"terms\": {\r\n      \"_id\": [ \"AWejNX8L98Y5WuImUxxU\" ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\nReturns\r\n```\r\n...\r\n      \"hits\" : [\r\n      {\r\n        ...\r\n        \"_id\" : \"AWejNX8L98Y5WuImUxxU\",\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/446670117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/446671794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1269#issuecomment-446671794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1269","id":446671794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjY3MTc5NA==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-12T17:26:06Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T17:26:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I assume it's unrelated to this PR, but I did want to point out that renaming the metaalert doesn't actually take effect in the Alerts UI pane until something else happens (like a new search, or an escalation).

And you are the sole author of that library?  \r\n\r\nMy only concern is that we need to look at all external dependencies with a critical eye to ensure there is a community backing those.  A community that can provide continued support with bug and security patches.  \r\n\r\nThis is the same approach we have taken when reviewing our web dependencies recently. We've tried to avoid dependencies that don't have that community backing.  Its difficult to make the case to accept simple-syslog as a dependency, when we have turned down other similar single author web dependencies.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a difficult point for me to make being that the sole author of simple-syslog is none other than @ottobackwards who is such an active and important contributor to Metron.\r\n\r\nI am open to a healthy discussion on this.  I could certainly be wrong on this, but I just want to make sure that we are applying the same standards across the project and ensure that the project can outlive any individual

I realized in my testing that for this feature to work correctly, the Knox SSO code should be included so I merged in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1281.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to resolving those merge conflicts, I also added a unit test for the Knox SSO servlet filter and the documentation you requested.  Let me know if the doc makes sense and has enough detail.  I'm also debating copying the testing instructions from this PR into the README as Knox setup instructions.  A follow on PR that adds this feature to the Mpack is going up soon so are manual instructions worth documenting?  I also fixed a couple more UI bugs (login page redirection and the logout bug you mentioned) and tested @sardell's fix in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1301.\r\n\r\nI think that covers points 1, 2, 4, and 5.  For 3, I added an inline comment to index.html explaining the relative base path setting.  Do you still think we need to add something to the README for this?  For 6, I was going to start on it if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nI've updated the PR description with end to end instructions for testing Knox SSO.  I believe this is ready for testing and further review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/447988398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/447988632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1301#issuecomment-447988632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1301","id":447988632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Nzk4ODYzMg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-17T20:32:23Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T20:32:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was able to get a passing test in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 after applying this change.  +1 pending we figure out the travis failure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/447988632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/448008752","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275#issuecomment-448008752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1275","id":448008752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODAwODc1Mg==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-17T21:40:45Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T21:40:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> A follow on PR that adds this feature to the Mpack is going up soon so are manual instructions worth documenting?\r\n\r\nNot necessary.
