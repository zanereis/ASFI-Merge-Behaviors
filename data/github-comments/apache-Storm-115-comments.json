If the hadoop cluster is down at startup, failing the topology seems reasonable.  Without being able to establish a connection to HDFS and open a file there's no guarantee that the submitted configuration would ever work when Hadoop comes back online.  Failing at the outset seems like the better option.</p>\n\n<p>Other
