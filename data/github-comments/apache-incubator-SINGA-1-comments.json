'shared_ptr' adds many characters that usually leads to two lines for one statement.\n\nThis pull request also cleans the API of Layer class:\n- Setup(LayerProto, int npartitions), setup the layer's member data according to user specified configuration. If npartitions > 1, then this layer should be setup as one of npartitions sub-layers.\n- ComputeFeature(Phase, Metric*), now the this function can be used for forward propagation of BP algorithm by passing Phase as kTrain or kForward in BPWorker; It can also be used for the positive phase of CD algorithm by passing Phase as kPositive. The Metric pointer is to collect performance information from this layer. E.g., the loss layers would add metric like loss or accuracy to it.\n- ComputeGradient(Phase), the Phase argument is not used now (neither BP nor CD need this argument), but is added just in case some other algorithms may need it in the future.\n- DebugString(int, Phase), this function is newly added to generate some debug information from one layer. The DebugInfo function of NeuralNet class is removed.\n- ConnectionType dst_layer_connection(), return the connection type of this layer and all dst layers.\n  Currently support two connections: kOneToOne and kOneToMany. kOneToOne indicates the users implement the ComputeFeature and ComputeGradient function considering only one dest layer. In this case, a SplitLayer will be added automatically to connect this layer with all dest layer. kOneToMany indicates the users has already considered multiple dest layers in the implementation. Hence no SplitLayer will be inserted.\n- ConnectionType src_neuron_connection(int k)， return the connection type between one neuron of this layer and its source layer. Currently support two connection types: kOneToOne, and kOneToAll.\n  kOneToOne indicates the neuron depends on only one neuron from src layer. kOneToAll indicates the neuron depends on all neurons from src layer. param k is the index of source layer (current only support k = 0).\n\nThe Metric Class is updated to use Google Protocol buffer as the serialization tool.\n- ToLogString() will print a human readable string, which would be used for logging.\n- ToString() will serialize the metric object into binary string for transmission.\n\nNow the metrics is collected from every layer's ComputeFeature function. Hence the Worker does not need to explicitly collecting metrics from loss layers.

In other words, there is no need to launch the program via `./bin/singa-run.sh`.\n2. for multi-node training, we may need to launch the program as \n   \n   ./bin/singa-run.sh -exec user_main.py -conf cluster.conf\n   \n   The python code, i.e., user_main.py, would create the JobProto object and pass it to Driver::Train.

@ug93tad I think we may rename this pull request to \"Add HDFSStore\".\nHDFSStore provides functions for reading and writing key-value tuples, which is different to KVFileStore. Hence it does not need to be compatible with KVFileStore (i.e., no need to read the file created from KVFileStore). It it similar for KVFileStore and TextFileStore, which are not compatible.\n\nWhen users see \"Add HDFS support\" , they may expect the features as in Hadoop, i.e., uploading their own files and reading it via APIs from HDFS, \nWe may support such feature later. For example, we update the KVFile with an option to read data directly from HDFS.  We can also update the TextFileStore to read data directly from HDFS. Then users can upload the files created by KVFileStore/TextFileStore locally to HDFS, and then read these files at runtime via KVFileStore and TextFileStore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/168169473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/168170280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/96#issuecomment-168170280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/96","id":168170280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODE3MDI4MA==","user":{"login":"ug93tad","id":2044824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDQ4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2044824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad","html_url":"https://github.com/ug93tad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ug93tad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-31T11:01:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-31T11:01:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wangsheng1001
