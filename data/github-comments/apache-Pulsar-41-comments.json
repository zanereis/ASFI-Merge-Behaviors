There's no reason to ever have arquillian and testcontainers in the same module. I would guess you need to create a duplicate integration-tests-base and integration-tests-utils. But then, given that test containers gets rid of the need to have separate modules for the separate topologies, you can just have one test module, and put the utils in that too. So just create tests/integration-tc/ and put everything in that. It can be renamed at the end, when tests/integration is empty.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/399870416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/399996592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/1991#issuecomment-399996592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1991","id":399996592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTk5NjU5Mg==","user":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-25T15:38:28Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T15:38:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jai1 @merlimat I've been looking at how proxyRoles and originalPrincipal work with the data protocol.

The messages are kept for a very short amount of time in memory in the broker and dropped if they cannot be delivered immediately. The data for a single non-persistent topic is not stored in multiple machines.
