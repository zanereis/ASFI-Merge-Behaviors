Can you move the ExampleJSONModule into a formal module that is compiled by the TVM runtime? Because normally, we will need to implement a SaveToBinary and LoadFromBinary instead of pumping things into a DSO file\r\n\r\nThe current implementation expects external codegens to write the JSON string directly to the DSO module so that we can have a unified interface. Do you mean we should also provide the following JSON module other than DSO module for developers to use:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nJSONModule : runtime::Module {\r\n    void SaveToBinary();\r\n    void LoadFromFile();\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, user would have two JSON files if the user invoke json_module.SaveToBinary() and relay.build()? Would this mean that we have to change API of graph_runtime.create() to include the second JSON file?\r\n\r\nAlso, we will generate the following function in the .so.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// JSONModule compatible c function that can be compiled by gcc.\r\nextern \"C\" int foo(TVMValue* value, int *type_code, int nargs, std::string json_file) {\r\n   CHECK_EQ(nargs, 3);\r\n   DLTensor* arg0 = static_cast<DLTensor*>(value.v_handle);\r\n   DLTensor* arg1 = static_cast<DLTensor*>(value.v_handle);\r\n\r\n   // Parse json_file and use \"foo\" as the key to get the subgraph JSON.\r\n  std::string subgraph_json = ...;\r\n\r\n   foo_(static_cast<float*>(args0->data), args0->shape[0],\r\n           static_cast<float*>(args1->data), args1->shape[0]),\r\n           subgraph_json);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that the user codegen is expected to generate the following:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// the original foo you intended to generate\r\nvoid foo_(float* a, int N, float* b, int M, float* c, std::string subgraph_json) {\r\n    // Launch the external engine with subgraph_json and arguements.\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/554579198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/554579203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4305#issuecomment-554579203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4305","id":554579203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDU3OTIwMw==","user":{"login":"petrex","id":699903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/699903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex","html_url":"https://github.com/petrex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petrex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-16T00:15:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T00:15:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Morning @masahi.

In this case we probably don't want to rebuild a different docker for each level of parallelism, which may vary by machine and other factors, so it's not ideal to handle pytest parameters via the Docker build from that perspective.\r\n\r\nI think we can satisfy 1-3 at the same time by having a run_pytest.sh script that is used to run pytest every time and can print out the actual command used. It can be changed without rebuilding the Dockers, it's in one place, so no duplication, it's easy to tell what it's doing and it gets us out of the current business (also before this changer) of encoding into each file how pytest is run. We can even have it print out a command line for how it was run, including any relevant environment variables like TVM_FFI and indeed PYTEST_ADDOPTS if they are non-empty.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/555662599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/555709992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4367#issuecomment-555709992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4367","id":555709992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTcwOTk5Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-19T20:56:25Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T20:56:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"opting for simplicity, perhaps we can just export the necessary env variables in the test script if it is not defined.
