There isn't much else that is really shareable between the two classes, due to subtle differences in how they handle the ends of the lists, as well as the validation checks that they do, at least not without sacrificing efficiency. The `SequenceLexicoder.decodeUnchecked` method is only longer than the equivalent method in `ListLexicoder` because I added some sanity checks and split out some chained function calls that were all on one line in `ListLexicoder` into multiple lines in `SequenceLexicoder` for the sake of code clarity. I could have done the same for `ListLexicoder`, but didn't want to modify code that I wasn't altering the behavior of.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/512070339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/512071809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1257#issuecomment-512071809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1257","id":512071809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjA3MTgwOQ==","user":{"login":"reggert","id":1971881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzE4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1971881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert","html_url":"https://github.com/reggert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T02:09:04Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T02:09:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"On a side note, the automated \"standard\" formatting did some truly horrifying things to a few parts of the code, like splitting\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassert escapedElements.length > 0 : \"ByteUtils.split always returns a minimum of 1 element, even for empty input\";\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassert escapedElements.length\r\n        > 0 : \"ByteUtils.split always returns a minimum of 1 element, even for empty input\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nWho inserts a line break into the middle of a numeric comparison? ;-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/512071809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/512080646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1257#issuecomment-512080646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1257","id":512080646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjA4MDY0Ng==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T02:53:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T03:09:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Most of the heavy lifting is already being done by the `ByteUtils.concat` and `ByteUtils.split` methods, which are called by both implementations, effectively providing the common implementation.

I believe its GC that actually does the deletion of the Metadata tablet file entries and files.  To address your concern about the sorting difference it looks as though the SGC expects the dir to be first in the sort but previous to this the prefix is removed and data resorted so I don't think its an issue.  The only other side effect is that if memory is low before all the deletion candidates can be retrieved then the directory may not be in that set but who cares.

What we're doing here is normalizing the paths to effectively trim out the volume information, so that we don't unintentionally delete a file that was still in use. We want to detect that a file is still in use, even if it looks like it's on a different volume... because it could look like it's on a different volume because of many weird scenarios (such as hostname of the HDFS volume changing or being remapped).\r\n\r\nAt one point, we assumed all files were on a single HDFS volume, so all paths in the metadata were \"relative\" to some root volume (specified by `instance.dfs.uri`, but defaulting to Hadoop's `fs.defaultFS`) and directory (specified by `instance.dfs.dir`, defaulting to `/accumulo`). Old metadata can still be written that way, but new data should be written with the full volume and absolute path to the file in HDFS, because we now support running on top of multiple HDFS volumes (like mounting different disks, say `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb`). So, we need to store more than just the relative paths.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps provide some context for this confusing code. Specifically what it's doing to normalize... I'd have to look at it more carefully, but I think all of it can be ignored for the purposes of this ticket. What matters here is that we have a distinct prefix (to replace the current `~del`), and we normalize whatever we have left after we strip off the prefix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/515173818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/515185133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1043#issuecomment-515185133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1043","id":515185133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTE4NTEzMw==","user":{"login":"hkeebler","id":49656678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjU2Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49656678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler","html_url":"https://github.com/hkeebler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkeebler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T19:38:17Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T19:38:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ctubbsii for the explanation.
