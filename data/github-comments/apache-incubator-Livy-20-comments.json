If the problem involves all interactive sessions, then it is ok, otherwise the fix is probably not the correct one. Can you check if the same issue affects all interactive jobs? If so, I think we can go ahead with this PR, but I would recommend a different reviewer more familiar with the code in rsc, otherwise, the fix needs to be done only on the thriftserver part and we need more investigation to understand why normal interactive sessions do not have the issue while thriftserver has. Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe same issue doesn't affect interactive jobs which created by REST API. The is because the handle functions are different in the driver. The REST API uses `handle(ctx: ChannelHandlerContext, msg: BaseProtocol.ReplJobRequest)` in the ReplDriver while thrift API uses `handle(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, JobRequest<?> msg)` in the RSCDRiver.  \r\nReplDriver changes state when execute code by invoking stateChangedCallback which broadcast the state to all RPC clients. \r\nRSCDriver does not broadcast  state to RPC clients. \r\nI think this patch would not affect other interactive jobs except using thrift API.

The `submit` method is used for many purposes, such as adding jar, files, so I do not think is a good idea to have a fix that has such a large impact on other cases that should not be affected. The current fix would also set to busy when fetching the results, and executing schema operations, and even while unregistering a session...\r\n\r\nI think a better place for the fix would be `SqlJob`, although it is not a perfect solution either.

I think this feature has the following two usage scenarios. \r\n1. When other platforms use JDBC to integrate with Livy, they need to save the session ID and application ID.\r\n2. When the connection creation fails, it may be that the spark session failed to start. At this time, they need to check the reason why the spark session failed to start.\r\nI think it is convenient for users to use one protocol to meet the needs.

I see the\r\nfailure ~25% of the times. As it turned out, the Echo job was returning,\r\nsometimes, even before we added the listener on the job handle. So the\r\nlistener.onJobStarted method is not invoked. This can be fixed in multiple\r\nways but I updated the Echo job, which used to simply return its attribute\r\nvalue, to do what ScalaEcho job is doing. So the Echo job now returns\r\n\"jc.sc().parallelize(list,\r\n1).collect().get(0);\". Even this could still be fast enough to cause the\r\nsame error. However I couldn't reproduce it again. Also the updated code is\r\ntaking ~1 sec or more on spark's side.

There is already a chain of work done on top of it by me and other people who left feedback on this chunk of work. If we make it a part of master I'm 100% sure I won't be the only one pushing Livy project to the world of K8s. Besides that, seeing the progress after the years of waiting would boost the motivation to continue contributions... So, including the upgrade of dependencies to support latest K8s and Spark versions, I propose to tackle those in separate PRs.
