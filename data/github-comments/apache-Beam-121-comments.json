thanks! generally we can trigger all kinds of Jenkins tests if we whisper the right words here, but I think Travis involves pressing the \"Restart Build\" button which _I think_ is only available to

necessary we can always iterate over this again.\r\n\r\nLGTM, pending the green lights.

We can't review this change while that's the case since there's so many other files (and I believe that's what's causing the conflicts error above.) It looks like you did a 'git merge' instead of doing a git 'rebase'. Please fix this PR up so it does not include any changes except what you've done.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/281836744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/281837708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1994#issuecomment-281837708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1994","id":281837708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTgzNzcwOA==","user":{"login":"ssisk","id":707137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/707137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk","html_url":"https://github.com/ssisk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssisk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T23:19:40Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T23:19:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also - I'm thinking it may be easier to break this PR up into chunks and do them each as their own PR.\r\n\r\nSome useful chunks could be: \r\n1) Just check in the core files (HadoopInputFormatIO and HadoopInputFormatIOTest, plus any necessary files for that) \r\n2) add in cassandra unit tests + ITs\r\n3) add in ES unit tests + ITs\r\n4) add in performance tests\r\n\r\nI'm fine with however you want to chunk this up, but I think chunking this change up would make code reviewing much simpler, and speed up the process of getting the changes in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/281837708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/281837909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2078#issuecomment-281837909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2078","id":281837909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTgzNzkwOQ==","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T23:20:38Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T23:20:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Run Dataflow RunnableOnService","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/281837909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
