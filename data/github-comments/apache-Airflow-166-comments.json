The session.merge of the task instance then fails because (at least in postgres) the timestamp with timezone is passed into the query as a full string and so the key no longer matches the database and you get an error and the migration fails:\r\n**'sqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError: UPDATE statement on table 'task_instance' expected to update 1 row(s); 0 were matched.'**\r\n\r\nI don't think that the migration really needs the date - it just needs the primary key and so while for runtime code/etc - I agree 100% that the UtcDateTime should be used. However, I believe in this case since the database during this migration is storing naive dates AND we are only using the date as a value type - it should be safe  to keep naive in the migration code.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can test with mysql and confirm this doesn't cause any new errors.\r\n  * install airflow 1.8 or 1.9\r\n  * run a task (so task_instance table isn't empty)\r\n  * upgrade to 1.10\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/426311793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/426313412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3985#issuecomment-426313412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3985","id":426313412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjMxMzQxMg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T15:16:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T15:16:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh, I was getting the migrations confused.

IMHO at the very least these should be separate things so one can run jobs without creating them.\r\nTo expand on this, we create the jobs using a normal development workflow/CI and we just want to be able to run them from Airflow. IMHO it's not Airflow's responsibility to create resources, it should only invoke them.\r\n\r\nFYI All the unrelated changes are because you merged `master` into your branch instead of rebasing your
