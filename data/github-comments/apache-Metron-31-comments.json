A query within the time range returned results and a query outside of the time range returned a \"No results returned\" message and did not throw an exception.\r\n\r\nI did notice that when I set the query time range to a different day or month a map reduce job still ran.  Is this expected?  I would expect the query map reduce job to be smart enough to exclude files in this case.  That is outside the scope of this PR but wanted to bring it up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/302877713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/302883499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/593#issuecomment-302883499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/593","id":302883499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjg4MzQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-20T16:26:54Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T16:26:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @merrimanr!

METRON-941 fixes an actual bug (parsing is broken with the current code).\"\r\n\r\n@ottobackwards and @justinleet (principles on METRON-962), do you agree we should go ahead and commit this without a viable PaloAltoParser unit test?  Or wait for METRON-962?\r\n\r\n@kylerichardson , what is your opinion on the issue?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/306318125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/306318492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/579#issuecomment-306318492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/579","id":306318492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjMxODQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T21:42:05Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T21:42:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, @ctramnitz , could you please describe in more detail the manual testing you did, which might make us feel better about a commit without unit test?

You basically have the choice of not merging this, resulting in having no unit test and a broken parser, or merging it with still no unit test but having a working parser.
