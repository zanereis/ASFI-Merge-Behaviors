In the case of _zkPath or _topic being null.  There is nothing that explicitly uses them in the constructor.  The failure will happen much later if ever as is the case for _zkPath and _topic, as they appear to only be used as a part of string concatenation with a +.  Which when done with a null writes \"null\" to the string instead of throwing an NPE, so we could end up trying to read from \"/kafka/topics/null/partitions\".</p>\n\n<p>    If something is wrong in a way that we cannot recover from I would much rather throw an exception the moment we know it is wrong rather than log an error and hope that the exception will be thrown later on, or that somehow we will manage to not actually need this config to be set. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612517037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/97513417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/534#issuecomment-97513417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/534","id":97513417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NTEzNDE3","user":{"login":"knusbaum","id":1819836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTk4MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1819836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum","html_url":"https://github.com/knusbaum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T17:33:13Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T17:34:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm generally in favor of this.

Following are the observations we made in our cluster after the upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>We ran the test in a 4 node cluster, 1 master and 3 worker nodes. </p>\n\n<p>We created a topology with 2 worker and 4 executors which means each worker gets 2 executors. We were causing a fatal in PHP which would cause the executor to die and it would eventually shut down the worker that spawn the executor in 0.9.3. We would see the worker which is up trying to reconnect to a new worker and sometimes even establish the connection successfully but would later shut down too with the Async loop dies message as seen in the <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329\" title=\"Fix cascading Storm failure by improving reconnection strategy and buffering messages\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-329\"><del>STORM-329</del></a>. So what we noticed was that the 3 workers kept going down randomly due to the cascading failure and were unable to achieve a steady state for a couple of minutes. We ran this same test case on 0.9.4 and even though the PHP fatal caused 1 worker to shut down the other was still up and running without crashing.</p>\n\n<p>So I am quite positive that <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-329\" title=\"Fix cascading Storm failure by improving reconnection strategy and buffering messages\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-329\"><del>STORM-329</del></a> fixes the issue in this thread.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you need any additional info.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612477581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612481798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4278#issuecomment-2612481798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4278","id":2612481798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0ODE3OTg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T19:02:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:02:12Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user danielcompton commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/534#discussion_r29368825\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/534#discussion_r29368825</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/command/dev_zookeeper.clj &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -14,13 +14,15 @@<br/>\n     ;; See the License for the specific language governing permissions and<br/>\n     ;; limitations under the License.<br/>\n     (ns backtype.storm.command.dev-zookeeper</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>(:use <span class=\"error\">&#91;backtype.storm zookeeper util config&#93;</span>)<br/>\n    +  (:require <span class=\"error\">&#91;backtype.storm.zookeeper :as zoo&#93;</span><br/>\n    +    <span class=\"error\">&#91;backtype.storm.config :as config&#93;</span>)<br/>\n    +  (:use <span class=\"error\">&#91;backtype.storm util &#93;</span>)\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    The plan is to get rid of all :use's, I had missed this one.
