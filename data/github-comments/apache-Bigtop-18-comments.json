+1, tested on Debian 10 x86_64.\r\n\r\n@sekikn - Would you be able to share your build and testing method for Debian 10 please?\r\n\r\nI'm getting a build failure for Debian 10 x86_64 and I'd be interested to know if I'm doing something wrong before I go and create a JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\nThe command I'm using is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run --rm  -v `pwd`:/ws --workdir /ws

like missing binaries, so perhaps there was an earlier linker error.\r\n```\r\n+ cp '/build/libexec/*' debian/tmp/usr/lib/hadoop/libexec//\r\ncp: cannot stat '/build/libexec/*': No such file or
