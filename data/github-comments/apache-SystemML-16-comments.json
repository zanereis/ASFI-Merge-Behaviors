In order to show the relationship to transformencode, you can mention that transformencode := build+apply, whereas transformapply := apply\n- meta data as frames: please highlight (maybe in the transformencode example) that the meta data is simply a frame and hence all operations and read/write can similarly be applied to the meta data too.\n- toString: it would be good to either extend the description of toString (to support frame inputs) or include it under frames too (its included in the examples but the tables are the actual language reference)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/252139779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/252155035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/268#issuecomment-252155035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/268","id":252155035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjE1NTAzNQ==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-07T05:16:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T05:16:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you very much @mboehm7  for your input and time!

For this particular case pushing down for-loops, I'd like to step back and discuss other possible ideas.\n\nIn this case, we are assuming that we need to push the actual loop down into DML.  Overall, I'm concerned that the current prototype could end up causing problems due to users not understanding what subset of Python could be used within the function.  As an alternative, what if we instead only defined the graph of operations for a single iteration, and then evaluated that graph repeatedly in a Python for-loop?  For example:\n\n``` r\n// Starting values\nV = .... // some input data converted to a SystemML Matrix\nW = sml.random.uniform(size=(m, k))\nH = sml.random.uniform(size=(k, n))\n\n// Train in a loop\nfor i in range(0, 200):\n  H = H * dot(W.transpose(), V)/dot(W.transpose(), dot(W, H))\n  W = W * dot(V, H.transpose())/dot(W, dot(H, H.transpose()))\n  sml.eval(W, H)  // Eval the graph so that W & H are evaluated, starting with their previous values\n\n// Now, W & H have the final values in SystemML matrix objects, which we can convert to NumPy:\nW = W.toNumPy()\nH = H.toNumPy()\n```\n\nWe could also define the graph of operations for a single iteration outside of the for loop:\n\n``` r\n// Starting values\nV = .... // some input data converted to a SystemML Matrix\nW = sml.random.uniform(size=(m, k))\nH = sml.random.uniform(size=(k, n))\n\n// Graph of operations for a single iteration\nH = H * dot(W.transpose(), V)/dot(W.transpose(), dot(W, H))\nW = W * dot(V, H.transpose())/dot(W, dot(H, H.transpose()))\n\n// Train in a loop\nfor i in range(0, 200):\n  sml.eval(W, H)  // Eval the graph so that W & H are evaluated, starting with their previous values\n\n// Now, W & H contain their final values in SystemML matrix objects, which we can convert to NumPy, for example:\nW = W.toNumPy()\nH = H.toNumPy()\n```\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/254369383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/254542201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/269#issuecomment-254542201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/269","id":254542201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDU0MjIwMQ==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T15:22:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T15:22:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All tests are now passing at [PR build 730](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/730/).

I should have clarified it before, but the code snippets I gave don't necessarily work, but reflect different possible designs and what they might look like in practice.\n\n\"It important to note that this is limitation of PyDML (and by transitive property DML) not parallelize construct.\" -> Yes, you are technically correct that this is a limitation of PyDML.  The problem I was identifying is just that -- a user of this parallelize construct would have to know the exact subset of Python that would work with PyDML, and any deviation from it would cause errors.  Thus, although we are allowing the user to literally use Python, in reality, we are forcing them to learn which subset of Python corresponds to the underlying PyDML.\n\nWith regards to \"Imran said that this approach did not yield satisfactory performance for NMF script\", the problem was not that the performance was slightly unsatisfactory, but rather that it was essentially broken.  Evaluation of `H` was quick as it should be, but then the subsequent evaluation of `W` took over an hour to finish, despite using almost the same operations.  This occurred when the graph was constructed within the loop and then executed once at the end.  I would suggest we first explore the root cause of that issue.  Once we figure out that issue, the remaining step would be to identify the magnitude of the performance improvements gained via loop optimizations.\n\nRegarding the graph of operations outside of the for loop, yes that won't work today (noted above -- should have added that to the original post).  It represents another possible design, where the idea would be to define what the operations would be, starting with an initial set of values, and then allow for that graph to be executed as many times as desired.  Therefore, we start with initial values of `H` and `W`, then define update operations, then evaluate a single set of update steps repeatedly within the loop.  Basically, this would be similar to a TensorFlow style.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/254580618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/254586367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/270#issuecomment-254586367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/270","id":254586367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDU4NjM2Nw==","user":{"login":"fschueler","id":4837217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler","html_url":"https://github.com/fschueler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T17:52:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T17:52:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"If Imran's concern is about the decorator, maybe we could think about going back to making the iteration a (set of) special function(s) like `sml.iterate(...)`? \nThis way the user wouldn't have to define her own function (`def push_down_loop(inputs, outputs)`) where for me it is not clear right now if the function signature is unrestricted or if I could annotate arbitrary functions with @sml.parallelize.\nFor convenience it might also be possible to inspect the closure of a `sml.iterate(...)` function and set inputs automatically?

If on the other hand, we want to support a given deviation, I would prefer to extend PyDML/DML itself than make Python DSL more complex. \n\nTo be fair, two kinds of deviation that are not handled (but potentially possible): \n1. Subset of operations in loop to be pushed down to SystemML and subset of operations executed in Python as external builtin function. This requires traversal of AST and I decided not to go in that direction for now; instead I added a restriction that we cannot only push-down the subset of Python which maps to PyDML.\n2. Handling of `sml` imports.\n\nMy understanding is that Imran's code didnot break down after adding `eval(H, W)` in the for loop, but was much slower. If that is not the case, then I agree with you, we need to understand the root cause of the problem.\n\n@fschueler The signature of push-down loop is restricted. In current setup, we can examine the closure too by traversing the AST without a need for new construct. In my earlier PR, I had proposed adding a new construct `FOR` instead of `iterate` and it was not well-received.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/254589571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/254591841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/270#issuecomment-254591841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/270","id":254591841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDU5MTg0MQ==","user":{"login":"iyounus","id":8313847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTM4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8313847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus","html_url":"https://github.com/iyounus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T18:11:51Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T18:11:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"eval(H,W) did not have any effect on the calculation of W.

If users want to match strings with different escaping policies to the same entry it's the user's responsibility to handle the unquoting. The nice side effect is that transformencode/transformapply and transformdecode are truly inverse operations, at least for reversible transformations like recoding and dummy coding.\n\n2) Metadata frames: The schema for meta data frames is a string column per original column where each transformation type has its special serialization format. For example, for recoding, we serialize distinct {token}{delim}{code} (one entry per row). The reason why we use the quote-aware splitting on parsing this meta data is a best effort to handle cases where {delim} occurs inside the quoted token. A simply splitting on {delim} (as done in the \"fix\" by PR 274) would fail in this situation.\n\n3) Solution: We could, however, simply flip the serialization format to {code}{delim}{token} which allows splitting on the first occurrence of {delim} because {code} is guaranteed not to include {delim}. Note that this would loose binary backwards compatibility to existing meta data frames though. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/255519485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/255538570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/274#issuecomment-255538570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/274","id":255538570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTUzODU3MA==","user":{"login":"asurve","id":13441665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDQxNjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13441665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve","html_url":"https://github.com/asurve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asurve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-22T16:34:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T16:47:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"1.

Maximizing code reuse by deriving from BaseSystemMLClassifier or BaseSystemMLRegressor (or you can add a new Base class).\n\nThe above 3 points simplifies the integration with Python wrappers (i.e. mllearn - supports not just DataFrame but also NumPy/SciPy/Pandas DF) and will also help in maintaining the wrappers.

@lresende @bertholdreinwald \n\nHere are some issues to be aware of with this approach:\n\n1) Binding to the \"post-integration-test\" phase of the maven lifecycle.\nThe maven standard is to have build artifacts with the \"package\" phase of the maven lifecycle.\n\n2) All other artifacts (besides main jar, sources jar, and javadoc jar) use the assembly plugin to create them. This uses exec-maven-plugin to execute python, which is a totally different pathway. It also means that if you don't have python installed, you can't build this artifact.\n\n3) The other artifacts contain their LICENSEs at src/assembly/*. This artifact has its LICENSE at src/main/python/. This spreads build information to different locations rather than keeping it localized in src/assembly.\n\n4) If you run \"mvn post-integration-test -P distribution -DskipTests\", this artifact does not end up in the target directory like a normal artifact. It ends up in src/main/python/dist. This is not standard.\n\n5) As a result of 4, if you do a \"mvn clean\", this artifact does not get deleted. Not being able to clean the artifact is confusing to maven users. Also, it can typically lead to artifacts that aren't built correctly.\n\n6) If I build, the artifact generated is called \"systemml-incubating-0.11.0.dev1.tar.gz\". However, all the other artifacts in target are called \"systemml-0.12.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT*\". This means the version number for this artifact must not be coming from the pom. This makes it hard to maintain.\n\n7) What is \"dev1\"? Is that a python standard? I do not understand what \"dev1\" means.\n\n8) The \"systemml-0.11.0.dev6.tar.gz\" that was on pypi contained the \"SystemML.jar\" in it at systemml/systemml-java/.

I would highly appreciate if you could help with issues 1, 5, 6, 8 and 9.\n\n> 1) Binding to the \"post-integration-test\" phase of the maven lifecycle.\n> The maven standard is to have build artifacts with the \"package\" phase of the maven lifecycle.\n\nYes, I could not find an easy way to ensure that SystemML.jar is created before the `generate-python-package` is invoked in package phase. \n\n> 2) All other artifacts (besides main jar, sources jar, and javadoc jar) use the assembly plugin to create them. This uses exec-maven-plugin to execute python, which is a totally different pathway. It also means that if you don't have python installed, you can't build this artifact.\n\nThat is correct. The profile `distribution` now requires that python is installed because SystemML python package is now a part of the distribution.\n\n> 3) The other artifacts contain their LICENSEs at src/assembly/*. This artifact has its LICENSE at src/main/python/. This spreads build information to different locations rather than keeping it localized in src/assembly.\n\nThis was to address the issue raised by Apache mentors, they explictly wanted the LICENSE to be included in the root folder of tgz. @lresende : Can you please double-check this ?\n\n> 4) If you run \"mvn post-integration-test -P distribution -DskipTests\", this artifact does not end up in the target directory like a normal artifact. It ends up in src/main/python/dist. This is not standard.\n\nThat is python's standard location for building the artifact. I understand here we have to chose whether to follow maven standard location or python standard location and I am fine with either.\n\n> 5) As a result of 4, if you do a \"mvn clean\", this artifact does not get deleted. Not being able to clean the artifact is confusing to maven users. Also, it can typically lead to artifacts that aren't built correctly.\n\nGood point. \n\n> 6) If I build, the artifact generated is called \"systemml-incubating-0.11.0.dev1.tar.gz\". However, all the other artifacts in target are called \"systemml-0.12.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT*\". This means the version number for this artifact must not be coming from the pom. This makes it hard to maintain.\n\nGood catch. We need to update the setup.py to get 0.12.0\n\n> 7) What is \"dev1\"? Is that a python standard? I do not understand what \"dev1\" means.\n\nYes.\n\n> 8) The \"systemml-0.11.0.dev6.tar.gz\" that was on pypi contained the \"SystemML.jar\" in it at systemml/systemml-java/. This \"systemml-incubating-0.11.0.dev1.tar.gz\" is 23K and does not contain the systemml jar file. Is it supposed to contain the SystemML jar file like it did before?\n\nYes, the new tgz should have same layout as systemml-0.11.0.dev6.tar.gz.\n\n> 9) If the artifact is supposed to contain the SystemML jar file, then the LICENSE needs to be updated to reflect that it contains the antlr runtime and wink dependencies in it. If it is not supposed to contain the SystemML jar file, then it is fine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/261385604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/261389654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/289#issuecomment-261389654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/289","id":261389654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTM4OTY1NA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-17T22:26:22Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T22:26:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
