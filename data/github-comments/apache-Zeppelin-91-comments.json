@Leemoonsoo \nSorry for my late response. I spent some time to test various cases on the different OS.\nI think it's ready for review(CI is green at last!). \nI updated the PR description accordingly. Hope it helps you to remind the purpose of this PR :)\n\nHere is the list of changes after my initial commits\n- Directory of Spark bin\n  I changed the dir of Spark bin from `interpreter/spark/` to `local-spark`. Since `mvn clean` will remove `interpreter/`, users will see “Do you want to download local Spark?” whenever they re-build and restart Zeppelin. So I think creating a new dir(`local-spark`) would be better in this case.\n- Supporting Windows users\n  I wanted to create `download-spark.cmd` for Windows. But sadly we can’t use many shell commands such as `curl`, `tar` and `sed` in the batch script. It was hard to find 100% compatible commands for Windows. Maybe we can guide the Windows users to install those commands by themselves, but it’s a bit overdoing i think. Actually `download-spark` script is only for downloading the latest version of Spark and setting `SPARK_HOME`. So I updated some docs to explain this as a alternative way. \n- Documentations\n  I think it’s quite big change that ppl need to enter “Yes/No” when they start Zeppelin. Even though it’s only one time. So I updated `README.md`, `install.md` and `spark.md`. For example, the below screenshot is `spark.md`. \n  <img width=\"741\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-23 at 2 04 18 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/18758441/14686112-8133-11e6-9b19-8703cb6ab496.png\">\n\nAnd as @bzz said before, \n\n> How about EMR\\Dataproc\\Juju\\BigTop users, will the proposed change affect them? \n\nDo we need to provide this local Spark mode for them? Actually it's my question.. :D \nPlease feel free to point me for anything if it's needed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/247042412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/247043265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1422#issuecomment-247043265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1422","id":247043265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzA0MzI2NQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T15:03:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T15:03:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM
