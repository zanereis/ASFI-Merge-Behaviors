Not only about TopK operator, i think it's also very important for users or DSLs to build more robust and efficient applications. For example, in Table API queries, as the data schema is predictable during each phase of processing, we does not need to create real `Row` object, just store the binary data in self managed memory, and use the offset to read `Row` fields. So all the intermediate data is store as binary on self managed memory, no need to create lots of `Row` object and its fields object anymore, which should be more robust, memory-efficient, and with better performance. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/161501441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/161608168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1386#issuecomment-161608168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1386","id":161608168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTYwODE2OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T11:48:34Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T11:48:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As far as I can see from these changes, introducing a `TaskInfo` will completely subsume this change here and change every line again.\n\nYou are right, usually different issues should go into different pull requests.

Fabian\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/161725286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/161910704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1418#issuecomment-161910704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1418","id":161910704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTkxMDcwNA==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T08:50:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T08:50:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

It is impossible for me to see what you've actually changed with your last commit.\n\nConcerning the REST test case, I assume that you have to start a `JobManager` with the `WebRuntimeMonitor` running. Then you submit a job and send a stop request to the web interface. I would assume that you can use any HTTP client for that. Afterwards you can check the JSON result and verify that the job has actually been stopped. That you can also directly do by querying the `JobManager`.\n\nIt would be important to also add such a test for the yarn use case.

When the job was stopped when it was still in the state `SCHEDULED` or `DEPLOYING`, then one received a `StoppingSuccess`. The problem was that the stop was not executed and the job later switched to `RUNNING`.\n\nThe same can be observed if the job is in state `RESTARTING`. Stopping a restarting job does nothing even though you receive a `StoppingSuccess` message. The job will later be redeployed. \n\nAs a user I would expect that the job is immediately stopped or at least at the next possible moment (e.g. when it's deployed). Or I would expect that the system tells me that the stopping is at the moment not possible.\n\nSimilar is the question, what happens if only a subset of all sources is deployed and in the state `RUNNING`. This would mean that the undeployed sources won't get noticed about the stopping signal and, thus, be normally deployed. \n\nFurthermore, what happens if the `stop` method of the `SourceFunction` throws an unchecked exception? If I'm not mistaken, then this will only get logged. But shouldn't the task be cancelled in such a situation because the state cannot be guaranteed to be consistent anymore?\n\nThe case that a `Task` is not `Stoppable` and that a `Task` cannot be found on the `TaskManager` are treated by the `Execution` identically. Both cases cause a `TaskOperationResult(executionID, false, message)` to be sent back to the `Execution`. There it will be logged that the stopping call \"did not find the task\". I think it would be good to differentiate the two cases. The former case should actually lead to a `StoppingFailure`, shouldn't it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/161949525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/161969662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1098#issuecomment-161969662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1098","id":161969662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTk2OTY2Mg==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-04T13:36:09Z","updated_at":"2015-12-04T13:36:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Apparently, you're no longer up for the task.

Exposing Managed Memory to UDFs (this pull request), which is much more convenient than going through the implementation of a deeply integrated operator.\n2. Efficiency for APIs like the Table API. The Table API works on managed memory already, since it sits on top of Flinks join/sort/etc. What you are hinting at is to have a lower level interface where functions gets the memory segments, rather than the row objects, and directly works on the memory segments. That has been a long which of mine as well, but that involves having a separate type of functions that support working with memory segments. Plus more, to handle records that are too large to fit into individual segments.\n\nI am still onto point (1). I aimed a bit too high with how I wanted to abstract that, but will continue.\n\nI would love to see point (2) at some point. If you are eager in driving point (2), I'd be very happy.

There is no common value between statistics value for continuous and that for discrete.
