For even more detailed info, you can read about OpenJ9 performance at https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/oj9_performance.html .\r\n\r\nQuick summary is: start-up can be 30%-40% faster and, depending on how you run, JVM resident footprint can be 40-60% less. If peak throughput isn't your highest priority, then options like -Xtune:virtualized can dramatically accelerate your ramp-up time particularly in memory or CPU constrained environments (see https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/oj9_performance.html#g5). And that's with fully open source, independently JCK8-certified builds from AdoptOpenJDK.\r\n\r\nI'm not arguing that makes up for the tooling issues that have also been raised here; I'm just responding primarily to the \"I know nothing about openj9\" comment :) .\r\n\r\nHope that helps!
