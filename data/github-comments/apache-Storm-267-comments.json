Not that we need it right now, but just that I would like to see how you would fit it in, because I can see how I might do it, but I would like to hear from others about it.\r\n\r\nRight now the stateful operations (aggregations, join etc) uses an in-memory map to maintain state and relies on storm's acking mechanism to replay and rebuild the state. For exactly once we can build support at the storm framework level (e.g. enhance the stateful bolts) so that operations like aggregations and join can use the underlying framework state to maintain its state.
