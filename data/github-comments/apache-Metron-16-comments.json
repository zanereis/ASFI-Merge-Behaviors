had hit the first two, but not the last.  I just setup an additional manual test that covers all of these scenarios.  More specifically, here are the profiles that I defined.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"counter\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"init\":  { \"s\": 0 },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"s\": \"s + 1\" },\r\n      \"result\":  \"s\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"by-ip\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n      \"init\":  { \"s\": 0 },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"s\": \"s + 1\" },\r\n      \"result\":  \"s\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"always-zero\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n      \"init\":  { \"s\": 0 },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"s\": 0 },\r\n      \"result\":  \"s\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of the profiles counts messages that it sees \"globally\", the next counts the number of messages by source IP, and the last likes to always zero-out the same variable named \"s\", just to see if it can muck with the other two profiles.  \r\n\r\nThe `always-zero` profile as expected remains 0.  I can see additional values being written as time progresses.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"always-zero\",\"72.34.49.86\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[0, 0]\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"always-zero\",\"72.34.49.86\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[0, 0, 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these profiles share the same variable 's', so if there was some kind of bad intermingling, I would expect the `always-zero` profile to seriously muck things up for the other two profiles.  But I do not see any of that.  \r\n\r\nI can see new values being added to the `by-ip` profile.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"by-ip\",\"72.34.49.86\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[10.0, 106.0]\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"by-ip\",\"72.34.49.86\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[10.0, 106.0, 58.0]\r\n\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"by-ip\",\"192.168.138.158\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[296.0, 303.0, 302.0]\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"by-ip\",\"192.168.138.158\", 7, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[296.0, 303.0, 302.0, 303.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"global\" profile is also behaving properly.\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"counter\",\"global\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[833.0, 319.0, 746.0]\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"counter\",\"global\", 6, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[833.0, 319.0, 746.0, 1538.0]\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/264938635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/264938996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/387#issuecomment-264938996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/387","id":264938996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDkzODk5Ng==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-05T18:43:18Z","updated_at":"2016-12-05T18:43:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, I'm in.  +1 by inspection.

My guess is that we'd be good with UTF-8, but it's large enough to be it's own separate discussion. Assuming people agree, I'll create a separate ticket.\r\n\r\nHighlights.  In addition, a couple things that were in the neighborhood got touched.\r\n\r\n- `@Override` added throughout. A couple can't be, because they're in generated code. http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MissingOverride\r\n- `QueueHandler.java` get a type on the internal Queue.  Just happened to catch it going be.  Nothing changes externally, just carries over the ZKQueue type.\r\n- A couple classes (e.g. `ContainerTracker` and `PersistentAccessTracker`) have fields changed to final for synchronization. http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/SynchronizeOnNonFinalField\r\n- `SimpleFieldTransformation` fixed logic.  Don't remember which Error Prone warning this was, because the answer was to remove the chunk of offending code entirely.\r\n- Lot of things are unboxed (e.g. Boolean to boolean). http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/BoxedPrimitiveConstructor\r\n- Couple of inner classes are made static because they don't depend on the enclosing class at all. http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ClassCanBeStatic\r\n- `newInstance()` generally changed to `getConstructor().newInstance()`.  Added catches where appropriate. http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ClassNewInstance\r\n- `FluxTopologyComponent` has try-finally rewritten to use try with resources. Integration tests still work. http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/Finally\r\n\r\nThere's a couple miscellaneous leftover things, most notably:\r\n```\r\n/Users/jleet/Documents/workspace/incubator-metron/metron-analytics/metron-maas-service/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/maas/service/runner/Runner.java:265: warning: [Finally] If you return or throw from a finally, then values returned or thrown from the try-catch block will be ignored. Consider using try-with-resources instead.\r\n           throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unable to execute \" + script + \".  Stderr is: \" + stderr + \"\\nStdout is: \" + stdout);\r\n           ^ \r\n    (see http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/Finally) Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations. Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.\r\n```\r\nI wasn't sure enough of what was going on, so I punted, given how large the PR already is.\r\n\r\nAlong with this, there are a couple instances of http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TypeParameterUnusedInFormals in helper code that I'm not terribly worried about, but we might want to take a look at (and possibly explicitly suppress)\r\n\r\nTesting for this was making sure all the unit and integration tests still work (given that most changes are things like `@Override` that don't have actual execution effect) + ensuring things can still flow through topologies correctly.  The largest change is is the `FluxTopologyComponent`, whose usage is in integration tests and should be covered by that.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we could probably upgrade several of these to errors if we wanted to, specifically SynchronizeOnNonFinalField, BoxedPrimitiveConstructor, ClassCanBeStatic, and ClassNewInstance I believe are all gone.  Unfortunately, because of the generated code MissingOverride is here to stay.  I could do that in either this ticket if we're interested or in a follow-on.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/265172896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/265194531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/388#issuecomment-265194531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/388","id":265194531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTE5NDUzMQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T16:20:21Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T16:20:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, I tested this in vagrant.  The testing methodology was as follows:\r\n* Created a simple global profile that adds a `value` field to a stats object and serializes it:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"stats\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"true\",\r\n      \"init\" : {\r\n        \"s\": \"STATS_INIT()\"\r\n               },\r\n      \"update\": {\r\n

the mean from the last 10 minute window:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\"\r\n ,\"sensorTopic\" : \"mad\"\r\n ,\"parserConfig\" : {\r\n    \"columns\"

\"index\": \"mad\",\r\n  \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n  \"enrichment\": {\r\n    \"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"stellar\" : {\r\n        \"config\" : {\r\n          \"enrichment_mean\" :

form `value,type` (e.g. 2.45,synthetic)\r\n* Open up the stellar shell after 10 minutes and run `STATS_MEAN(STATS_MERGE(PROFILE_GET('stats', 'global', 10, 'MINUTES')))` and ensure I get something that is not `NaN`\r\n\r\nThis ensures that statistics objects are able to be serialized and deserialized correctly from the:\r\n* Enrichment topology\r\n* Parser topology\r\n* Stellar

There are definite benefits to doing an upgrade to Ansible (whether to 2.1 or 2.2).  One of many would be the ability to use the [debug feature](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_debugger.html) for troubleshooting.  I validated that there is pretty widespread support for both 2.1 and 2.2.  Specifically, I quickly looked at:\r\n * [brew](http://braumeister.org/formula/ansible)\r\n * pip (via `pip install ansible==`)\r\n * [apt-get](https://launchpad.net/~ansible/+archive/ubuntu/ansible) for Ubuntu (and probably others)\r\n * yum (via `yum list ansible` with `epel` configured)\r\n\r\nThat makes me think it may be more worthwhile to jump to 2.2 instead of 2.1, but I'm mostly indifferent.\r\n\r\nIs there a large emphasis on having backwards compatible playbooks?  Personally I'm not so concerned about that, as long as we do a good job documenting and **announcing** the upgrade, but I'd be interested to see in what situations that's important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/266037798/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/266038596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/392#issuecomment-266038596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/392","id":266038596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjAzODU5Ng==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-09T15:18:58Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T15:18:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cestella  - should I be able to do TO_FLOAT(field) when the field is a string and could be 1231 or 12.31?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/266038596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/266039378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/392#issuecomment-266039378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/392","id":266039378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjAzOTM3OA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-09T15:22:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T15:22:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ottobackwards  Yep, the `TO_$TYPE` stellar functions should work with inputs that are strings or numbers of other types.

Also, I had some concerns in a scenario where two integers were added, a long was automatically created from them, and then passed to a function that only accepts integers.

want to provide some feedback on @cestella comments on changes to the Profiler Client API.  Before I do that I want to make sure that we're all on the same page about usage scenarios for this functionality.\r\n\r\n##### \"Live\" Data\r\n\r\nThe most common use case is creating profiles on live, streaming data.  In this case the processing time and event time will normally remain close, but could differ under abnormal conditions.  \r\n\r\nNote that it is still very valuable to use event time processing in this scenario. Using event time here has the following advantages.\r\n * Profiles are not skewed by high demand that might delay processing\r\n * Allows the Profiler to take planned/unplanned outages and pick up where it left off\r\n * Produces more accurate behavioral profiles when there is a time difference between when a behavior occurs and when the telemetry produced to tell us about that behavior is received.  For example, think of a sensor that collects data in batches or mini-batches where we get data on regular intervals; every 10 minutes, hourly, etc.\r\n\r\n##### Replayed Data\r\n\r\nThe other use case that this positions us for is creating profiles from replayed or reprocessed archival data.  I am creating a model based on a new feature that the Profiler is generating for me.  When I move that model into Production, I need a historical view of that feature, to train my model.  I can replay archived telemetry through the Profiler generating that history of my new feature.

I think this is the most simple function signature to use in this case.\r\n\r\nFor the **Replayed Data** use case, the existing `PROFILE_GET` signature is not going to work.  To query the Profiler for replayed data, we need one or both of the following functions.  Or maybe there is a better function signature that I'm not thinking of.\r\n\r\n#### PROFILE_GET_RANGE\r\n\r\nReturn the measurements taken for a profile and entity between a range of time defined by a start and end.  \r\n\r\nThe only problem here is how do I make it easy for the user to specify a timestamp?  Do I have to accept a number of different formats and try to coerce to a timestamp?  What formats should I accept?\r\n\r\n```\r\nPROFILE_GET_RANGE(profile, entity, start timestamp, end timestamp)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PROFILE_GET_FROM\r\nReturn the measurements taken for a profile and entity starting from a point in time, the offset, and looking back from that offset.

I like your signature for `PROFILE_GET_FROM`: `PROFILE_GET_FROM(profile, entity, look-back, offset)` but your example usage, `PROFILE_GET_FROM('replayed-profile', '10.0.0.1', 15, \"MINUTES\", 2, \"MONTHS\")` doesn't appear to fit (the last 2 args aren't an offset).  I'd expect `offset` to be a timestamp and if you want to do things like figure out which timestamp to use, you'd do it with other stellar functions.  So, for instance, I'd imagine your example as:\r\n`PROFILE_GET_FROM('replayed-profile', '10.0.0.1', 15, \"MINUTES\", DATE_SUBTRACT(timestamp, 2, \"MONTHS\"))` where `DATE_SUBTRACT` subtracts 2 months from the timestamp of the data and returns that timestamp.  \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense at all?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/267356758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/267368357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/395#issuecomment-267368357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/395","id":267368357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzM2ODM1Nw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T16:13:23Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T16:13:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, your example makes sense.

We currently plop the whole lot of Stellar documentation in the metron-common README and I wonder if we should start splitting any of this out into separate md files.

I like @cestella 's recommendation of using the profiler for an end-to-end test. This really gets at illustrating the value from a user/customer perspective. \r\n\r\nI think we want to consider how we choose to use the Metron wiki vs the README files.
