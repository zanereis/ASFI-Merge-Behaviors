23ae5eca871bde2599f86cebfe9971cb08584bf9\r\nAuthor: Ali Ahmed <alahmed.se@gmail.com>\r\nDate:   Sat Jan 4 18:30:34 2020 -0800\r\n\r\n    Make docker files consistent. (#5949)\r\n    \r\n    Allow volume override for docker commands\r\n    with env variable, this allows the scripts to\r\n    work in dind environments.\r\n\r\ncommit f95c71f21aae9e8299597295ccb2bc6954d82ae5\r\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\r\nDate:   Sat Jan 4 04:25:04 2020 -0800\r\n\r\n    Make standalone to advertise \"localhost\" to avoid failure when hostname is not resolvable (#5856)\r\n    \r\n    ### Motivation\r\n    \r\n    The standalone service is failing to startup when the hostname is not resolvable to an IP. This is common in laptops.\r\n    \r\n    The reason is that the function worker in standalone is trying to connect to the advertised address rather than \"localhost\".\r\n    \r\n    To fix this, we should make the standalone to always advertise \"localhost\" as the the broker address. This is ok because in any case the standalone treats the advertisement as the pulsar proxy, in that it forces the clients to always go through the same service url, so a client connecting from a different host won't have problems.\r\n\r\ncommit 88fc454173af94d33986e608e94037db556a9226\r\nAuthor: Jia Zhai <zhaijia@apache.org>\r\nDate:   Fri Jan 3 23:47:21 2020 +0800\r\n\r\n    fix reader builder clone error (#5923)\r\n    \r\n    Motivation\r\n    In reader builder, clone() method does not clone the config, and will cause error once we call a builder.clone() concurrently to create readers. This PR mainly try to fix this issue.\r\n    \r\n    Modifications\r\n    use conf.clone(), to make sure conf is cloned.\r\n    add test to verify it.\r\n    fix other small issues, like get() methods, and access level, make it align with consumer/producer builder.\r\n    Verifying this change\r\n    ut passed.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570991262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570991885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5987#issuecomment-570991885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5987","id":570991885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDk5MTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-06T03:42:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T03:42:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Fransvanierland not quite follow this requirements, what is the priority mainly used for?
