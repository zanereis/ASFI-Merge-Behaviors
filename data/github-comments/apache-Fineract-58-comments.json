Please have a word with @bharathc27 and provide a better explanation of this functionality and behaviour!\r\n\r\nThe Balloon amount is just the principal amount that you want to have in the last installment, so in this case is 800 but we need to add the rest of this last installment (maybe fees, interest, etc) so that is why this is not exactly 800.

... ignore my last comment... my message was too long for the mailing list (arrrrrgh)... so, let's try here:\r\n\r\n... counter argument: while we are at it we might as well tackle existing tech debt instead of moving it just in front of us and postponing the handling of it. My impression is that the current emphasis is still on adding new features and less on tackling improving the code (and runtime) quality of Fineract. It's going to be hard (very) to ever catch up if we continue like that.\r\n\r\nLet's take your client search (v2) example:\r\n\r\n- fair enough, introduces types\r\n- gets rid of all those (manually maintainable) dummy Java classes to reintroduce type information for OpenApi\r\n- finally IDE refactoring tools will work\r\n\r\n... but...\r\n\r\n- does not follow the architecture \"rules\" of current Fineract\r\n- uses \"domain\" (which everywhere else is used for database table mapping), but means \"data\"\r\n- these new data structures are created in the service package... why not in the existing \"domain\" (to stay with current reasoning here) or better in the \"data\" package?\r\n- if we have these new JAR \"modules\": why not put these new data structures/classes in the fineract-core module, but instead they are buried in fineract-provider?\r\n- not sure where the permissions are enforced? maybe in web security config, I personally prefer that, because then you have one place to audit/check if necessary... and it gets rid of these explicit security service checks (which in turn call all those \"utility\" functions on AppUser... where they are really misplaced)\r\n- not sure if I understand why the \"delegate\" is needed... ok, just a detail\r\n- the example that you give is an easy one: read requests... Zeyad started also tackling a read request for a very small service (note), because those are simple and don't go through that complex execution path for write requests; but those write requests are actually the main drivers for losing the type information, manual JSON parsing etc.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, please also note that:\r\n\r\n- Spring Web MVC is (obviously) a first class citizen in the current tech stack we are using (testability...); JAX-RS on the other not so much and it's usage is (I'd argue) responsible for a big chunk of our technical debt (\"integration\" tests)\r\n- all these changes are a proposal and intentionally done in the custom module folder so that no one currently working on projects needs to be bothered, but at the same time we generate fully working (custom) Docker images that can actually be used/tested\r\n- everything that is created in this context can be (and is by default) turned off, even in the custom Docker build\r\n- the goal is not to migrate 100% of the REST layer, but to create a proof of concept to show how things could look like... of course this needs to be discussed in the community\r\n- surprisingly we seem to mimic (in general) the coding style from 1-2 decades ago (including e. g. tying the business logic to the transport protocol/format of the REST API layer)... even for new features\r\n\r\nRead reqeuests, Spring Web MVC or not, are not really that relevant here (although I would still do it and as said it's a lower entry level to tackle the issue of type safety)... the bigger questions start with the write requests and how we can improve on those.\r\n\r\nThat's why Zeyad started to map out that (write request) execution flow:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/fineract/assets/380079/1357016c-3650-4b71-8e9d-1b6f671617fe)\r\n\r\nFrom the top of my head I can remember a couple of things that popped out while investigating all this:\r\n\r\n- also not clear why we need that many command related \"wrapper\" data structures... when in all of them serialized JSON in a string variable is the common denominator for the request parameters... THE main reason for the whole type safety discussion\r\n- it's not really clear why we need 3 components/services (blue boxes) to process write requests; in most cases the blue boxes are only used in one place...\r\n- validation (aka enforcement of permissions) is done in a couple of places/services/components and is mixed with business logic which makes it very hard to reason what rules actually apply; the enforcement also happens quite \"late\", in other words: this should happen in the REST API layer as soon as possible (either with web security config and/or with Spring Security AccessDecisionVoters)\r\n- for some reason it seems that we do \"manual\" (?) transaction management somewhere in that execution pipeline (blue boxes in the diagram), don't remember exactly where that was... really not sure why we have to do this ourselves and why Spring/Data seems somehow not enough here?\r\n\r\nIf we'll actually see PoC code for improving write requests (in the custom modules... again, not in the way of any current development efforts) that is still open; documenting the current state of affairs properly would already be a great win. If we get some sort of proof of concept out of this then even better... because then we really have something that we can discuss vs. Wiki pages where ideas usually go to die (I'm exaggerating to make a point).\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2213566671/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2215676824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3918#issuecomment-2215676824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3918","id":2215676824,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ86EEIuY","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T00:16:26Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T00:16:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request seems to be stale.
