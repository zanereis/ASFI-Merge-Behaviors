Actually such as Spark Thrift Server or Kyuubi which is long running service, they only expose the SQL APIs for users, and they share one application for users' SQLs, so you can't set conf like which in code, and they can't identify what type of SQL it is.

this comes out of a test we did with one of our biggest customers, where the current object storage layout still resulted in throttling, but by extending it we were able to eliminate throttling. \r\n\r\nThere are 2 issues with the current layout, here are some data we collected internally:\r\n\r\n1. The left padding is an area of concern.  If the hex-encoded version of the hash is not always 8 characters long, then there will be a large number of entries that start with one or more “0” characters, which could create uneven heat distribution for S3.  To test this theory we use UUID to simulate file paths, generate 10M random entries, and then apply the existing algorithm.  We can plot the histogram of the length of a non-padded, hex-encoded entropy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlength[1] = 0 \r\nlength[2] = 2 \r\nlength[3] = 24 \r\nlength[4] = 281 \r\nlength[5] = 4589 \r\nlength[6] = 73243 \r\nlength[7] = 1173442 \r\nlength[8] = 8748419 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis indicates that ~12.5% of all file paths will start with “0”, which for a hex-encoded string should have been 6.25% since there are 16 characters in the set.  \r\n\r\n2. All hex-encodings start with the inclusive range 0-8:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncount(partition[\"0\"]) = 1249993 \r\ncount(partition[\"1\"]) = 1250614 \r\ncount(partition[\"2\"]) = 1250830 \r\ncount(partition[\"3\"]) = 1250695 \r\ncount(partition[\"4\"]) = 1249028 \r\ncount(partition[\"5\"]) = 1249782 \r\ncount(partition[\"6\"]) = 1249436 \r\ncount(partition[\"7\"]) = 1249622 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that the default algorithm generates values up to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which in Java is `(2^31)-1`.  When this is converted to hex, it produces 0x7FFFFFFF, so it’s understandable why the first half of the range is restricted to 8 characters using the existing algorithm.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, maybe we do not need all the character range to solve it. An alternative approach is to use something like a reverse hex, which we have also tested to be working. But this approach will maximize the entropy in any cases without the need to worry about S3 internals. I will ask S3 team to take a look and see if the proposed approach is necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474064817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474112225","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7066#issuecomment-1474112225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7066","id":1474112225,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85X3Srh","user":{"login":"dpaani","id":5696806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY4MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5696806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani","html_url":"https://github.com/dpaani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpaani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-17T16:42:30Z","updated_at":"2023-03-17T16:42:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @RussellSpitzer @jackye1995 I have addressed your review comments.

The reason is that `Iterables#retainAll` will test whether each element in `wrapperSet` exists in `toRetain` set and retain an element when `toRetain#contains` returns `true`. However, `wrapperSet` is a `Set<CharSequenceWrapper>` and what we want to retain should be a collection of `CharSequence`. In such cases `toRetain#contains` will always return `false` because their classes are different. The same happens in `removeAll`.\r\n\r\nIn the new commit, the passed in `CharSequence` objects will be converted to `CharSequenceWrapper` and then for comparison, thus fixes this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474739619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474755159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7133#issuecomment-1474755159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7133","id":1474755159,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85X5vpX","user":{"login":"zhongyujiang","id":42907416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTA3NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42907416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongyujiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongyujiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-18T07:09:13Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T07:09:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The failed task is iceberg-spark:iceberg-spark-3.2_2.12:checkstyleTest, not relevant to this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474755159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474837901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7127#issuecomment-1474837901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7127","id":1474837901,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85X6D2N","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-18T12:32:39Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T12:32:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One of the common causes of delete failure in the public cloud is hitting the API quotas and unnecessary re-runs of the delete action\n\nNot really.

If you are seeing it in your own code -why not fix it there rather than expose the failure to apps?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1474837901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1475034281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7096#issuecomment-1475034281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7096","id":1475034281,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85X6zyp","user":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-18T23:46:27Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T23:46:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" \r\n> @szehon-ho I got your point. Actually such as Spark Thrift Server or Kyuubi which is long running service, they only expose the SQL APIs for users, and they share one application for users' SQLs, so you can't set conf like which in code, and they can't identify what type of SQL it is. This change mainly covers this scenario.\r\n\r\nIn that case couldn't you set something like `sql(\"SET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1\")` before the DeleteOrphanFilesSparkAction and change it back to default once it finishes.

I dont see this flag being used extensively except necessary, to add new dimensions to cache. What would be the behavior if the cache is full?\r\n\r\nI meant the static cache in CachedClientPool. It's created as\r\n```java\r\n  private synchronized void init() {\r\n    if (clientPoolCache == null) {\r\n      clientPoolCache =\r\n          Caffeine.newBuilder()\r\n              .expireAfterAccess(evictionInterval, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)\r\n              .removalListener((ignored, value, cause) -> ((HiveClientPool) value).close())\r\n              .build();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe do have TTL on the entries which by default expire in 5min. Not sure if we also want to set a max size of the cache. E.g. suppose we add UGI to the key, and there're lots of short-lived user sessions, then the cache may hold pools that are no longer needed until they hit
