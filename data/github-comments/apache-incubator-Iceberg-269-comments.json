For context, we've been talking about how to use FileIO for things that it isn't intended.

The solution is to be able to get the client that is configured and use it for more custom operations. I think it's reasonable to make the client available like this.\r\n\r\n+1 from me, but I'll leave this open for a while so others can comment.

We've noticed that users often check if all source files have been properly loaded by examining the parquet files of the Iceberg table. However, in some cases, the table may have source files with zero rows, and these files are currently not included in the table scan.\r\n\r\nWhile excluding these empty files is a good optimization, we believe it's important to provide the option to include even empty files in the scans. This way, we can offer more flexibility and ensure thorough checks.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or suggestions about this. Your feedback is highly appreciated!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRusty","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1662561225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1662600003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8191#issuecomment-1662600003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8191","id":1662600003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85jGUND","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-02T16:59:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T17:00:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@onerishabh You can use this existing function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef datetime_to_micros(dt: datetime) -> int:\r\n    \"\"\"Converts a datetime to microseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000.\"\"\"\r\n    if dt.tzinfo:\r\n        delta = dt -

There is no `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` type in Hive.

I also checked the current Hive implementation and was able to verify the same.\r\n\r\nAnswering the questions raised - \r\n> How do we handle TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE? Do we need a specific reader for it?\r\n\r\n`IcebergTimestampWithZoneObjectInspectorHive3.java` is the reader for `TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE` since it extends `TimestampLocalTZObjectInspector` interface and there is no `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` type currently supported by Hive.\r\n\r\n> What is the behavior with respect to the session time zone of that type? What is responsible for conversion?\r\n\r\n`TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE` type is supposed to return the timestamp data in the timezone of the session. \r\nCurrently, the time zone of a session is fetched here as follows - \r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * A TimestampTZTypeInfo with system default time zone.\r\n   */\r\n  public static final TimestampLocalTZTypeInfo timestampLocalTZTypeInfo = new TimestampLocalTZTypeInfo(\r\n      ZoneId.systemDefault().getId());\r\n```\r\nSource - https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/typeinfo/TypeInfoFactory.java#L72-L73\r\n\r\nThis `timestampLocalTZTypeInfo` object is used by the constructor of `IcebergTimestampWithZoneObjectInspectorHive3.java` -\r\n```\r\n  private IcebergTimestampWithZoneObjectInspectorHive3() {\r\n    super(TypeInfoFactory.timestampLocalTZTypeInfo);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSo essentially the timezone picked is the session timezone.\r\n\r\n**This PR make use of session timezone while constructing primitive Java objects**.\r\n\r\n> What is the session time zone?\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * A TimestampTZTypeInfo with system default time zone.\r\n   */\r\n  public static final TimestampLocalTZTypeInfo timestampLocalTZTypeInfo = new TimestampLocalTZTypeInfo(\r\n      ZoneId.systemDefault().getId());\r\n```\r\nThe session time zone is the system default time zone where the cluster is running.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1665441273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1665449121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7067#issuecomment-1665449121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7067","id":1665449121,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85jRLyh","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-04T11:19:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T11:19:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with you there, but it happens after the filtering, so PyIceberg will already prune the unrelated files, and filter out the unrelated data. \r\n\r\nThe problem with `to_pyarrow_dataset` is that Iceberg has much more sophisticated pruning, that can happen at different levels, and this cannot be expressed in arrow fragments. We're looking into adding substrait integration for PyIceberg, where we could express this, but this is further along.\r\n\r\nWith [Iceberg's hidden partitioning](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/partitioning/), we don't have to do things like:\r\n```\r\n    Use the `pyarrow_options` parameter to read only certain partitions.\r\n\r\n    >>> pl.scan_delta(  # doctest: +SKIP\r\n    ...     table_path,\r\n    ...     pyarrow_options={\"partitions\": [(\"year\", \"=\", \"2021\")]},\r\n    ... )\r\n```\r\nWhich I think is very user-unfriendly, because if you don't pass the partition, it will also cause Polars to read too much data.\r\n\r\nSince `pl.LazyFrame._scan_python_function(...)` only will be called on an action, and that passes in the filter-predicate, I think we're fine.
