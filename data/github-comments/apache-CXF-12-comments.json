Jakarta EE 9.1 published in 2021 will already contain new functionality that MUST NOT be available from the `javax` namespace according to Oracle's brand licencing restrictions (which not only apply to the EF as a provider but also certainly to the AF as a consumer) which originally caused all this package renaming nonsense. But your shading solution would allow to write code in the `javax` namespace calling that new functionality hence leading to the caller being unaware whether he is in the Java EE world or in the Jakarta EE world, which is *exactly* what Oracle *and* the EF forbid! So once CXF supports this new functionality it MUST rewrite the `import`s -- or otherwise, *never* support this new functionality! Btw, that new functionality is the *sole* reason why I spend time into CXF currently! So why not doing it right from the start? With Jakarta EE 9 we explicitly agreed in the Jakarta WG to *only* do this sole change to allow all vendors to find their time for this exhausting work to *not* be forced to mix it later with the work needed for additional features. So if you defer the code changes to 9.1 you will simply have more work in less time. Hence I really doubt this decision. It would be much better to simply open a feature branch for Jakarta EE 9 and start this tedious work already. This PR can be seen as an attempt for *that*. Everything else is out of scope of *this* PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/751215473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/751215920","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/737#issuecomment-751215920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/737","id":751215920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTIxNTkyMA==","user":{"login":"mkarg","id":1701815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDE4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1701815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg","html_url":"https://github.com/mkarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-25T09:11:14Z","updated_at":"2020-12-25T09:11:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Thanks for working on it, @mkarg , we have an umbrella ticket for Jakarta EE 9.0 migration ...\r\n\r\nJust to make clear, I hope I will not be the only one working on this.

Hence GlassFish, hence Payara, will be `jakarta`-namespaced rather soon, hence their customers will do the switch **eagerly** and at the Jakarta EE marketing committee we working very hard to convince tool vendors and application authors to do it **right now** to be prepared for that very moment). The `javax` namespace is definitively **dead**, i.e.  MUST NOT get extended *in any way*. This means, if your customers stick with `javax`, they *soley* will get bug fixes, but never new features (at least on an API level). I doubt that many customers understood that so far. They MUST rewrite their applications to `javax` to use **any** new API-level features, so that's why I really plea for branching CXF into a `javax` sustained branch and a `jakarta` branch.

The Jakarta EE WG decided the big bang certainly *only for EE*, not for third parties; the intention was to get past this mixing situation ASAP, and the big vendors *agreed* to that plan, as it is the *smaller* pain. Now you pick *third parties* to proof \"nobody\" did -- after just few week! This is ridiculous, as we all are just in the migration phase. First, certainly *third party* libs are free to adopt or not adopt the new namespace as they like. Second, the Jakarta namespace is here since *few weeks* only, and certainly it needs months until third parties adopted it. But in the end, the `javax` namespace definitively *is dead* and there is no value in keeping it for long. Jersey for example eargerly switched the master branch (3.x), but everybody can run javax-namespaced legacy applications on a still maintained sustained branch (2.x) -- just what I proposed and what is totally fine for users. Nobody is *ever* allowed to extend `javax` in any way, so **eventually** every lib, and every direct implementation, like CXF, *must* either adopt the namespace, or deal with *more and more* tweaks. For example, in EE 10 there will be backwards-incompatible changes in JAX-RS, so the stack of tweaks will pile higher and higher. Anyways, I still do not see where my statements where wrong and even more, I do not understand what this discussion is all about.

Personally I think we should support the efforts of the Jakarta EE WG to shape the future of Enterprise Java and thus I'd like to see us moving forward. However maintaining an additional branch in CXF for it (with the limited number of commiters we have) is something I wouldn't prioritize at the moment (haven't seen a single user asking for it), but I

I suggest to:\r\n1. Introduce `org.apache.cxf.jaxws.handler.jakartaee` and `org.apache.cxf.jaxws.handler.javaee` packages\r\n2. Introduce `JakartaeeHandlerChainBuilder` and `JavaeeHandlerChainBuilder`\r\n3. Basically, I think it safe to assume that either JakartaEE or JavaEE namespace is going to be used, so in this case `AnnotationHandlerChainBuilder` could inspect the namespace, instantiate  `JakartaeeHandlerChainBuilder` or`JavaeeHandlerChainBuilder`, and delegate to one of those. In this case, the conditionals should be gone and implementation becomes much cleaner. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

We won't be changing the public API, which is outlined by `AnnotationHandlerChainBuilder`. The `JakartaeeHandlerChainBuilder`  and `JavaeeHandlerChainBuilder` would encapsulate the implementation specifics to each namespace, and are not supposed to be used outside `AnnotationHandlerChainBuilder`. All the existing classes, under `org.apache.cxf.jaxws.handler.types` fe, could stay were they are.
