I think you are getting to the root of the problem of the intermittent failure of the TransportCachingIT.testCachedTransport with this improvement (#1542).  The flakiness of that test is showing a problem with the function \r\n```java \r\nprivate TTransport getTransport(ThriftTransportKey cacheKey)\r\n```\r\nin my opinion.  I will make comments on that issue also.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/595347678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/595389025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1453#issuecomment-595389025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1453","id":595389025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTM4OTAyNQ==","user":{"login":"Manno15","id":29436247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDM2MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29436247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15","html_url":"https://github.com/Manno15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Manno15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-05T18:53:25Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T18:53:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner It appears that setLocation is used by several other files like MetaDataStateStore, RootTabletStateStore, and LoggingTabletStateStore.

Is this a problem with the new bulk import API?\r\n\r\nI think this can still happen in the new bulk import for 2.x as well.  The version used was 1.9 but I think this is more of an enhancement to prevent bad data from causing catastrophic failures.

I'm not sure it's adding any value being perpetually open.

I found one use case for an API for this method [here](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/datawave/blob/7e9f0c68275361cb57d5a82ddd874101c1867528/warehouse/query-core/src/main/java/datawave/mr/bulk/RecordIterator.java#L390).\r\n\r\nOne idea I had was to put this method onto the ```TableOperations``` interface.  It could look like this:\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n   * Load a stack of iterators from what is configured on the provided table and with the scope.\r\n   * The specified source will be the bottom of the stack and the top SortedKeyValueIterator on the\r\n   * stack will be returned.  The objects would be created and have their init methods called.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param tableName\r\n   *          the name of the table where the iterators are configured\r\n   * @param scope\r\n   *          the scope of the iterators\r\n   * @param source\r\n   *          the iterator at the start of the stack\r\n   * @return the SortedKeyValueIterator at the top of the stack\r\n   */\r\n  SortedKeyValueIterator<Key,Value> loadIterators(String tableName, IteratorScope scope,\r\n      SortedKeyValueIterator<Key,Value> source)\r\n      throws AccumuloException, TableNotFoundException, IOException;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be very similar to the internal method.  Loading the iterators this way can't guarantee any order that they are applied to the stack though.  Another way would be to just return a list of ```IteratorSetting``` objects but this is basically what [TableOperations.listIterators](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/client/admin/TableOperations.java#L942) currently does.\r\n\r\nWe could also just supply a convenience static method on ```IteratorUtil``` now that is part of the public API, like this:\r\n```\r\npublic static SortedKeyValueIterator<Key,Value> loadIterators(AccumuloClient client, String tableName, IteratorScope scope, SortedKeyValueIterator<Key,Value> source)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not convinced we need a public method for this behavor but I thought it should be addressed in 2.1.  We would basically be providing what is done internally [here](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/3fd5cad92f9b63ac19e4466f3f2d5237b905262c/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/conf/IterConfigUtil.java#L202).  We would need an option whether to initialize the iterators or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/598282738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/598298548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1558#issuecomment-598298548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1558","id":598298548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODI5ODU0OA==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T16:57:34Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T16:57:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii I think this is good to go if you are happy with updated the comments","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/598298548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/598354436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1555#issuecomment-598354436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1555","id":598354436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODM1NDQzNg==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T18:37:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T18:37:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged into master in commit 84d5b995302c8774c6e9024612aff7495dd73727.
