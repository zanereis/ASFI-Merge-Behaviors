Will rebase after KAFKA-2948 is committed. \n@ijuma @hachikuji In this PR (the top commit) `Metadata` keeps track of unknown topics reported in an update for which warnings have already been issued. The list is reset on an update and also when add/setTopics is called. This ensures that a client sending a message to an unknown topic sees one warning followed by a `TimeoutException` if auto-create is disabled. Another send would see the same again. For consumer assign, one log warning is generated on the assign. At the moment, `poll()` never returns, but if KAFKA-3727 is fixed to avoid the infinite loop, each assign would generate one warning. I am not sure if this is the right solution.

The main change I made is moving the offset cache of each group into `GroupMetadata`. For groups which only use offset commits, the group will stay in the `Empty` state until all offsets for the group expire. The change helps to unify expiration logic and addresses the race condition between offset commits and offset expiration, which could previously result in an inconsistent cache.

This version LGTM given the current state of semantics for the consumer and how it modifies the `assignment` immediately upon subscription changes. I think having to handle this stuff both in the expected place (on revoke) and immediately in each subscription is a bit messy, but the right solution when preserving today's semantics.\n\nI'm ready to commit this, but I think we should also consider whether those semantics should change before doing this (if we changed the semantics, some of this code would not be necessary). Here's my reasoning:\n- I can't actually think of a pattern for application development that would rely on the current behavior where the assignment is filtered immediately.\n- Current behavior seems error prone wrt resource cleanup since it isn't unreasonable for a user to expect symmetric calls to onPartitionsAssigned and onPartitionsRevoked.\n- The behavior today is inconsistent between subscriptions that are a list of topics and regex subscriptions: when you set a regex subscription, the assignment is _not_ filtered immediately after the subscription change.\n- Very few people probably rely on the intersection of functionality that would be affected: they would have to both pass in a ConsumerRebalanceListener, make subscription changes, and rely on the callback returning the filtered list.\n\nI think it might be worth doing a quick KIP and trying to clean up the semantics if nobody objects. It would be an incompatible change which isn't great, but it is a semantic change (no API compatibility issues to worry about) and as mentioned above, I think in practice it likely doesn't affect many people directly now. Kafka Connect actually _could_ be affected by this if we get some config changes (like subscription) to pass through without requiring a full rebalance. It looks like we actually happen to track the necessary info such that this isn't a problem (because of some offset info we track in its own HashMap instead of relying on the assignment in the consumer), but minor changes to the code could easily break things.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/224374091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/224376442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1363#issuecomment-224376442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1363","id":224376442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM3NjQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T18:45:43Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T18:45:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 on @ewencp's comment.

Ah, I missed that. I agree the behavior is a little surprising, but it makes sense when I think of the implementation. We currently block setting the initial position of each partition. When using subscribe(), it's not possible to be assigned a non-existing partition so this is never a problem. But obviously a manually assigned partition for a non-existent topic is a non-existing partition, and we'll block setting the position. So to fix the inconsistency, we'll have to think through the implications of removing that blocking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/224678185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/224696267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1215#issuecomment-224696267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1215","id":224696267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDY5NjI2Nw==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T19:09:38Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T19:09:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@becketqin : Thanks for updating the patch.

Adding a topic does not seem to trigger a rebalance: hmm, this is not expected and may reveal a bug in the current implementation. My understanding is that, when a new topic is created, the underlying consumer will detect these new topics from refreshed metadata and send a new JoinGroup request to the coordinator, causing rebalance.\n2. Upon a rebalance is triggered, upon `onPartitionRevoked` we will close all the tasks; and upon `onPartitionAssigned` we will create new tasks. So for both topic creation / deletion, the `StreamPartitionAssignor` should be triggered, which in turn triggers `PartitionGrouper`.

is caused by an `atLeast(0)` validation in `ProducerConfig.java` that is not present in `KafkaConfig` for the server configuration:\n\n``` java\n  .define(SEND_BUFFER_CONFIG, Type.INT, 128 * 1024, atLeast(0), Importance.MEDIUM, CommonClientConfigs.SEND_BUFFER_DOC)\n  .define(RECEIVE_BUFFER_CONFIG, Type.INT, 32 * 1024, atLeast(0), Importance.MEDIUM, CommonClientConfigs.RECEIVE_BUFFER_DOC)\n```\n\nI can create a separate PR for this but because `CommonClientConfigs.java` documentation was modified I am not sure if this feature was targeted at the server only or both the server and the clients.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/224762881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/224763665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1427#issuecomment-224763665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1427","id":224763665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDc2MzY2NQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T23:40:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T23:40:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang

After deleting a topic, I let the program continue to run for some time (30+ minutes) and the remaining topics were never re-assigned.  As for adding a new topic I did the same thing, add a topic and let the program run for a while and a new assignment never happened.  I can see the new topic in the KafkaServer logs, but the changes don't propagate over to the Streams program.  I'm thinking this could have something to do with my environment and there is a silent failure somewhere.  I'll add some detailed logging and see if I can get some more information.\n\nEDIT: Fixed  the solution was to update the `ConsumerConfig.METADATA_MAX_AGE_CONFIG` to a smaller value.
