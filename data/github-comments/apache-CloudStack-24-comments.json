RegisterSSHKeyPairCmd.getPublicKey() doesn't do a decoding of the key. That's just a simple getter method.\n2. However, I don't think the addition of the URLDecoder for the public key is really necessary.\n\nI have seen the use of URLDecoder for the cypher text, an URL or form data, but not the pub-key itself being decoded using W3C.\n\n\"\"\" Decodes a application/x-www-form-urlencoded string using a specific encoding scheme. The supplied encoding is used to determine what characters are represented by any consecutive sequences of the form \"%xy\".\n\nNote: The World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation states that UTF-8 should be used. Not doing so may introduce incompatibilities.\"\"\"\n\n@DaanHoogland, is it being done because the data is coming via the API, which is a web based? If so, it does make sense.\n\n@borisroman: in order to make Java compatible with the RFC-3986, we need to do something like:\n- To comply with RFC-3986.\n  - URLEncoder.encode(original, \"UTF-8\").replace(\"+\", \"%20\").replace(\"*\", \"%2A\").replace(\"%7E\", \"~\");\n\nPerhaps finding where the pub-key gets decoded before the the code Daan added is better than just removing it.\n\nIn addition, could you let me know which steps you followed to test it? I would like to help verifying.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/123766531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/123774877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/616#issuecomment-123774877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/616","id":123774877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzc3NDg3Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-22T16:11:27Z","updated_at":"2015-07-22T16:11:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-analysis
