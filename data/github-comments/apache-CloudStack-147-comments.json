I can see why all the out-of-band management tests may fail, these tests require that the mgmt server is able to send/receive UDP traffic from/to the management server to the server where you're running the marvin tests. In case of any iptables rules dropping UDP packets, most/all the oobm tests will fail as they launch a `ipmisim` (ipmi-simulator) server that listens on random UDP port. So these can be ignored, as they are passing both on Travis and in several other environments.\n\nThe other failures related to redundant VRs and VPC are known issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/255187101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/255188462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1703#issuecomment-255188462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1703","id":255188462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTE4ODQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T18:27:31Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T18:27:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The same results as 1692.  Overall much better state. We have still failure in execution of the following tests:\ntest_privategw_acl\ntest_routers_network_ops\ntest_vpc_redundant\ntest_vpc_router_nics\n\nAll of the failure seem to be either environmental or due to incorrect ACL order .\nAlso out-of-band management test give a lot of exceptions but this is as expected.\n\nWe had to make one change that I propose to include. In test_service_offereing.py line 389 switch from\n\nrange=20 to range=40 . In our tests variation in available RAM in CentOs was larger than 20 Mb so test_service_offereing fails.\n\nLet's merge this !!!\n\nSuccessful tests.
