I know it's how FB does it with dataswarm, but this is a really uncommon practice across a wide range of systems. If you look at virtually every other scheduler, as well as most other distributed deployment systems (mesos, YARN, Kubernetes, etc), none of them deploy code this way.\n\nI'm in a similar position to Bolke--installing a bunch of teams' packages in either the Airflow virtual environment, or the system's Python space is not easily do-able.\n\nWhat are the exact concerns? I see two, so far:\n1. The sys.path issue.\n2. The Docker vs. Zip issue.\n\n(1), I'm not well versed to comment on, so I'll leave you two to it. :) For (2), even if Docker DAG packages are supported, for those not using Docker, one could argue that supporting zip deployables might be nice. It's kind of a kitchen sink approach, though, so I'm more in favor of an either/or (I prefer to have the framework be opinionated).\n\nMaybe you could shed some light on what the Docker proposal looks like, when it might be implemented,

This creates a child process, which is then replaced by `gunicorn`, so the original `airflow scheduler` process still lives on:\n\n```\ninit(1)\n     ├─supervisord(10778)───airflow(20833)───gunicorn: maste(20838)─┬─gunicorn: worke(20852)\n     │                                                              ├─gunicorn: worke(20853)\n     │                                                              ├─gunicorn: worke(20854)\n     │                                                              └─gunicorn: worke(20859)\n```\n\nSupervisor, when terminating the webserver, kills the airflow process, leaving the gunicorn alive since airflow does no signal propagation. So the situation afterwards is an orphaned gunicorn directly attached to `init`:\n\n```\ninit(1)\n     ├─gunicorn: maste(20838)─┬─gunicorn: worke(20852)\n     │                        ├─gunicorn: worke(20853)\n     │                        ├─gunicorn: worke(20854)\n     │                        └─gunicorn: worke(20859)\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if `os.execvp` were done directly by Airflow instead of using `subprocess.popen`, the fork would not be done and the airflow process replaced by gunicorn:\n\n```\ninit(1)\n     ├─supervisord(10778)───gunicorn: maste(20838)─┬─gunicorn: worke(20852)\n     │                                             ├─gunicorn: worke(20853)\n     │                                             ├─gunicorn: worke(20854)\n     │                                             └─gunicorn: worke(20859)\n```\n\nsupervisor would then terminate the gunicorn master process (since this is the process that has replaced the airflow process that supervisor spawned), which does signal propagation to its children and everything would be properly terminated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/212488383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/212491667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1408#issuecomment-212491667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1408","id":212491667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjQ5MTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T16:05:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T16:05:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code

, thanks for considering this issue again. I'll be happy to test the PR in our setup.\nConcerning pidproxy: yes, this would work in the supervisord case, but would only solve half of our problems. We are also running Airflow on an Aurora/Mesos cluster and have the same issues there with stopping the webserver. Currently, we resort to not using the `airflow webserver` command at all and directly call `gunicorn` with the parameters that `airflow webserver` uses. So I think a solution that allows to properly terminate a non-daemonized webserver still has its use
