been working on getting this to work.  @JohnOmernik started a sqlalchemy dialect which used PyODBC to connect to Drill.  I had a lot of issues getting Drill to work via ODBC so I decided to use PyDrill which makes use of Drill's RESTFul interface and hence requires no configuration.  \r\n\r\nHowever, PyDrill is not DBAPI compliant. :-( \r\nSo... I had to write a DBAPI module for PyDrill to make that work.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge which I'm encountering is the data type issue.  What I've done is as follows:\r\n- If the field is a known function, problem solved.\r\n- Otherwise, create a secondary query which uses the `typeof()` function to determine the data type.  \r\nSo... for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT field1, field2\r\nFROM dfs.test.`data.csv`\r\n```\r\nexecutes a secondary query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT field1, typeof( field1 ) AS field1_type, field2, typeof( field2 ) AS field2_type\r\nFROM dfs.test.`data.csv`\r\n```\r\nWhile this works, there are a lot of edge cases in parsing the SQL.  You have to extract the fields which can be column names, subqueries, functions etc. and that can be complex.  Additionally, aggregate queries will break this model, so I've been trying to figure out a workaround for that.   I just found a module called `sqlparse` which I'm in the process of using to rewrite some of this code.  I believe that it will be much more reliable once I'm done with that.\r\n\r\nAll of this is actually done in the DBAPI module, not the SQLAlchemy dialect.\r\n\r\nIn any event, here is the code for the sqlalchemy dialect.   I will post the PyDrill DBAPI module to this thread shortly. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cgivre/sqlalchemy-drill/tree/pydrill\r\n\r\nUsing this code, I've gotten Superset to:\r\n\r\n- Connect to Drill\r\n- Retrieve available workspaces\r\n- Retrieve tables (files)\r\n- In SQL Lab execute arbitrary queries\r\n- Do some (but not all) visualizations in Superset\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in assisting, I'd really appreciate the help. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/274923188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/274923962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1993#issuecomment-274923962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1993","id":274923962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDkyMzk2Mg==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T20:10:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T20:10:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW... @mistercrunch I'm actually of the opinion that it probably would be better to have a dedicated connector for Drill as opposed to using SQLAlchemy.
