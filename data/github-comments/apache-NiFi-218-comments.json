One place where I can think of where we need to be careful that we're doing the right thing is `ValidateRecord` but that Processor is explicitly passing a value for the field:\r\n```\r\nwhile ((record = reader.nextRecord(coerceTypes, false)) != null) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd any case in which we infer the schema, we should have an entry for every field that is found because we infer the schema based on scanning all records in the flowfile first.\r\n\r\nSo I think it makes sense to drop unknown fields. It also is consistent with what the JavaDocs state will happen :) So I'm a +1 on that approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2442425790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2442472334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9347#issuecomment-2442472334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9347","id":2442472334,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6RlSuO","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T19:43:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T19:43:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @markap14 - will update the PR shortly","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2442472334/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2442526289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9388#issuecomment-2442526289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9388","id":2442526289,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6Rlf5R","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T20:11:07Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T20:11:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@grishick I corrected the formatting in `PGDelete` and rebased to address the one-line merge conflict.
