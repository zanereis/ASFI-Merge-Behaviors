Rebased on top of master.\r\n* Added ServiceResourceTransformer to the common shading configuration to match what was done in #2182 \r\n\r\nIf there are modules which do not need to shade and relocate Guava - for example if they actively need to not do this and/or we feel that their file size has inflated without any reason - we can add the following <plugin> node to their `<build><plugins>` to \"opt-out\" of the default shading configuration:\r\n```xml\r\n<plugin>\r\n  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>\r\n  <executions>\r\n    <execution>\r\n      <id>bundle-and-repackage</id>\r\n      <phase>none</phase>\r\n    </execution>\r\n  </executions>\r\n</plugin>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother way to tackle large file sizes would be to configure minimization by default.\r\n\r\nI think we should start a minimization track separately from this change, as there are some issues with it:\r\n1. There is a bug in shade-plugin where if minimization is declared on a project with pom packaging it fails. I have created a [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSHADE-253) and [PR](https://github.com/apache/maven-plugins/pull/107) with a fix for this but could take a while before it is available to us.\r\n2. Minimization on all of our modules adds a significant amount of build time, which, as discussed, we wish to avoid. (Up from 02:30 mins for a build skipping tests on my laptop to over 5 mins)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/286393622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/286400495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2193#issuecomment-286400495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2193","id":286400495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjQwMDQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-14T12:00:31Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T12:00:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/8381/<h2>Build result: FAILURE</span></h2>[...truncated 801.12 KB...]\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:62)\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)\tat java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:423)\tat org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.CachedConstructor.invoke(CachedConstructor.java:83)\tat org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.CachedConstructor.doConstructorInvoke(CachedConstructor.java:77)\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.ConstructorSite$ConstructorSiteNoUnwrap.callConstructor(ConstructorSite.java:84)\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSiteArray.defaultCallConstructor(CallSiteArray.java:60)\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.AbstractCallSite.callConstructor(AbstractCallSite.java:235)\tat org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.AbstractCallSite.callConstructor(AbstractCallSite.java:247)\tat org.codehaus.mojo.findbugs.FindbugsViolationCheckMojo.execute(FindbugsViolationCheckMojo.groovy:529)\tat org.apache.maven.plugin.DefaultBuildPluginManager.executeMojo(DefaultBuildPluginManager.java:134)\tat org.apache.maven.lifecycle.internal.MojoExecutor.execute(MojoExecutor.java:208)\t... 31 more2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] 2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] 2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] 2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command2017-03-14T12:00:18.245 [ERROR]   mvn <goals> -rf :beam-sdks-java-io-hadoop-input-format-hifiochannel stoppedSetting status of 613f7ba50d61435c80d32cdcf04bbb0fa893a648 to FAILURE with url https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/8381/ and message: 'Build finished.

I believe there are two issues. 1) `virtualenv` is not installed by default. This is not a jenkins specific problem, this is the for a basic python installation. 2) `tox` manages a virtualenv, running `tox` inside the virtualenv does not make such sense, but we can switch to it. I am not sure it works correctly or not though (i.e. virtualenv in virtualenv). Even if we address 2), because of 1) we will continue to install user packages.\r\n\r\nIf we take a step, the instructions for running the maven script does not require setting up a `virtualenv`. It will create one as part of the process and use it. If you think that user installed packages are an issue, we can remove them at the clean phase maybe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/286494000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/286496147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2196#issuecomment-286496147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2196","id":286496147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjQ5NjE0Nw==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-14T17:23:20Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T17:23:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
