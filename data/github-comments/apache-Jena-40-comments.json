It's sufficient for now as I am just currently studying ORCIDs API for the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1561886244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1562406230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1279#issuecomment-1562406230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1279","id":1562406230,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5dIG1W","user":{"login":"arne-bdt","id":53625519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53625519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt","html_url":"https://github.com/arne-bdt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-25T07:20:50Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T07:21:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's a straightforward way to improve the speed of `GraphMem` for `Graph#add` by nearly 50% and `Graph#delete` by 10-35%.

It might also be quite simple to have two variants of the graph store. That way, users can choose between the fast variant or the low memory one.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which:\r\nThere are two fields tracking changes for potential concurrent modifications:\r\n1. `org.apache.jena.mem.ArrayBunch#changes`\r\n2. `org.apache.jena.mem.HashCommon#changes`\r\n\r\nThe one in `ArrayBunch` is volatile, but the one in `HashCommon` is not. `ArrayBunch` is totally fine with integer overflow, since it checks for equality when verifying: \r\n`if (changes != initialChanges) throw new ConcurrentModificationException();`\r\n\r\nHashCommon, however, wouldn't handle an integer overflow correctly: \r\n`if (changes > initialChanges) throw new ConcurrentModificationException();`\r\n\r\nThe document header of `java.util.HashMap` states:\r\n` * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\r\n * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\r\n * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\r\n * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.\r\n * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this\r\n * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators\r\n * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>`\r\n\r\nTracking the changes here might be the safest possible way. However, `HashCommon` should then also make `changes` volatile and compare for equality rather than using a greater than comparison.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we removed both fields and checked `org.apache.jena.mem.HashCommon#size` and `org.apache.jena.mem.ArrayBunch#size` instead, we would save memory (since there are many instances of both classes) and avoid incrementing a second variable on `#add` and `#remove` operations. The iterators should still help detect concurrent modifications in almost any scenario. Only if there are an equal number of `#add` and `#remove` calls, so that the total size of the graph is not affected, could there be undetected concurrent modifications while executing an iterator. This seems unlikely enough to me that it would prevent anyone from detecting a concurrency bug.\r\nWhat is your opinion in this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1566270071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1567161037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1882#issuecomment-1567161037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1882","id":1567161037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5daPrN","user":{"login":"ZookieSwag","id":35275686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mjc1Njg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35275686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag","html_url":"https://github.com/ZookieSwag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZookieSwag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-29T13:48:01Z","updated_at":"2023-05-29T13:50:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @afs, currently the parser deletes multiple spaces in a row and new lines.

think you are right.\r\n\r\nIt's just that I found that some iterators and streams were slower than my last PR for GraphMem iterators.\r\nSometimes I might be chasing phantoms. But there were other benchmarks with consistent behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to get to the bottom of it:\r\n- in my first attempt, I only used the SparseArraySpliterator. Now it seems worth splitting it into SparseArraySpliterator and SparseArraySubSpliterator, as I did with GraphMem. The same goes for ArraySpliterator.\r\n- the NestedIterator was a lame implementation. I replaced it with IteratorOfJenaSets.\r\n- for RoaringBitmapIterator, using BufferedIterator was a good choice for #hasNext and #next, but not for #forEachRemaining.\r\n   So I changed the implementation. (It also had a bug).\r\n\r\nSome results in my benchmarks remain unclear to me:\r\n- TestGraphContainsTriple for concrete triples on GraphMem2Fast shows faster performance than GraphMem for most graphs, but for some graphs (e.g. EQ and BSBM 5) the benchmarks consistently show lower performance.\r\n- TestGraphFindAllWithForEachRemaining on GraphMem2Legacy proves faster than GraphMem for smaller graphs, but for larger graphs the benchmarks consistently show GraphMem2Legacy to be slightly slower. Given the same internal structure, I would not expect this. It could be an issue with the benchmarks, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nApart from these points, I haven't found anything in the latest JMH benchmarks to worry me.\r\n\r\nI have attached some of the latest JMH benchmarks for the different use cases.
