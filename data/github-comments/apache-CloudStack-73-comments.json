I thinks you don't use the Transifex website to update the translations?\n\nFor example on Transifex (for 4.6/4.7 resources) the Japanese translation for the key label.ha.enabled (HA Enable in US string) is: \n高可用性有効\n(translate in Google Translator: Enable high availability)\n\nBut in your PR the same key is translated with:\n高可用性を有効にする\n(translate in Google Translator: We want to enable high availability)\n\n(curiously the current japanese string on transifex seems better than your update string...)\n\nThe issue is that the transifex Japanese / Chinese resources files aren't up-to-date, so next time, when we update the resources files from transifex to the git repo, we lost all your updated strings.\n\nThe right way to translate the Web UI of CloudStack is to use the Transifex project [1] and use the script inside the cloudstack project to download and prepare the resources files (unicode/native conversion and alphabetical order) [2]\n\nTo deal with this issue, you can update the transifex JA and CH resources files with the Transifex client.

I agree with all of them, except the systemvm template. There is no reason to bump that version because there is no change yet. As soon as we introduce a change that is not compatible with 4.6.0 template, we should bump the version. Until that happens, I'd like to be able to have 4.7.0 to use the same template as 4.6.0.\n\nIn the future we should get a separate systemvm version numbering schema (separate repo even?), to break with the \"new cloudstack version == new systemvm version\". Upgrades are much easier / less impacting if one does not need to recreate all sytemvms (1000+ in our case). Especially when we're releasing more often.\n\nPinging @DaanHoogland @bhaisaab to see what they think and if I maybe forget something? Can we keep the version of systemvms at 4.6.0 until something changes? If not, can we make it work?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/158776432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/158777294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1103#issuecomment-158777294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1103","id":158777294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODc3NzI5NA==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-22T16:46:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T16:46:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pdion891 See comments on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9077 for possible solution for `/dev/loop0` issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/158777294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/158779047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1103#issuecomment-158779047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1103","id":158779047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODc3OTA0Nw==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-22T17:15:19Z","updated_at":"2015-11-22T17:15:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@remibergsma you are right, we don't need to up the sysvm template version yet.
