The current implementation does not support returning user information, so it appears limited to just the `Group` aspect of the `UserGroupProvider` interface. Although it could be combined together with the existing `AzureGraphUserGroupProvider`, that is a key configuration factor that may not be immediately obvious.\r\n\r\nThe existing `AzureGraphUserGroupProvider` covers both users and groups, and although this provider could be helpful in some scenarios, I'm not sure if it is common enough to warrant including as a standard component. It might make more sense to publish it separately to Maven Central and see if it gains interest among community users.

However, `nifi-toolkit-encrypt-config` had an implicit expectation of behavior based on the Woodstox dependency. Woodstox provides optimal processing as compared to the standard JRE version, and it is still included in the Toolkit assembly. I pushed a commit adding a direct dependency on Woodstox to `nifi-toolkit-encrypt-config`, making the expectations clear.

I've pushed a couple new commits that should address the concerns raised (except for the few that I responded to directly). Or I created Jiras to address them. For example, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11448 to speed up the adding of a Python Processor to the canvas and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11446 for better handling of the case when a Python process dies.\r\n\r\nAs for the dependency management - I am ok with a follow-on activity that allows inclusion of a `requirements.txt` but I definitely don't think we should eliminate the ability to define the requirements within the Processor itself. This is actually not an unheard-of practice. I actually implemented it that way based on what Apache Airflow allows for: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/operator/python.html - this is an example of using their @task.virtualenv decorator:\r\n```\r\n    @task.virtualenv(\r\n        task_id=\"virtualenv_python\", requirements=[\"colorama==0.4.0\"], system_site_packages=False\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nI think this makes great sense. While in some cases a `requirements.txt` could perhaps be more appropriate, providing this inline makes great sense for a large number of use cases. For example, for a user who develops a custom Processor. If they want to share that Processor with others in their organization, they should able to just send their python file. It should not require some external requirements.txt file - doing so means they'd have to zip up a directory. And then the person receiving it would have to unzip the file, would have to know where to unzip it, what directories are included in the zip, etc. It's very doable but makes everything far more complicated.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think the newest commits and noted Jiras cover all of your feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1507012164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1507145124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7171#issuecomment-1507145124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7171","id":1507145124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Z1TWk","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-13T15:10:42Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T15:10:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for getting this started @MikeThomsen.

So we'd either be serialising all errors into a single attribute that could be huge (and probably break attribute value limits) or adding an attribute for every single record, which would cause memory issues in NiFi. An alternative would be to produce a single `errors` FlowFile for every errored Record from the input FlowFile, which again would cause performance problems in NiFi if you're trying to process large amounts of Records (which is the big benefit of Record-based processors, e.g. millions of records within a single file).\r\n\r\nA flow I've used before for handling things like errors from a record processor such as `PutElasticsearchRecord` is to send the `errors` to ` PutDistributedMapCache` keyed on the document `_id` (which is in the error response from Elasticsearch) and then using the `FetchDistributedMapCache` or `LookupAttribute` to enrich each of the records in the `PutElasticsearchRecord` output in the cases where there's an `_id` match - it's a bit fidly and could require splitting FlowFiles by Record (which again brings us back to the performance hit mentioned above).\r\n\r\n*Notes*:\r\n- `PutElasticsearchHttp` (and `PutElasticsearchHttpRecord`) are _deprecated_ is recent 1.x versions of NiFi and will be *removed* in NiFi 2.x\r\n- the `elasticsearch.put.error` attribute for both `PutElasticsearchJson` and `PutElasticsearchRecord` are used for general Elasticsearch connection error reporting, e.g. if the Elasticsearch instance/cluster cis not found or authentication/authorisation fails, etc., and FlowFile processing, e.g. if the content of the FlowFile sent to `PutElastichsearchJson` can't be parsed as a JSON object","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1514554132/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1514887672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7161#issuecomment-1514887672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7161","id":1514887672,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5aS1n4","user":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-19T14:56:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T14:57:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mark-bathori I tested the change and I still get an error.

Yes that makes a lot of sense and after reading the code I see that the processor makes every effort to just pass the documents to the various relationships.  So with that in mind I propose that we make these processors behave like the RouteOnAttribute processor where the developer can define additional relationships based on expected error types.  So that the processor can simply compare the error type for each item in the collection and route to the various relationships.\r\n\r\nFor example, I might define the following:\r\n\r\nconflict -> version_conflict_engine_exception\r\nschema -> mapper_parsing_exception\r\nblocked -> cluster_block_exception\r\n\r\nThen the following relationships could be routed in the flow: success, error, retry, failure, conflict, schema, blocked.\r\n\r\nThe result would be that errors that match the 3 types are routed to 3 custom routes.  The remaining errors and other error routes would operate as they do now.\r\n\r\nThe only flaw I can think of here is that there is no definitive list of error types according to the following post, and so it takes quite a bit of sleuthing to find the possible errors and they are likely subject to change since there is no list.\r\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/bulk-api-item-error-types/242639\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1517863606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1517903668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6903#issuecomment-1517903668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6903","id":1517903668,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5aeV80","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-21T14:16:19Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T14:16:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@davis-anthony that would definitely warrant a new Jira ticket to make such a change I think.\r\n\r\nSome sort of \"half-way house\" approach may be more appropriate, e.g. like PartitionRecord where `errors` Records are grouped together into a FlowFile coming from `PutElasticsearchRecord` based upon the `type` of `error` indicated by the Elasticsearch response, with the type added to the FlowFile as the `elasticsearch.bulk.error` attribute, something like that might be helpful and hopefully avoid splitting FlowFiles up too much.
