Fixed the error codes you mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and merge the old cocoa generator in and put it behind a flag.  Ideally, users leveraging existing Swift 2.x Cocoa bindings are using Cocoapods, and have a lock to the specific commit they're using.  This isn't always the case, but should serve at least a basic level of protection on their client/library dependency side.  From the Generator's perspective, it will be completely broken unless they checkout the most recent commit before I merge them (or change any build steps to use the new generator). \r\nIn terms of their existing code if they're extending the library or inheriting from it, some of it may break given some of the interfaces have changed towards Value-typed interfaces.  Extensions should for the most part operate properly so long as they're not calling changed interfaces.   All of this is of course purely speculative as I've not gone through the process of trying to migrate.   Long story short however there should be facilities to hit old lib/generator when needed and given Swift is compiled, migrating code over shouldn't introduce any breaking changes or unexpected behaviors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/268597826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/268861679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1088#issuecomment-268861679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1088","id":268861679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODg2MTY3OQ==","user":{"login":"Jens-G","id":5834733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Jens-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-22T18:33:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T18:58:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vgotra: I'm about to clean up the patch.

This means that if the user doesn't specify them in the IDL const declaration then `rustc` will fail.\r\n2.

Assuming you meant sets, the docs say:\r\n\r\n> An unordered set of unique elements. Translates to an STL set, Java HashSet, set in Python, etc. Note: PHP does not support sets, so it is treated similar to a List\r\n\r\nSimilar to PHP, Go does not have a native type for sets, so the best thing to do is to treat it similar to a list.\r\n\r\n> Given that, I would say it could be one option to error, when the user inserts a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThis is not possible, because the caller doesn't \"insert\" anything, they simply return a slice. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n```thrift\r\nservice Foo {\r\n    set<string> bar() throws (1: Something error)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis generates an interface called `Foo` with the following method:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Foo interface {\r\n    Bar() ([]string, error)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the user simply returns a string slice, the Thrift library has no control over it. Once `Bar` returns, it's too late for Thrift itself to return an error, only panic. Speaking of which, panicking in case of ***programmer error*** is very common and idiomatic in Go. The standard library is full of such panics (e.g search for \"misuse\" [here](https://golang.org/src/sync/waitgroup.go)). I would consider returning a non-unique slice for a Thrift set a programming error (and hence deserving a panic), but if you disagree, I can update the PR with deduplication in the library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/272701441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/272706257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1088#issuecomment-272706257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1088","id":272706257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjcwNjI1Nw==","user":{"login":"vgotra","id":896830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NjgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/896830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra","html_url":"https://github.com/vgotra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgotra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-15T16:33:06Z","updated_at":"2017-01-15T16:33:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes - I can.

After I read the word \"map\" above I must have been mentally switched to maps somehow.  My mistake.\r\n\r\nNevertheless what I said about panic and errors in general above still holds true. At this time we have exactly 0 (zero) panics in the code under /lib/go/thrift.

The standard library is full of such panics \r\n\r\nPut four Go experts together and you get five opinions, all idiomatic. Especially about the high and lofty Go error handling design principles:\r\n\r\n> In Go, error handling is important. **The language's design and conventions encourage you to explicitly check for errors** where they occur (as distinct from the convention in other languages of throwing exceptions and sometimes catching them). \r\n\r\nOr mostly assigning them to `_` as many people do in Go. That's for the \"encourage you to explicitly check for errors\" part. In contrast, an exception must be caught, not only \"sometimes\", because there is no other error handling option. \r\n\r\n> The decision to not include exceptions in Go is an example of its **simplicity** and orthogonality. Using multiple return values and a simple convention, **Go solves the problem** of letting programmers know when things have gone wrong and **reserves panic for the truly exceptional**.\r\n\r\nI can't see any \"simplicity\" in replacing exceptions by panics, \"encouraging\" error handling by leading people into misusing the `_` operator and at the same time claiming \"*this time, we get it right*\".
