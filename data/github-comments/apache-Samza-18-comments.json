Would be good if we can rely on explicit signal instead of null being the signal for uncaught exception.\r\n>By having an explicit signal, you can enforce the invariant on flush not getting invoked only in the case of unhandled exception but not in other scenarios where the field got nulled.\r\n\r\nCurrentBlobWriterComponents is null when the writer is created and remains null until the first message is successfully (correct schema, encoding .. ) written. After the first message CurrentBlobWriterComponents is non null. \r\nHowever, if first message write failed then this is null and an explicit signal (if added) will also be false. Thus i feel an explicit signal will be equivalent to this null check. \r\nAdded a isClosed check along with null check as writer.flush should not be called after writer.close. This does NOT cause scenario for the current NPE.. just securing and adhering to the writer interface expectations.\r\n\r\n>3. Can we have a unit test for this scenario?\r\n\r\nadded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/775556866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/777144486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1363#issuecomment-777144486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1363","id":777144486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzE0NDQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"rmatharu-zz","id":40646191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjQ2MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40646191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/rmatharu-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmatharu-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-11T01:05:24Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T01:05:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like there is a conflict? that needs to be resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/777144486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/778478778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1464#issuecomment-778478778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1464","id":778478778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODQ3ODc3OA==","user":{"login":"perkss","id":24793711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzkzNzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24793711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss","html_url":"https://github.com/perkss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perkss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-12T22:01:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T19:15:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mynameborat @nickpan47 @xinyuiscool @sborya do you think you could take a long at some point please?

am not sure if the approach taken in the PR is the ideal way to go about achieving the changes you need. I see few problems with delegating `null` checks from `BaseKeyValueStorageEngineFactory` to the extenders. \r\n\r\n1. In `BaseKeyValueStorageEngineFactory`, we do multiple layers of wrapping stores (logged store, access logged store, serialized store) and so on.. By removing the checks, you are breaking this invariant of non-null `Serde` to all of steps that follow construction of the higher layer store (RocksDb or InMemory etc).\r\n2. Particularly, this is problematic for the construction of `SerializedKeyValueStore` and `AccessLoggedStore` because the former assumes both `KeySerde` and `ValueSerde` to be null and the latter assumes `KeySerde` to be non-null.\r\n3. Forces high layer `StorageEngineFactory` to handle `KeySerde` and `ValueSerde` during construction even though it is not necessary. For e.g. `RocksDbKeyValueStorageEngineFactory` and `InMemoryKeyValueStorageEngineFactory`\r\n4. Introduces potential problems with `Serde`; i.e. Higher layer storage engines mistakenly use the `Serde` themselves and also have wrapped store handles which potentially does `Serde` as well. \r\n\r\nIt will be good if you can take into consideration the following as part of your approach\r\n\r\n- Do storage engines mandate over what kind of wrapping is allowed? e.g. logged store and/or serialized store etc\r\n- Do end users continue to describe properties of store that indirectly determines the wrapping applied? e.g. large message enabled store (vs cached store vs access logged store\r\n- Does the framework determine the combination of configurations that drive the wrapping strategy?\r\n\r\nPotential solutions I can think of\r\n1. Introduce internal flag or have explicit store properties that drives how wrapping is accomplished and determines if a store is `SerializedKeyValueStore` or not\r\n2. Instead of removing the null check, push it down within `BaseKeyValueStorageEngineFactory` and modify how wrapping is accomplished either based on storage engines.\r\n3. If flexibility is the key, introduce capability for storage engines to implement that handles raw store without any these goodies and wrapping so it has all the control it needs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/799476540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/801437361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1471#issuecomment-801437361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1471","id":801437361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTQzNzM2MQ==","user":{"login":"Sanil15","id":16806974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODA2OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16806974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15","html_url":"https://github.com/Sanil15","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanil15/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T20:56:32Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T20:56:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

As in, AMContainerResourceRequest will always remain null within ApplicationSubmissionContext while in ClientHelper. \r\n\r\n**NPE Reason:** Peeking into yarn code shows that AMContainerResourceRequest is created, if null within [RMAppManager.validateAndCreateResourceRequest](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-2.7.1/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/RMAppManager.java#L372) by using the mem,cpu set in the ApplicationSubmissionContext.setResource. \r\n\r\n**YARN code into samza?**: The only way to set node label only for AM during submit application is to use [setAMContainerResourceRequest.setNodeLabelExpression in ApplicationSubmissionContext](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/NodeLabel.html). However, creating AMContianerResourceRequest within samza's ClientHelper will require AM_CONTAINER_PRIORITY constant which is a part of yarn-server package NOT api, common or client which samza uses. Pulling yarn-server package into samza is seems plain WRONG! Additionally, it also means in some sense replicating what RMAppManager.validateAndCreateResourceRequest does to create the AMContainerRequest.\r\n\r\n**Workaround (tested and works)** - is  in the samza-job, use yarn.am.container.label=desired-label AND yarn.container.label=\"\" -- relying on this javadoc in yarn for[ SubmissionApplicationContext](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-2.7.1/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/ApplicationSubmissionContext.java#L437) and this comment from [YARN-2493](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2493?focusedCommentId=14125163&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-14125163). This workaround places AM on desired-label node while containers go to general nodes without a label.

If we only have the option to dynamically allocate ports, then there is an ordering dependency for resource management between the job coordinator and the worker containers, because the worker containers need to know the port that the job coordinator is using. This configuration does need to be used with care, because it does introduce another failure case (i.e. port conflict) if it is not used properly.\r\n\r\nIf we dynamically allocate the port, then the job coordinator needs to expose the port first before the \"Service\" can be created. This creates more of an ordering dependency. The job coordinator would need to trigger the creation of the \"Service\" or the job coordinator needs to pass the port to somewhere (e.g. coordinator stream, config map) before something else can create the \"Service\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/832298098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/833224543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1489#issuecomment-833224543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1489","id":833224543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzIyNDU0Mw==","user":{"login":"mynameborat","id":46942335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTQyMzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46942335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat","html_url":"https://github.com/mynameborat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T04:58:35Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T04:58:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dxichen We want to merge this with master branch right?
