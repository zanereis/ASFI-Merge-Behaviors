Can you share what the `qualified name` attributes of those two `nifi_flow_path` entities? I guess those have different qualified name and probably each created by 'simple path' and 'complete path' if you run the same flow with both strategies.\r\n\r\nFor the comment of not seeing any lineage with 'simple_path', Atlas does not draw lineage if you choose an entity which is subclass of 'Process'. When you selected the 'nifi_flow_path' entity, didn't its input/output attribute have link to the `fs_path` entities? If you follow the link, then lineage will be shown from the `fs_path` entity, which is a subclass of 'DataSet'.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if above descriptions address your issues.

What I was wondering about is why HBase requires a 'Visibility Label Expression' instead of a comma separated visibility label list for delete operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the theme more, I installed and played with Accumulo, too. It turned out Accumulo and HBase both require 'Visibility Label Expression' for delete.\r\n@joshelser Would you please educate me why delete operation uses expression instead of a comma separated labels as scan does? E.g. to delete a cell having `(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach`, I had to specify exactly the same expression. I expected executing a delete request by a user having all of authorizations would delete the cell, or the logical expression would match if `spinach` was specified. But it didn't behave like that, a matching expression was needed.\r\n\r\nFollowing results are what I got executing delete operations based on the [Accumulo example](https://accumulo.apache.org/1.7/examples/visibility):\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Insert test data\r\nusername@instance vistest> insert row f1 q1 v1 -l A\r\nusername@instance vistest> insert row f2 q2 v2 -l A&B\r\nusername@instance vistest> insert row f3 q3 v3 -l (apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach\r\n\r\n# It seems users authorizations are not used for delete, and need to be specified explicitly\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f1 q1\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f1:q1 [A]    v1\r\nrow f2:q2 [A&B]    v2\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f1 q1 -l A\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f2:q2 [A&B]    v2\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\n# Specifying wrong label does not return error\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f3 q3 -l spina\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\n# The visibility label expression should match exactly\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f3 q3 -l spinach\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f3 q3 -l spinach|broccoli\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f3 q3 -l spinach|broccoli|(apple&carrot)\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f3 q3 -l (apple&carrot)|broccoli\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\nrow f3:q3 [(apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach]    v3\r\n\r\nusername@instance vistest> delete row f3 q3 -l (apple&carrot)|broccoli|spinach\r\nusername@instance vistest> scan\r\n# There are no rows\r\nusername@instance vistest>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/384408674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/384410017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2623#issuecomment-384410017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2623","id":384410017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDQxMDAxNw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T19:41:45Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T19:41:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@GreenCee thanks for submitting the JIRA, and the PR!

Consider credit-card information:\r\n```\r\njosh-creditcard1 f:number [private] -> 123456-1234-12345678\r\njosh-creditcard1 f:number [seller]   -> xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx5678\r\n```\r\nThe visibility label for Accumulo is an expression that defines if a user with a collection of visibility labels is allowed to see that record. The expression also contributes to the uniqueness of that key, almost acting as a kind of \"attribute\" for the record being store.\r\nRequiring the exact visibility label to delete the record is also important in a multi-tenant system with various levels of visibility because you may not know if other copies of the Key exist that you are unaware of. For example, if a \"seller\" was trying to delete my creditcard1 information, they would be unaware that my full creditcard number also exists there -- if we gave acknowledgment that it was deleted, that would be an information leak.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/384410901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/384416147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2518#issuecomment-384416147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2518","id":384416147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDQxNjE0Nw==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T20:03:28Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T20:03:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@joshelser Thanks for your prompt answer.

Things seem to be running as suggested, however, I'm wondering if it makes sense to improve it a little and in the process reduce the complexity of some of that code. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm referring to when we show the Execution drop down. I just stood up a standalone instance. I dropped on two processors. One that had `@PrimaryNodeOnly` and one that did not. For the processor that was marked `@PrimaryNodeOnly` we showed the Execution drop down because it's configured value was `Primary node`. This verifies the existing behavior but is a little weird because previously the only way to get into this state was by having this node be part of a cluster. Now with this PR, it is the default value even in a standalone case. The other processor which was not marked with `@PrimaryNodeOnly` we did not show the Execution drop down. I think this distinction may be confusing to users since the context of this node previously being part of a cluster is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get your thoughts on taking a slightly different approach. What if we always showed the Execution drop down and `Primary node` was always an allowed option. We could either remove or disable the `All` option conditionally based on the presence of the `@PrimaryNodeOnly` annotation. This would allow us to remove the really confusing conditionals that drive the visibility of the Execution field.\r\n\r\nIf we opted for this approach, we should probably update the tooltip/info icon for this field to indicate that when clustered, this drives which node(s) the processor will be scheduled on. The other benefit to this approach is that it will allow for users to build a flow on a standalone instance (including the appropriate execution nodes) before saving it to the Registry where the flow may be imported into a cluster.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385492377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385493400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2509#issuecomment-385493400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2509","id":385493400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTQ5MzQwMA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T18:51:08Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T18:51:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zenfenan I think there's also one other detail that I missed. The intent here, I believe, is not just to default to Primary Node execution mode when the @PrimaryNodeOnly annotation is present, but to actually enforce that the processor always use Primary Node execution mode if it has the annotation. Is that correct? If so, then I think we need to update the setExecutionMode() method to  ignore the provided value and use ExecutionMode.PRIMARY_NODE if the annotation is present. Otherwise, there is no enforcement guaranteed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385493400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385538033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2667#issuecomment-385538033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2667","id":385538033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTUzODAzMw==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T21:43:48Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T21:43:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149, @markap14, would you please review this PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385538033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385611979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2509#issuecomment-385611979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2509","id":385611979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTYxMTk3OQ==","user":{"login":"zenfenan","id":23693101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjkzMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23693101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan","html_url":"https://github.com/zenfenan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T06:56:35Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T06:56:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman I understand the points you have made. They are valid. In particular, I like the last one which is how this might have benefit in building a flow in a standalone node with appropriate nodes and then save it to the registry.\r\n\r\nI just have three questions:\r\n- `All Nodes` option should be disabled if the component is marked as `PrimaryNodeOnly`. That should be the case in both standalone as well as cluster scenario. Correct?\r\n- Processors which were previously added to the canvas i.e. those who were not `executionNodeRestricted` and had `executionNode` as `ALL` but after this change, those processors will have the `All Nodes` option disabled and the user will only have the ability to switch to `Primary Node`, post which the user will never be able to select `All Nodes` again. Technically that's correct since the processor is supposed to be run only on the primary node. You feel that is okay? Do you see any inconsistency in UX?\r\n- One more thing is, in general, I used to feel that `Execution Nodes` doesn't make sense in a standalone context so showing the dropdown still has got me thinking whether we should display it or not. But your point on showing the dropdown for all the components and in all cases (standalone or cluster) seems to make it consistent and also the understanding on how this will be well suited in actual enterprise scenarios where most enterprise customers probably use standalone node to get the flow/template ready and save it to registry and will actually import it to a cluster. The question, here, again is with respect to the UX. With this change, we will be showing the dropdown all the time for all the processors in standalone case. Do you see any issues/inconsistency with the way the user would perceive this new change?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385611979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/385613530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2509#issuecomment-385613530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2509","id":385613530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTYxMzUzMA==","user":{"login":"zenfenan","id":23693101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjkzMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23693101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan","html_url":"https://github.com/zenfenan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zenfenan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T07:09:24Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T07:09:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 I thought about it actually but since `setExecutionNode` gets called from `FlowController`/`StandardProcessorGroup` but regardless of from where it gets called they all pass the value from the `ProcessorConfigDTO` to `setExecutionNode` and since this change takes care of setting the value of `executionNode` to `PRIMARY` in the DTO, I thought it will be okay.

Sorry for the different suggestions earlier but I think we're ultimately getting it right here...\r\n\r\n- `All nodes` should be disabled if the component is marked `PrimaryNodeOnly` regardless of clustered or standalone. However, I think we should update the tooltip for this field to indicate that it's applicable when clustered. When not clustered, `All nodes` and `Primary Node` are effectively the same thing.\r\n- If a processor has been updated to `PrimaryNodeOnly` and its configuration was previously `All nodes` it should retain that value initially. However, given the first bullet above, that option will be disabled and would only allow the user to update it to `Primary node` going forward.\r\n- The field should be always visible regardless of clustered or standalone. It will allow folks to build flows which may be deployed in a cluster in the future. It also allows us to remove some of that unnecessarily complex code when determining the appropriate visibility.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/386107911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/386243292","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2616#issuecomment-386243292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2616","id":386243292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjI0MzI5Mg==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T09:47:53Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T09:47:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149

We have quite a few good implementations such as ones for HBase, ElasticSearch and MongoDB that you can use/steal from to make it happen. Would **strongly** recommend you do that because it'll make bulk ingestion of very large data sets go much faster for MarkLogic.
