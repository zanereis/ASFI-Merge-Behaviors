Concerning your code snippet suggestion, I agree with most of it. We can definitely keep a lot of the state in the MessageId object. I agree it is indeed the ideal solution. I considered it initially but was concerned of how expensive it would be to keep all of that state in the MessageId.\n\nHowever, I don't think that Using the markAsDone(id) strategy will suffice to address the cases where tuples get acked out of order, and the cases were a sequence of tuples will get acked in sequence, but shifted from the last offset committed. In this scenario we need to have a way to keep track of the offset sequences that are ready to be committed. I still think that keeping `acked Map<TopicPartition, OffsetEntry>` will take care of this in an efficient way. If there is a better way, of course, I would totally welcome a suggestion.

I can't call isRoundtrip in clojure even if I set isRoundtrip `public static`, as `SerializationTest` is a Test Class.  If I leave the origin `is-roundtrip` `serialize` `deserialize` functions in clojure, there will be a duplication of code, which is very odd.</p>\n\n<p>    So I still translate `test-clojure-serialization` to java and add a TODO comment on it . When we move to java completely , we can remove this test function entirly.</p>\n\n<p>    If you have any ideas, please let me know.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612647893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/189086484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1082#issuecomment-189086484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1082","id":189086484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTA4NjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T02:48:34Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T02:48:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptgoetz @revans2 \nCould you please take a look?
