High level question: Since the gap-fill is always processed on the broker side, will it be simpler if we always rewrite the query on the broker side to trim off the gap-fill part, so that no change is required on the server side? Another benefit of this approach is that this can eliminate the overhead of parsing sub-queries and processing gap-fill again on the servers.\r\n\r\nIf the gap-fill part is trimmed off, it is hard to tell if this is gapfill query in case of Gapfill Type query. We do not parse the sub-queries and processing gap-fill again on servers.

For segments in RT table, they should be removed based on table retention. For segments in OFFLINE table, in addition to table retention, they also should be removed based on segment lineage. As you may have noticed in the design doc, segment lineage is used by MergeRollup task for atomic segment swap.\r\n> \r\n> So, did you see any logs from [this manageSegmentLineageCleanupForTable method](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-controller/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/controller/helix/core/retention/RetentionManager.java#L196) and [this manageRetentionForTable method](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-controller/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/controller/helix/core/retention/RetentionManager.java#L100) at the controller side? to see if deletion kicked in or not.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot. I see my logs, it was because my MergeRollupTask's mergeType for offline table is `rollup`. So table retention and segment lineage are not worked. Is there any way to delete old segments for rollup offline tables?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1054960449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1055048367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8258#issuecomment-1055048367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8258","id":1055048367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c4-4sKv","user":{"login":"klsince","id":61892277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODkyMjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61892277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince","html_url":"https://github.com/klsince","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T05:52:37Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T05:52:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hmm.. interesting. do you have logs to help me locate the code where the deletion logic skips rollup segments?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1055048367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1055207945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8254#issuecomment-1055207945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8254","id":1055207945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c4-5TIJ","user":{"login":"KKcorps","id":5559703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTk3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5559703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps","html_url":"https://github.com/KKcorps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T09:26:29Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T09:26:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That also works.

And bumping up jdk version to 11 in the offline world is non-trivial since there are a lot dependencies/components that need to be Java 11 compatible (e.g. Hadoop 3.0+ needs to be used, etc). I also tried out the Pinot Java 11 compiled code in current offline env but since Java 8 is being used there, there is no way to run the Pinot Java 11 compiled code there (it's not allowed to run code compiled in higher jdk version in a lower jvm version). What's the plan for these jdk8 modules? Will they be left in Presto? If that's the case, we may also need some **extra** modules to be jdk 8 compatible.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > For LinkedIn internal, you can always use the parameter to build JDK 8 binary code jars and publish them to internal artifactory.

After splitting out to the separate modules, will the existing modules like `pinot-core` or `pinot-common` still be jdk 8 compatible?

Do they need to copy over to a jdk 8 compatible modules?\r\n\r\nFor pinot-avro etc, so far I don't find the need for moving to publish jdk8 jars.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1055800378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1055825905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8182#issuecomment-1055825905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8182","id":1055825905,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c4-7p_x","user":{"login":"suddendust","id":84911643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTExNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84911643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust","html_url":"https://github.com/suddendust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddendust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T20:22:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T20:35:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@walterddr Haven't had a chance to dive-deep into this, but one thing is confirmed that it's not just the metadata hanging around, it's complete segments.

I am also working on factoring out the helper functions from ControllerTestUtils. \r\n\r\nHere is what I proposed to do, please kindly let me know if this is the right track:\r\n\r\n1. summarized all the helper/utils we currently have. (in addition to the ones discussed above, many of the `*RestResource` in controller/broker have internal static functions to do send request and parse responses)\r\n2. proposal to add different level of abstractions. \r\n    - HTTPUtils in pinot-common (for constructing pinot get/post/put/delete to RestAPI and parsing response objects)\r\n    - ControllerUtils that utilizes the HTTPUtils to make specific requests such as getSchema, getTableConfig, etc.\r\n    - JavaClient that wraps around the ControllerUtils and is cluster-context aware (e.g. able to configure controller URL during start up and keeps tracking the active controller)\r\n3. tests to ensure that they are RestAPI compatible; and ensure the client API and controller API are in sync.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I will create an example PR to demonstrate what I meant soon","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1058636542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1058749310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8292#issuecomment-1058749310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8292","id":1058749310,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c4_Gzt-","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T01:58:06Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T18:40:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8292?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8292](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8292?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (556a203) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/46ed731c4e60c308c9559e46349a984b0ce05ce6?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (46ed731) will **decrease** coverage by `1.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `87.87%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8292/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8292?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8292      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.83%   69.81%   -1.02%     \n- Complexity     4245     4247       +2     \n============================================\n  Files          1631     1631              \n  Lines         85462    85487      +25     \n  Branches      12877    12879       +2     \n============================================\n- Hits          60539    59687     -852     \n- Misses        20746    21663     +917     \n+ Partials       4177     4137      -40     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `29.05% <0.00%> (+0.06%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `66.98% <87.87%> (+0.02%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `14.20% <0.00%> (+0.03%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

How does something like this look? @yupeng9 \r\n\r\n```\r\nprefixesToRename: [\r\n    {\r\n         \"prefixName\": \"after.\"\r\n         \"prefixReplace\": \"\"\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\nIn terms of avoiding collisions with same column names, perhaps we can add a validation check when the table config is added? I believe there's similar validation checks in place currently for comparing column names in the configs against the schema cc @icefury71 \r\n\r\nAlso since the general idea is to allow for renaming columns from the source data upon ingestion, we could also end up expanding on this via some different approaches. One approach could be to specify the exact full column names we want to rename, and specify what we want to rename it to, like how we have that capability in transform configs. Another approach would be to apply the config in batch, so like batch removing/renaming common prefixes, or batch converting snake_case to camelCase, etc. so that it's not tedious to specify everything like in the first approach. For this PR, I was thinking of just starting with `prefixRename` but definitely appreciate any thoughts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1059521835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1059533241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8300#issuecomment-1059533241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8300","id":1059533241,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c4_JzG5","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T21:10:58Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T21:10:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jackie-Jiang  @richardstartin  @mayankshriv Please help review this PR.
