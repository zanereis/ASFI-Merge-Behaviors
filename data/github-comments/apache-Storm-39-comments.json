create a method that essentially returns a boolean in response to the question \"Is this a tick tuple?\".<br/>\nNow I see two ways of doing this:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>A helper class with a static method. i.e.  TupleHelper.isTickTuple(Tuple t)</li>\n\t<li>An addition to the \"Tuple\" interface with a method \"isTick\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>I thing the latter is nicer because that also makes it very easy for application developers to handle ticks correctly.</p>\n\n<p>In both scenarios the code would essentially be </p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent

doesn't handle ticks properly</p>\n\n<p>    I implemented this by <br/>\n    1.   Adding an 'boolean isTick()' method to the Tuple interface. <br/>\n   This way it is for application builders much easier to  determine if the tuple at hand is a Tick or not.<br/>\n    2.   Letting the KafkaBolt use that method to ignore the ticks.<br/>\n    3.   Updating the other place in the code base that handles ticks differently to use this new method.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/nielsbasjes/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/nielsbasjes/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-512\" title=\"KafkaBolt doesn&#39;t handle ticks properly\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-512\"><del>STORM-512</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/275.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/275.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #275</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 6c6bec9b1b2b07b5dfb5000297c11911eda5389d<br/>\nAuthor: Niels Basjes <nbasjes@bol.com><br/>\nDate:   2014-10-01T09:50:48Z</p>\n\n<p>    New method in the Tuple interface \"boolean isTuple()\" for easier handling of TickTuples.</p>\n\n<p>commit 73e54a8f8b0ef9a62955c7c1cee20925d359772b<br/>\nAuthor: Niels Basjes <nbasjes@bol.com><br/>\nDate:   2014-10-01T09:51:42Z</p>\n\n<p>    KafkaBolt no longer tries to map/process/send Tick Tuples to Kafka.</p>\n\n<p>commit 8888ae631360ad124af9c480d2f8b621b9c51727<br/>\nAuthor: Niels Basjes <nbasjes@bol.com><br/>\nDate:   2014-10-01T09:53:17Z</p>\n\n<p>    Use isTick in all relevant places to avoid code duplication.</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612502007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/57460124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/267#issuecomment-57460124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/267","id":57460124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDYwMTI0","user":{"login":"d2r","id":905298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r","html_url":"https://github.com/d2r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-01T13:10:06Z","updated_at":"2014-10-01T13:10:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @d2r @revans2 I ran a test with this PR the topology stats missing complete latency and ack, fail numbers and also spout.\n\nDoes the topology have acking enabled?

href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/254\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/254</a></p>\n\n<p>    The KafkaSpout keeps track of failed messages through multiple retries, and delays their resubmission to the topology with an exponentially increasing delay time. The spout does not terminate the retry cycle (it is my conviction that it should not do so, because it cannot report context about the failure that happened to abort the reqeust), it only handles delaying the retries. A bolt in the topology is still expected to eventually call ack() instead of fail() to stop the cycle.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git

exponential backoff</p>\n\n<p>    This is an implementation of the improvement request <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-495\" title=\"Add delayed retries to KafkaSpout\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-495\"><del>STORM-495</del></a>:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-495\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-495</a></p>\n\n<p>    The KafkaSpout keeps track of failed messages through multiple retries, and delays their resubmission to the topology with an exponentially increasing delay time.  The spout does not terminate the retry cycle (it is my conviction that it should not do so, because it cannot report context about the failure that happened to abort the reqeust), it only handles delaying the retries.  A bolt in the topology is still expected to eventually call ack() instead of fail() to stop the cycle.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git
