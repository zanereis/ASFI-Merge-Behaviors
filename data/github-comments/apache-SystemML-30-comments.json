@prithvirajsen.  I agree that we should compare individual layers with other systems at some point in the near future.  As for the commented out `parfor` loops, I originally wanted to use them, but they first caused exceptions (fixed in master), and then they end up being slower.  The builtin `conv2d*` functions are internally multithreaded, but if they are run in the context of a local `parfor`, they are reduced to single-threaded ops, and the overall runtime slows down (~1.5x - 2x in my quick tests).  It's worth exploring more at some point, because for large numbers of channels >> the number of the examples, the `parfor` loops could possibly be faster.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/309565158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/309592923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/527#issuecomment-309592923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/527","id":309592923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTU5MjkyMw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-19T22:36:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T22:36:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"well, it's hard to estimate that but I would guess it would be in the order of 2-3 person years to make it work for all backends and operations.

can you also post the computation \"plan\" for the problematic function both  with and without the `if (1==1) {}` hack?  The \"plan\" is basically the graph of operations within the engine, and we have a mechanism of printing out that graph.  There are a few different levels, such as HOPS (high level operations in the optimizer, without any notion of Spark, drivers, Java, etc.), RUNTIME (the actual ops being run on either Spark, plain Java, etc.), etc.  From the API, there is a `setExplain` function that can turn plan explanations on/off, and a `setExplainLevel` to change the type of plans exposed.\r\n\r\nAll together, the error message and the plans will help to debug the actual issue, which seems to be an internal issue that is causing a matrix size to be set to an incorrect value.
