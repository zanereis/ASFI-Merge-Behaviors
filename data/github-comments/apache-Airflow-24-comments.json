We are committed in making it easy to keep the overhead of each task under a minute or so.\n\nKnowing this, if you run a lot of sub-minute tasks, overhead becomes an important percentage of your overall timeline. Also note that the platform might become \"metadata-heavy\". If you were to use Airflow to run millions of sub-second task, the overhead would considerably outweigh the actual work.\n\nStream processing solutions are much better suited for many use cases. Check out Spark Streaming,  Samza, Storm or Heron to see whether they better satisfy your use case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/174732982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/174763082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/743#issuecomment-174763082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/743","id":174763082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDc2MzA4Mg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T01:42:02Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T01:42:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"What about using environment variables instead?\nhttp://pythonhosted.org/airflow/installation.html#configuration\n\nDynamically generating commands based on keys in a config file and running them to catch their stdout seem like a not so great idea...\n\nAlso python in general and the whole airflow codebase uses PEP8 as a style guideline.

@syvineckruyk\n\nCurrently, SLA miss checks are done in the scheduler. Each worker or executor will execute an operator. The central scheduler (or perhaps another daemon in the future) queries the DB to figure out which tasks are falling behind and sends a report of all tasks that have missed their SLAs in a single email. In that centralized logic, I added the callback hook to allow for similar notifications : I currently publish the list of delayed tasks to both VictorOps and Slack. Here's a screen capture of the Slack Notification for one execution of a callback -- 2 tasks were behind. \n\n<img width=\"620\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-01-28 11 19 13\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/581734/12656056/fdcc4fb0-c5b0-11e5-9ac3-db7065edf68a.png\">\n\nThough each task defines its SLAs, the detection and reporting of the SLA misses happens in the scheduler in jobs.py.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/176354580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/176356461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/924#issuecomment-176356461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/924","id":176356461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjM1NjQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T19:26:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T19:45:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 This is something we need as well. We have all sorts of 3rd party API integrations that require some sort of key management solution (VictorOps/PagerDuty, Loggly/SumoLogic/LogEntries/DataDog/, Slack, etc...).

This is a good feature request.\n\nThe argument could be made that all 3rd party integrations be developed via hooks that use connections and leveraged via operators (if I understand the relationship between those concepts correctly), but it's better to offer the encrypted variable route as well as that makes it easier for people using the general-purpose PythonOperator to make API calls out to 3rd parties. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/176356461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/176367118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/924#issuecomment-176367118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/924","id":176367118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjM2NzExOA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T19:42:05Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T19:42:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This seems interesting.
