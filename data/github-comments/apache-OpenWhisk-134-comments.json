Have a dedicated separate dispatcher for db operations\r\n2. Dispatcher being tuned per DB driver implementation\r\n\r\nCurrently we have few storage impls which use Akka HTTP stack like CouchDB, S3 and ElasticSearch. So for them I think it would be better to have a generic `db-dispatcher` which is used by default. If any setup needs specific tuning then config can still be overridden for that deployment and later we can see if it makes sense to use a dedicated dispatcher for that kind of db.\r\n\r\nSo to start with lets have a generic `db-dispatcher` and later based on learning we can define specific one. This would allow us to at least meet 1 and still enabling option for 2.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
