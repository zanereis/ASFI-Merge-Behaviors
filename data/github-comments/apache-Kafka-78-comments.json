The metadata update in the clients is blocking, so `poll()` wouldn't even return if the request itself was delayed. It looks more like it is getting old (in some of these cases empty) metadata and not recovering.

Certainly the large timeouts and low refresh interval seems like it should work, but it seems like something else is going unexpectedly wrong.

It looks like there's a race condition with the initial metadata fetch and the initial rebalance. We don't actually ensure that the metadata is fresh before joining initially, but we request the metadata update. If that metadata update arrives while the rebalance is still pending (for example, when the join group is still inflight), then we will lose track of the fact that we need to rebalance again to reflect the change to the topic subscription. This seems to be a general problem that we haven't considered before. Any metadata update which changes the topic subscriptions and arrives with a rebalance in progress will essentially be ignored.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/231870538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/231873263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1594#issuecomment-231873263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1594","id":231873263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTg3MzI2Mw==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T21:36:55Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T21:36:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A quick fix which doesn't address the problem completely, but which should get the tests passing again would be to do something like this in `ConsumerCoordinator.ensurePartitionAssignment()`:\n\n``` java\n        if (subscriptions.partitionsAutoAssigned()) {\n            if (subscriptions.hasPatternSubscription())\n                client.ensureFreshMetadata();\n            ensureActiveGroup();\n        }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/231873263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/231879660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1594#issuecomment-231879660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1594","id":231879660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTg3OTY2MA==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T22:03:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T22:03:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Thanks a lot for the explanation and the suggested fix.

I quote an additional part from the documentation:\n\n\"When the KDC receives a session ticket for renewal, it checks a second expiration time held in the renew-till field. This time is set when the ticket is first issued; the value is the session ticket's starttime plus the maximum cumulative ticket life specified by the Kerberos policy. When the KDC renews the ticket, it checks to see that the renew-till time has not yet arrived. If it has not arrived, the KDC issues a new instance of the session ticket with a later endtime and a new session key.\"\n\nSo, we are checking the renew-till field ourselves and not renewing it in that case. Are you suggesting that we should not check that field and only let the KDC check it? It seems to me that it would result in the same behaviour, but potentially more calls to the KDC.\n\nBy the way, I did come across a few bugs in `KerberosLogin` a while back and created an initial

I looked into SASL scenario and it looks like SASL is a bit off than other scenarios where we handle `ApiVersionRequest` in `SaslServerAuthenticator` itself, which means if a client wants to get api versions before SASL authentication, it is allowed. I think in KIP-43 we wanted to add this support to let clients know supported versions of `SaslHandshakeRequest`. Do we currently have a reason to do so? Maybe @rajinisivaram will have some thought here. The current changes will work even for SASL scenario, however if we really want to handle multiple versions of `SaslHandshakeRequest`, we need to get api versions before SASL authentication, and we have following options for that.\n1. Move down whole api version checking from `NetworkClient` to `KafkaChannel`. Have `KafkaChannel` maintain supported api versions. Clients will access api versions info from the channel.\n2. As Sasl authentication has a special handling for `ApiVersionRequest`, only have api versions fetched for the Sasl scenario in `authenticator` and put a check in `NetworkClient` to go to `READY` state from `CONNECTED`, skipping `CHECKING_API_VERSIONS`.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/232095144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/232129624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1615#issuecomment-232129624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1615","id":232129624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjEyOTYyNA==","user":{"login":"SinghAsDev","id":4915557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTU1NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4915557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev","html_url":"https://github.com/SinghAsDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T18:05:19Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T18:05:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Left a few comments, otherwise LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/232129624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/232137603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1594#issuecomment-232137603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1594","id":232137603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjEzNzYwMw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T18:32:15Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T18:32:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

Perhaps a separate request from `SaslClientAuthenticator`to fetch only the supported versions of `SaslHandshakeRequest` would be neater? That way, you don't need to propagate the list of used APIs to the authenticator or the versions back to the NetworkClient. The rest of the code can stay as is. It would mean an additional `ApiVersionsRequest` for Sasl, but perhaps that is ok. If that is the agreed approach, you could add a comment in `SaslClientAuthenticator` and perhaps defer implementation until a new version of `SaslHandshakeRequest` is required.
