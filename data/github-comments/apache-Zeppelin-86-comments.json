@AhyoungRyu , I have added `bigquery` in the following commit.\nBTW, I don't this is a good idea to define the interpreter order in this way. Because it brings extra overhead when adding new interpreter. And I think it will break when we have multiple interpreter setting for the same interpreter (e.g. 2 interpreter setting for spark, one for spark1, another for spark2).\n\nSo I am thinking that maybe we can allow user to define the ordering in the interpreter page, the available interpreter can be fetched through rest api. So that we won't miss any interpreter when new interpreter is added.  \\cc @Leemoonsoo @jongyoul \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242660611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242680230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1366#issuecomment-242680230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1366","id":242680230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjY4MDIzMA==","user":{"login":"astroshim","id":3348133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDgxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim","html_url":"https://github.com/astroshim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astroshim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T09:34:08Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T09:34:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM. :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242680230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242682053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1362#issuecomment-242682053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1362","id":242682053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjY4MjA1Mw==","user":{"login":"vensant","id":12062069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDYyMDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12062069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant","html_url":"https://github.com/vensant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vensant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T09:41:07Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T09:41:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code changes done as per the review comment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242682053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/242714033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1362#issuecomment-242714033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1362","id":242714033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjcxNDAzMw==","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T11:52:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T11:52:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vensant Thank you!
