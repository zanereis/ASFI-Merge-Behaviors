We already have a lot of long-running type tasks. These tasks are basically plug-in. We didn't support orchestration before. Now I hope to do the orchestration.\r\n2. We have a self-built scheduled task scheduling management service. At present, we only want to introduce a module that can do dependency management and task flow scheduling.\r\n3. We have our own security and auditing considerations, so managing data sources, tracking task status, and the like are all done by ourselves or adapted to meet the requirements. Including alarms, we also need to take our unified alarm channel.\r\n\r\nSo the form we prefer is:\r\n1. Self-built timing scheduling service is responsible for task flow triggering.\r\n2. Dedicated services are responsible for dependency management and subtask triggering.\r\n3. There is a client api abstracting communication with the server. The custom worker can have the function of the task in the task flow scheduling as long as the api is introduced.\r\n\r\nThanks again to EsSchduler for open source.\r\n\r\n---\r\n感谢，正在阅读。\r\n\r\n有以下几个考虑：\r\n1.我们已经有很多long-running类型的任务，这些任务也基本上是插件化的，之前不支持编排，现在希望能做编排。\r\n2.我们有有自建的定时任务调度管理服务，目前只想引入一个能做依赖管理，任务流调度的模块。\r\n3.我们有自己的安全和审计考虑，所以管理数据源，追踪任务状态之类的工作都是要自己实现的或者改造到符合要求。包括告警，我们也需要走我们统一的告警通道。\r\n\r\n所以我们更希望的形式是：\r\n1.自建的定时调度服务负责任务流触发。\r\n2.专门的服务负责依赖管理和子任务触发。\r\n3.有一个客户端api抽象了跟服务端的通信，自定义的worker只要引入这个api即可具备任务流调度中worker的功能。\r\n\r\n再次感谢EsSchduler的开源。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/478950757/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/478971642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1#issuecomment-478971642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1","id":478971642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODk3MTY0Mg==","user":{"login":"boandai","id":48329107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzI5MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48329107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai","html_url":"https://github.com/boandai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T12:23:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T12:23:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/analysys/EasyScheduler/releases   1.0.0  has  been published！ ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/478971642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/478973781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4#issuecomment-478973781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4","id":478973781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODk3Mzc4MQ==","user":{"login":"boandai","id":48329107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzI5MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48329107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai","html_url":"https://github.com/boandai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boandai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T12:30:21Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T12:30:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you very much for your advice.
