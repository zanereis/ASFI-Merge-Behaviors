[snowplow](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow). The former seems to support Druid more painlessly than the latter, but it's unclear if it's used at scale and maintained actively. Are there any other projects that do clickstream ingestion on web that we should be looking at?\r\n> \r\n> More generally: If you're using Druid for user activity or clickstream data, what does your stack look like?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks!\r\n\r\nHi Dhaivat. \r\nI am using Druid for my project [Adsgraphy](https://adsgraphy.com) in production. I must say that I am glad that I chose Druid over other databases. My project involves storing of clickstream and then generating various reports on that data for different data. \r\nAlthough there are many companies using it at scale one of them is Kochava which certainly has a high amount of clickstream data. I am in the early days of our company product launch. And my project is ingesting 30-50 million clicks per day. \r\nHope that helps.\r\nPawan

waiting tasks from piling up, if the strategy is waiting for existing workers to drain after a disable before provisioning a new one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/575862104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/575869277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9215#issuecomment-575869277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9215","id":575869277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NTg2OTI3Nw==","user":{"login":"suneet-s","id":44787917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Nzg3OTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44787917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s","html_url":"https://github.com/suneet-s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suneet-s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-18T05:41:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T05:41:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
