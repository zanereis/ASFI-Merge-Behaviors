I think we can then come to an agreement that both syntaxes (double quotes and square brackets) should be parseable by the MetaModel query parser.\n\n@ashwinrayaprolu1984 - For now I think you want this feature just for for table references, but in the future I would love to see it also for other references (columns and maybe more). Maybe if you can separate the tokenizer logic here so that we can reuse it for other parsing purposes. I imagine a tokenizer that would be delimiter aware, so that\n- `\"foo bar\" baz` becomes `foo bar` and `baz`\n- `[foo bar] baz` becomes `foo bar` and `baz`\n- `[foo bar] [baz]` becomes `foo bar` and `baz`\n- `[foo bar] baz \"hello world\"` becomes `foo bar` and `baz` and `hello world`\n\n(already there you have the input for a unittest of the parser ;-))\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/155358929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/155359607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/72#issuecomment-155359607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/72","id":155359607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTM1OTYwNw==","user":{"login":"ashwinrayaprolu","id":8037381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzczODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8037381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwinrayaprolu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwinrayaprolu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T08:45:48Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T08:45:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure

We could add those schemes too, if that's what you mean? But the way of accessing them will be through HDFS - or at least via the _hadoop (pause) FileSystem_ (class). If it makes things more clear, we could create a new class instead, called \"HadoopResource\" which would cover all the different schemes (and could then hold _just_ an URI instead of the individual URI elements).\n\nI just now tried to see if I could do the URI assembly in a more reusing way. Encountered the following small issues:\n- UriBuilder is part of JAX-RS (and there is also one in apache HTTP components). I think it would be unfortunate to depend on an optional library just to do this.\n- So then I tried instead the URI class...\n  - That requires me to catching a URISyntaxException which will never happen. A bit annoying IMO.\n  - It changes a small thing in one of the test cases. In the case of `emrfs:///home/metamodel.txt` it shortens it by removing two slashes, making it just `emrfs:/home/metamodel.txt`.

You're right that it would override `fs.defaultFS`, and initially that was also my intention. I see that HADOOP_CONF_DIR and YARN_CONF_DIR has become standards used by libraries such as Apache Spark and others. I was thinking it would be nice to reuse that standard so that configuration in MetaModel is as easy as possible... BUT of course you're right that it might be that the environment variable is unintentionally set up to configure a _different_ hadoop installation. Hmm then I guess we shouldn't check for environment variables or system properties, but rather only use the constructor argument as a way of configuring it. Then applications that are using MetaModel have to do their own environment variable checking, if it's applicable in their situations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/164189119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/164190432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/78#issuecomment-164190432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/78","id":164190432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDE5MDQzMg==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T20:52:14Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T20:52:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK as you can now see from the latest commit (0e0a9fb4c76ce396f15c66094f52abf8bb366a0a) I have added a system property `metamodel.hadoop.use_hadoop_conf_dir` which can be set to \"true\" in order to enable the HADOOP_CONF_DIR and YARN_CONF_DIR checks.

For me this is also a bit uncertain how we fix it, but I can show you at least where the problem lies and then we might contemplate ways to fix.\n\nIf you look at QueryPostprocessDataContext you will find a fairly big method, `executeQuery(Query)`, which handles the first stuff about identifying the select items (each representing a column - or so we thought) to include from each queried table. If you look at line 185 the final \"workSelectItems\" is assembled for this.\n\nNow the \"issue\" (as I see it) is that each select item may represent 1+n columns. And in line 192 we call materializeFromItem(...) with this list. So either we fix it in the materializeFromItem method, or maybe even before we go there.

However, this `Document`, which is the `org.bson.Document` is only in the mongodb driver 3.x. So I do a little things to remove functions which contain `Document` .\n\nI've added 'scoped' in pom. However, I think maybe there is some risk in it. For developer, in the IDE such as Eclipse, Eclipse will still think we using mongodb 3.x, so developer maybe write wrong functions which can not work in both mongodb 2.x and mongodb 3.x. \n3.  move unclear function convertArrayToList to right place\nThis function is used for converting array `[1,3,4]` to List. \nHere is the problem code in the test \n    `ds = dataContext.query().from(getCollectionName()).select(\"id\").and(\"name\").where(\"id\").in(2, 6, 8, 9)`\n\nIn the `in` where condition, metamodel will convert `in` parameter to an array object `[2,6,8,9]`.
