the discussion on exception handling back to the top level, and adding more thoughts.\n\n## Exceptions and Closing\n\nSuppose you're an iterator.  You call `next()` or `seek()` on your source and it throws an IOException.  I would treat this the same as if `hasTop()` returned false; no more data is available from your source.  The iterator stack will not necessarily be torn down. The bottom of the iterator stack might seek to the next range, for example (not sure if this actually happens).\n\nAccumulo should _guarantee_ that `close()` will be called before an iterator is torn down, say via try-finally, except in extreme cases like OOM.  I see two approaches to doing this:\n1. Specify the contract that every iterator _must_ `close()` its source.  This strategy works if every iterator, system and user-defined, follows the contract.  Existing iterators would need to be modified to do this, so it's a breaking change.\n2. Retain the list of `IterInfo`s from when Accumulo sets up the iterator stack (see `IteratorUtil.loadIterators()`). Before Accumulo tears down the stack, for any reason, call `close()` on each iterator individually, say starting from the root RFile/InMemoryMap iterators and working down (top-down vs. bottom-up order may not matter). This strategy would not break existing iterators; an iterator that does not call `close()` on its source is fine since Accumulo would call it. It also provides better iterator isolation.\n\n## Idempotent\n\nI think `close()` _must_ be idempotent; calling `close()` more than once should have the same effect as calling `close()` once. We should document the requirement. This would also suggest changing `AutoCloseable` to `Closeable`.\n\nIf we don't require idempotency, then option 2 above is not viable and we should carefully engineer the implementation for _exactly-once_ semantics. Seems difficult. Also, can anyone think of a use case that requires exactly-once semantics?\n\n## Less certain ideas\n\nBecause discussion is good =)\n\n### \"Reason\" for Closing\n\nIt would be awesome if the iterator knew _why_ Accumulo is closing it. This doesn't mesh well with the `AutoCloseable` interface.  Otherwise I would suggest passing a `Reason` interface parameter to the `close()` method.  Reasons include \"the client stopped requesting tuples\" or \"switching source\" or \"starting migration\" or \"tuple returned outside of seek fence for this tablet\" or \"out of fairness to other concurrent scans\" or \"client cancelled scan\". Something like\n\n```\n@Override\ndefault void close() {\n  close(Reason.UNKNOWN);\n}\n\ndefault void close(Reason reason) {\n  // default implementation, do nothing\n}\n```\n\nIt's fine if we don't do the `Reason`. It would make try-with-resources awkward. Then again, how often (if ever) would iterators be constructed in try-with-resources blocks?\n\nI'm also not sure what use cases need this. It seems helpful to provide the iterators with this information, but maybe it's not necessary.\n\n### Put `close()` in `finalize()` for safety\n\nYes, we know the JVM does not guarantee `finalize()` would ever be called. But it would be a nice \"safety\" against bugs in Accumulo that cause Accumulo to forgo calling `close()` as it normally must. In SKVI.java:\n\n```\n@Override\nprotected void finalize() throws Throwable {\n  super.finalize();\n  close();\n}\n```\n\nObviously we cannot do this if we don't require `close()` idempotency.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/261689992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/261973694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/186#issuecomment-261973694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/186","id":261973694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTk3MzY5NA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T15:42:27Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T15:42:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Its merge method became something like the following :\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public void merge(String summaryKey, long v1, long v2){\r\n     switch(summaryKey){\r\n        case \"deletes\":\r\n        case \"total\":\r\n           return v1 + v2;\r\n        case \"minStamp\":\r\n          return Math.min(v1, v2);\r\n       case \"maxStamp\":\r\n          return Math.max(v1,v2);\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I went to change `ColumnVisibilitySummarizer` to the new interface and found it would not work at all.  Maybe we could offer a an Abstract subclass that has an abstract `merge(String, long, long)` method?  I might try this just to see what it looks like.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/265192712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/265206129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/190#issuecomment-265206129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/190","id":265206129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTIwNjEyOQ==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T16:59:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T16:59:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Gave it a glance, looks fine to me!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/265206129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/265281773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/180#issuecomment-265281773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/180","id":265281773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTI4MTc3Mw==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T21:42:48Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T21:42:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have been thinking about the case of a buggy summarizer and the possibility of adding an explicit version numbers to serializers.

Many (if not all) of these services acquire a ZooKeeper lock before they start. My original idea was that instead of duplicating this logic across each service, we can have a common abstract class which encapsulates the logic of acquiring a ZK lock and then starting the service. Then, we wouldn't have to ask the question \"Does service X have log messages around zk lock acquisition?\", instead asking \"Does service X extend _LockAcquiringService_\" or something.\r\n\r\nI think we'd be better off restructuring the code to remove the duplication.

I would appreciate if you point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nYou've had a little bit of experience here, seeing what Thrift generates and how to implement the server-side interface.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, think about the Accumulo Java 'Public API' is a wrapper around the Thrift RPCs. Client-side, we also have the Thrift generated code. Typically, the public API call would call either `MasterClient.execute(..)`, `ServerClient.execute(..)`, or `ThriftUtil.getTServerClient(..)`. These calls are for Master RPCs, RPC to any TabletServer, or RPC to a specific TabletServer, respectively.\r\n\r\nI would not worry about doing a low-level test case, instead, build some public API method and then write a test around that new method. I think adding a method to `InstanceOperations` makes the most sense here.\r\n\r\nIf we decide that we don't want to make a new public API call for this, using `MasterClient.execute` to invoke the `getMasterStats(..)` method. https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/e900e67425d950bd4c0c5288a6270d7b362ac458/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/client/impl/InstanceOperationsImpl.java#L69-L74 is an example of how to invoke this method. Hopefully this will be very straightforward to do with any of the existing test classes that extend AccumuloClusterIT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/272016746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/273305495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/201#issuecomment-273305495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/201","id":273305495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzMwNTQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"phrocker","id":1781585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker","html_url":"https://github.com/phrocker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phrocker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T21:28:26Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T21:28:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/273305495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/273312235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/201#issuecomment-273312235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/201","id":273312235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzMxMjIzNQ==","user":{"login":"joshelser","id":67863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser","html_url":"https://github.com/joshelser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshelser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T21:54:18Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T21:54:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Forgot
