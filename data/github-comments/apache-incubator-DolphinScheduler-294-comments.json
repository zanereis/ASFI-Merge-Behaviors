is the purpose of this feature？**\r\nDS can support the task instance running on the remote servers (task server), not just worker nodes. \r\nUsers can manage these task servers on the page, such as create, edit, delete and test connect.\r\nEach task node in DAG can specify the task server that needs to be executed. \r\nThe task server property belongs only to task instances, not workflow instances.\r\n**MOP**\r\n1. Add TaskServer Entity in _dolphinscheduler-dao_ model, and create a table named **t_ds_task_server** in DB. Add TaskServer API.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20518339/188169786-fc95225a-3b57-4c80-bdb5-63740d151d26.png)\r\n2. Add a task **server manage page** in Secerity menu, such as create, delete, edit and test connect.\r\n3. Add a task server select input (field: **taskServerCode**) in Shell and Python task form.\r\n4. Add taskServerCode column in **t_ds_task_instance、t_ds_task_definition、t_ds_task_definition_log tables**. And change these APIs.\r\n5. Add taskServerCode field in **TaskInstance, TaskDefintion, TaskDefinitionLog, TaskNode**, and add **taskServerInfo** field in **TaskInstance** (not a table field).\r\n6. Add **taskServerInfo** (just contain ip, user, password, name) entity in dolphinscheduler-task-plugin model. And add taskServerInfo field in TaskExecutionContext. \r\n7. Shell and Python task will check **TaskExecutionContext.getTaskServerInfo()**, if not null, it will scp the command files and resource files to the task server, and send the start command to remote to exec it. If other task plugin need this feture,  can also check this task server field.\r\n8. The task will ssh and scp to the task server as the DS running user, not tenant.\r\n\r\nLook forward to your comments.

> @kezhenxu94 Sorry for the late response. I understand that 11402 could allow users to modify the configs without restarting the components and the configs can be reloaded at runtime.\r\n> \r\n> Hi, do you also know that the configs also works at startup phase, not only at runtime? Meaning when you create a config map with the desired configurations, the components will pick them up when starting\r\n\r\nHi, @kezhenxu94 , thanks for the response. I know that the configs work at startup phase, and this is exactly the purpose of this PR. This PR mainly mounts the configuration directory through `configmap` so that users can avoid rebuilding the docker image if he wants to modify the configs before deploying DS to k8s through Helm. \r\n\r\nMaybe I should explain my point more clearly:\r\n\r\n1. If users use Helm to deploy DS in a k8s cluster, each container will start the DS component with the configuration files in `/opt/dolphinscheduler/conf`\r\n2. DS cannot apply some configuration modifications at startup unless he modifies the configuration file in the docker image (Some configurations cannot be specified via `values.yaml`). E.g., he modifies the `application.yaml` and rebuilds the docker image with `ADD application.yaml to /opt/dolphinscheduler/conf` in Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nBut with this PR, if user wants to modify some cofigurations, he can just modify the configuration files in `deploy/kubernetes/dolphinscheduler/conf/<specific-server>/` and these configurations will automatically be mounted to `/opt/dolphinscheduler/conf` in each container without rebuilding the docker image","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236488501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236490032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11771#issuecomment-1236490032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11771","id":1236490032,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Js1cw","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T02:38:38Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T02:38:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your feedback, we have received your issue, Please wait patiently for a reply.\n* In order for us to understand your request as soon as possible, please provide detailed information、version or pictures.\n* If you haven't received a reply for a long time, you can [join our slack](https://s.apache.org/dolphinscheduler-slack) and send your question to channel `#troubleshooting`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236490032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236490676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11771#issuecomment-1236490676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11771","id":1236490676,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Js1m0","user":{"login":"fuchanghai","id":33984497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTg0NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33984497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai","html_url":"https://github.com/fuchanghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuchanghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T02:40:38Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T02:40:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"if guys think that  above should be fix ,i will fix the code of backend","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1236490676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
