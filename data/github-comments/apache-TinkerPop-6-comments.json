That is, most people, if they don't have the full \"star graph\" will have at least outgoing edges for each vertex (NOT incoming edges). I don't know why you require incoming edges, but okay... I assume you have your reasons. If you can make it work without that assumption, that would be best (I suppose).\n\nNext, I don't know how `StarGraph` plays into this. Is `StarGraph` failing with self-loops? `StarGraph` is serialized via `Gryo` (see `VertexWritable` as well). If GryoReader/Writer is happy, then I suspect things will work with all the Hadoop/Spark/etc. work. However, it would be best if we had some self-loop tests. What sucks is we don't have a `GraphLoader.SELF_LOOPS` style toy dataset and with `HadoopGraph`, you can't mutate the graph............................. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/167622062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/167773779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/184#issuecomment-167773779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/184","id":167773779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Nzc3Mzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T11:58:36Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T11:58:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All good with:\n\n``` text\nmvn clean install -DincludeNeo4j && mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false -DincludeNeo4j\n```\n\nThe approach makes sense to me.

I need them for my applications that use [wisdom-framework](https://github.com/wisdom-framework/wisdom) and TinkerPop, so I'll be vigilant...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/167961162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/168028642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/185#issuecomment-168028642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/185","id":168028642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODAyODY0Mg==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-30T16:28:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T16:28:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"These were minor changes to docs - merge by CTR\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/168028642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/168032109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/175#issuecomment-168032109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/175","id":168032109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODAzMjEwOQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-30T16:46:04Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T16:46:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think that anything is failing with `StarGraph`.

I will join those tests to this pull request soon.\n\nThat's interesting - you would be the first person to ever offer to supply tests for OSGi.  \n\nAnother addition to this PR that I think is important would be some documentation for TinkerPop Committers that serves as some reminder as to how to \"maintain\" these configuration and their meaning.  To me this is more internal developer docs - something that would go in this section somewhere:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/ef40dce314c1f9ee48661227d992beef8cad64d0/docs/src/dev/developer/contributing.asciidoc#for-committers\n\nFrom my limited understanding of OSGi, I would say user docs should be updated as part of \"Gremlin Applications\" section of the user docs. I guess there would be a new sub-section there of some sort.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/171016393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/171024783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/175#issuecomment-171024783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/175","id":171024783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTAyNDc4Mw==","user":{"login":"laxatives","id":16109646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA5NjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16109646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives","html_url":"https://github.com/laxatives","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T19:26:59Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T19:27:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks Stephen.\n\nIntegration test `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.\n\n```\nmvn clean install -DskipIntegrationTests=false -DincludeNeo4j\n...\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\n[INFO] \n[INFO] Apache TinkerPop ...................................

implemented an integration test to test that germlin-core is a valid OSGI bundle.\n  Unfortunately I don't manage to implement the same test for tinkerpop-gremlin because when I add my test
