@b-slim I took another look through the code, and with the change Gian suggested to remove segments if we discover someone already published it before us, I can't find any real scenario in which garbage would be left behind, other than if there are bugs in Druid's code, such as these sanity checks tripping in `AppenderatorImpl.mergeAndPush()`:\r\n```\r\n    // Sanity checks\r\n    for (FireHydrant hydrant : sink) {\r\n      if (sink.isWritable()) {\r\n        throw new ISE(\"WTF?! Expected sink to be no longer writable before mergeAndPush. Segment[%s].\", identifier);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      synchronized (hydrant) {\r\n        if (!hydrant.hasSwapped()) {\r\n          throw new ISE(\"WTF?! Expected sink to be fully persisted before mergeAndPush. Segment[%s].\", identifier);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these cases, if an exception was thrown after some segments had already been pushed, those segments would be orphaned. \r\n\r\nBut - my point here is that this is not something related at all to the `useUniquePath` functionality, nor is it something related to Kafka indexing exclusively. This is something that was always in Druid indexing and happens with every type of ingestion, where a sanity check failure due to broken Druid logic that causes the task to end prematurely does not clean up already pushed segments.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at it more closely, I'm leaning towards the opinion that it would actually cause more harm than good to explicitly call it out in documentation since it would scare people unnecessarily. Folks who view this as a major issue should already have been running periodic consistency checks comparing deep storage to the metadata storage.\r\n\r\nI think it might be interesting to write a tool, sorta like a 'druid-fsck', that can validate the consistency of the deep storage and clean up orphans, but that would be for another time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/385142828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/385151256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5556#issuecomment-385151256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5556","id":385151256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTE1MTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"zhangxinyu1","id":12528894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTI4ODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12528894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxinyu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-28T08:06:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T08:11:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson \r\n>>Also please add some documentation.

interesting proposal, thanks. Notes:\r\n\r\n - There is a plan to globally departure from using ByteBuffer in Druid, we are going to use https://github.com/DataSketches/memory. In order not to do some work twice and conversions between `ByteBuffer` and `Memory` APIs back and forth, maybe you could already base your Oak code on the Memory library. You might want to talk with with @leerho about that.\r\n - Instead of adding more incremental index variants (your refactoring plan suggests existence of four), it would be better if everything have converged on the minimum number implementations, that work in all use cases reasonably well. E. g. I plan to make a change that will leave just one IncrementalIndex implementation (on-heap, but \"serialized\" in `Memory` objects), instead of current two: OnHeap and OffHeap. This is mentioned in the last paragraph of this message: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/5335#issue-166870792. However, my idea doesn't touch present `ConcurrentSkipListMap`-based machinery. It would be nice to combine that ideas with concurrency and key handling from Oak, and thus have just one IncrementalIndex. In the materials that you provided I see mentions of tests with 1K-sized values. For Druid, very small values (8 bytes) are important, so they might need to be tested too.\r\n - Another thing that might be important - Druid needs variable-sized values, see the second half of this message: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/5335#issuecomment-365274611\r\n - I don't think there is a big issue with GC in our incremental index structures, because those heaps are quite small, < 10 GB. The bigger issue is the overhead of traditional Java object structures. That is why in the improvement that I planned (see above), I don't intend to move data off-heap, just reduce the overhead and flatten memory, storing data in `Memory` objects (read: `byte[]` buffers). On the other hand, it allows to simplify the concurrency model and take advantage of Java's GC. Buffers are shared among a small number of key-value pairs (e. g. 64) in order to reduce the overhead from `byte[]` and `Memory` headers themselves.\r\n - Currently concurrency of incremental indexes is inherently broken, because it doesn't synchronize between updates and reads: see #3956. Would Oak allow to solve this problem?

, thanks for taking a look! You have great comments!\r\n\r\n- Generally speaking Oak was written quite a while ago using ByteBuffers. The integration of the Oak to Druid is also almost done and we want to publish it soon for your review. We are good friends with Lee Rhodes and we know about his Memory library. We do not see any special advantage to use Memory over ByteBuffer internally at Oak, but definitely it can be an advantage in Druid. In order not to slow the progress I would suggest we publish the code as we have it just to get your impression. If required we can move it to Memory.\r\n\r\n- As we didn't yet feel comfortable to delete existing implementation, we just added our on top of what we saw as existing. It could be good for testing and benchmarking against the current implementation. In the future of course we can remain with one implementation. Regarding your plan about \"just one IncrementalIndex implementation (on-heap, but \"serialized\" in Memory objects)\", you can get it from Oak as Oak works off-heap and on heap and we can allocate ByteBuffer/Memory off-heap or on-heap. Clearly the objects on the ByteBuffer/Memory are serialized. Please note that with Oak you are getting much more than memory layout: the better concurrency, reacher and more efficient API, fast backward scans, etc. \r\n\r\n- Regarding your concern about small values. We work with them better than the ConcurrentSkipListMap as well. The off-heaping is less important with small values, but as mentioned Oak has more to suggest than just off-heaping. Of course all the benchmarks need to be repeated inside Druid. Here are the results \r\n[OakMap OnHeap with Integer Values.pdf](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/files/1959106/OakMap.OnHeap.with.Integer.Values.pdf)\r\n\r\n- \"Druid needs variable-sized values\": Oak definitely supports variable-sized values and keys! This was one of the initial design points.\r\n\r\n- Regarding your comment about GC and flattening. With 10GB heap, the GC efficiency depends on the number of objects. The smaller they are and more of them - worse. When working with ConcurrentSkipListMap and small key-value pairs, hundred of millions key-value pairs still make young generation garbage-collection stop time long. There are 2 problems of ConcurrentSkipListMap: (1) it needs 2 objects to store one key-value on expectation. One Index (skiplist's average node height is 1), one Node itself. (2) Recent inserted KeyValue and its map structure (Index, Node) are assigned on young generation. The card table (for CMS gc algorithm) or RSet (for G1 gc algorithm) will change frequently on high writing throughput, which makes YGC slow. However, I share your concern that we also spend too much memory on objects overheads as well. Oak flattens it all! Keys and values saved in buffers (or you name any other container) and also index itself uses arrays as much as possible.\r\n\r\n- Finally, clearly Oak cares for all the concurrency issues. It is design for concurrent updates/reads of the data it stores.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/385276069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/385282988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5698#issuecomment-385282988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5698","id":385282988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTI4Mjk4OA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-29T21:24:30Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T21:25:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> We do not see any special advantage to use Memory over ByteBuffer internally at Oak, but definitely it can be an advantage in Druid.

The allocated Memory objects are garbage. I don't think the overhead of those conversions is going to be prohibitive, but it could be considerable, so better avoided.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/385282988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/385288512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5681#issuecomment-385288512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5681","id":385288512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTI4ODUxMg==","user":{"login":"dylwylie","id":3107079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDcwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3107079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie","html_url":"https://github.com/dylwylie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylwylie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-29T22:57:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-29T22:57:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmm

\r\n\r\nThe facts are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe current internal implementation of Memory is heavily dependent on the `Unsafe` class, as many high-performance libraries do. However, the architecture of Memory has been designed so that a non-Unsafe implementation could be created without impacting the API. \r\n\r\nDruid has not moved to JDK 9 yet, nor have many of the other systems that currently use the library.  So there hasn't been a great deal of pressure to move to JDK 9, yet.  Nonetheless, when the time comes we will move to 9, 10, 11 or whatever.\r\n\r\nMy comment in the memory docs that you highlighted is simply the truth.  We have not had the time, resources or the requirement to move to JDK 9 or 10.  So it obviously hasn't been tested to work against JDK 9 or 10 either.   I'm clearly not going to guarantee code that hasn't been tested.  And I don't plan to start extensive testing until it becomes a requirement.  \r\n\r\nThere have been only 2 people heavily involved in the design and implementation of the Memory repository in DataSketches, @leventov and myself.

What are the blockers?  My understanding is that JDK9 allows access to Unsafe, but we have to add some code to access it. How and where do changes need to be made? My concern is that we will have to have a special code base for JDK9 that cannot be used with JDK8.  Please investigate.  You will need to create your own jars from master as the latest code has not been released to Maven Central yet.  Although I hope it will be soon.\r\n2) What about JDK10? Same questions. \r\n3) Once you have some answers as to where it breaks and what we need to do, we can strategize on the best way to go forward.  Don't submit any PR's, it is too early.  If you want to show us code we can look at code on your own repo. \r\n\r\nAs a longer range contribution, you could investigate VarHandles and MethodHandles.  Will they help at all?  I'm not convinced from what I have read, but I have not played with them yet.  If they look promising, you could do some detailed timing characterization and find out how they perform.\r\n\r\nThen there is the OpenJDK Panama Project and JEP 191.  These have been on the sideline for years, but if it they were ever adopted it would make life so much simpler for us.  Do some digging and find out where they are headed and when!
