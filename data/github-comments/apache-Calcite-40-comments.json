I use some test cases previously in RexProgromTest to verify the correctness of RexSimplify. I can keep working support more constructors such as CASE, or more types, such as DATE. \r\nanother question I have is I found there is a class is called RexImplicationChecker, Z3 can do a better job to check the implication between two RexNode. For example, the current RexImplicationChecker seems cannot verify that Not (a <=30 ) ==> a > 10. I am wondering If that would be a good use for z3.

So far none of the CI-profiles were failing, so I guess we can activate the feature flag for all of them, and disable it in the feature we add a JVM with the problematic symptoms.\r\n\r\nNot sure where the best place to activate the flag is, but `systemProperty(\"calcite.enable.enumerable.fieldIndexAccess\", true)` looks like the way to do it in Calcite's gradle scripts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/729599150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/729603530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2269#issuecomment-729603530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2269","id":729603530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTYwMzUzMA==","user":{"login":"xy2953396112","id":23030751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDMwNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23030751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112","html_url":"https://github.com/xy2953396112","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-18T10:59:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T10:59:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/729603530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/729623742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2189#issuecomment-729623742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2189","id":729623742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTYyMzc0Mg==","user":{"login":"xy2953396112","id":23030751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDMwNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23030751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112","html_url":"https://github.com/xy2953396112","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xy2953396112/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-18T11:39:27Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T11:39:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

I don't think that it improved things. Your change was based based on the idea that Calcite's standard `SUBSTRING` operator would have different semantics depending on the SQL engine that it is implemented on. That is a deeply flawed assumption.\r\n\r\nLet's log a follow-up bug (or bugs) to make sure that `SUBSTRING`, and Oracle `SUBSTR`, function correctly when we generate SQL against other engines, and make sure that the fixes include test cases.\r\n\r\nI have already logged https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4427 to restore standards-compliant behavior to the SUBSTRING operator and I am
