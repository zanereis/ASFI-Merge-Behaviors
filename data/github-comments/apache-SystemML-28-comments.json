Looks like we're setting up a `for` loop that pulls out each filter and applies them to the input `C/G` channels at a time.\r\n\r\nWould this be another way to achieve the same thing: Generate a filter that has the appropriate `0`s to represent the grouped filter. This way, we don't have to run a `for` loop when we call the forward function.\r\n\r\nShould be relatively easy to add a util function that takes a grouped filter and adds the requisite `0`s (`init_bilinear` in `nn/layers/conv2d_transpose.dml` does something like this).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/306251794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/306266908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/501#issuecomment-306266908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/501","id":306266908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjI2NjkwOA==","user":{"login":"nakul02","id":5394361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTQzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5394361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02","html_url":"https://github.com/nakul02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nakul02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T18:31:07Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T18:31:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It shows me an explain even when I haven't specified it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  incubator-systemml git:(master) ✗ bin/systemml-spark-submit.py -f matmult.dml               \r\n================================================================================\r\nOutput dir: /home/njindal/git/incubator-systemml/temp\r\n17/06/05 11:30:27 INFO api.DMLScript: BEGIN DML run 06/05/2017 11:30:27\r\n17/06/05 11:30:27 WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\n17/06/05 11:30:27 INFO api.DMLScript: EXPLAIN (RUNTIME):\r\n# Memory Budget local/remote = 3186MB/?MB/?MB/?MB\r\n# Degree of Parallelism (vcores) local/remote = 8/?\r\nPROGRAM ( size CP/SP = 10/0 )\r\n--MAIN PROGRAM\r\n----GENERIC (lines 1-8) [recompile=false]\r\n------CP createvar _mVar0 scratch_space//_p6710_127.0.1.1//_t0/temp0 true MATRIX binaryblock 1000 30000 1000 1000 30000000 copy\r\n------CP rand 1000 30000 1000 1000 0.0 1.0 1.0 -1 uniform 1.0 8 _mVar0.MATRIX.DOUBLE\r\n------CP createvar _mVar1 scratch_space//_p6710_127.0.1.1//_t0/temp1 true MATRIX binaryblock 30000 1000 1000 1000 30000000 copy\r\n------CP rand 30000 1000 1000 1000 0.0 1.0 1.0 -1 uniform 1.0 8 _mVar1.MATRIX.DOUBLE\r\n------CP createvar _mVar2 scratch_space//_p6710_127.0.1.1//_t0/temp2 true MATRIX binaryblock 1000 1000 1000 1000 -1 copy\r\n------CP ba+* _mVar0.MATRIX.DOUBLE _mVar1.MATRIX.DOUBLE _mVar2.MATRIX.DOUBLE 8\r\n------CP rmvar _mVar0\r\n------CP rmvar _mVar1\r\n------CP write _mVar2.MATRIX.DOUBLE Vout.SCALAR.STRING.true textcell.SCALAR.STRING.true .SCALAR.STRING.true\r\n------CP rmvar _mVar2\r\n\r\nSystemML Statistics:\r\nTotal elapsed time:\t\t4.649 sec.\r\nTotal compilation time:\t\t0.584 sec.\r\nTotal execution time:\t\t4.065 sec.\r\nNumber of compiled Spark inst:\t0.\r\nNumber of executed Spark inst:\t0.\r\nCache hits (Mem, WB, FS, HDFS):\t2/0/0/0.\r\nCache writes (WB, FS, HDFS):\t3/0/1.\r\nCache times (ACQr/m, RLS, EXP):\t0.000/0.001/0.001/0.438 sec.\r\nHOP DAGs recompiled (PRED, SB):\t0/0.\r\nHOP DAGs recompile time:\t0.000 sec.\r\nSpark ctx create time (lazy):\t0.000 sec.\r\nSpark trans counts (par,bc,col):0/0/0.\r\nSpark trans times (par,bc,col):\t0.000/0.000/0.000 secs.\r\nTotal JIT compile time:\t\t1.944 sec.\r\nTotal JVM GC count:\t\t6.\r\nTotal JVM GC time:\t\t0.054 sec.\r\nLibMatrixDNN dense count (conv/bwdF/bwdD/im2col/maxBwd):\t0/0/0/0/0.\r\nLibMatrixDNN sparse count (conv/bwdF/bwdD/im2col/maxBwd):\t0/0/0/0/0.\r\nLibMatrixDNN conv(im2col/matmult), bwdF (im2col/matmult), bwdD (col2im/matmult) time:\t0.000/0.000/0.000/0.000/0.000/0.000 sec.\r\nHeavy hitter instructions:\r\n #
