Is there anyone at NVidia who can take a look at this? It is important as a very common use case of these operations is batch mode processing with a lot of small matrices.

This will typically will be set at training time when the model is bind and the shapes infered from what the iterator provides as input data. This allows the same network to be trained with different batch sizes. \r\n\r\nFor the random noise, the shapes can be infered so there's no need to specify it. For example: \r\n```\r\ndata <- mx.symbol.Variable(\"data\")\r\nnoise <- mx.symbol.random_normal(loc=0, scale=1, name = \"noise\")\r\ndata_noise <- data + noise\r\ngraph.viz(data_noise, shape=c(2:3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo infer the shape for a given data input shape, you need to pass the required input shapes as a list: `data_noise$infer.shape(list(data=2:3))`. This provides the shapes of each arguments in the network. To get the output shapes of each operator, you can use: `data_noise$get.internals()$infer.shape(list(data=2:3))$out.shapes`\r\nOnly the data shape is required to get the shapes of the overall network. Other shapes for data can be specified: the same model could be reused if the batch size or number of input features were different. \r\n\r\nGraph can confirm: `graph.viz(data_noise, shape=c(2:3))`\r\n![rplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18605903/29787452-fd3e1510-8bfc-11e7-8a51-f064ead83b2f.png)\r\n\r\nYou can finally validate that the noise layer operates as expected and generates new random noise at each batch iteration:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nexec <- mxnet:::mx.symbol.bind(symbol = total, ctx = mx.cpu(), \r\n                               arg.arrays = list(data=data.array), aux.arrays = NULL,\r\n                               grad.reqs = c(\"null\"))\r\nmx.exec.forward(exec, is.train = T)\r\nexec$outputs\r\n```\r\n\r\n           [,1]       [,2]       [,3]\r\n[1,] -0.9185634 -0.7457144 -1.2080863\r\n[2,]  2.0088325  0.2863084  0.5604595\r\n\r\n```\r\nmx.exec.forward(exec, is.train = T)\r\nexec$outputs\r\n```\r\n          [,1]       [,2]      [,3]\r\n[1,] 1.8140212 -1.5227430 -2.515245\r\n[2,] 0.9697598 -0.5285375 -1.889090\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/325439440/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/325444580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7587#issuecomment-325444580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7587","id":325444580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTQ0NDU4MA==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T18:53:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T18:53:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@piiswrong ready for review.

Also, the filters are called learned filters, because the un-transposed version (filter) that we used to calculate the transposed filter learned the features during training.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/325703119/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/325734559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7613#issuecomment-325734559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7613","id":325734559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTczNDU1OQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-29T17:22:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T17:22:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please rebase to master","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/325734559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/325739639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7577#issuecomment-325739639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7577","id":325739639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTczOTYzOQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-29T17:40:58Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T17:40:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"still running out of heap size.

run mobilenet.py when setting num_group=num_filter and num_group=1 on GTX 1080ti on 1024 640x480 images with batch size=8 (total 128 batches) and compute average run-time. Using num_group=num_filter achieves 7.5 ms/fr vs. 10.9 ms/fr in case of num_group=1. Great !\r\nHowever, a version of ResNet-18 with grouping convolutions runs at 5.3 ms/fr vs  3.7 ms/fr of the original convolutions with num_group=1. Why is that?\r\nI used implementation of ResNet-18 from resnet.py as a baseline and modified it in the following ways\r\n1) I added 1x1 projections to the beginning of each of the residual blocks 2a, 3a, 4a and 5a prior to the first 3x3 convolutional layer to make the number of input channels and filters to be equal within each 3x3 block\r\n2) I set num_group = num_filter for each 3x3 convolutional layer starting from 2a.\r\nIn order to evaluate the effect of including additional 1x1 projections onto the total run-time I measured the run-time of the version where I add projections, but set num_group=1. Differences are negligible compared to using no 1x1 projections.\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nIs there smth specific about mobilenet that allows for a speed-up when using depth-wise factorized convolutions, which does not hold for ResNet-18?
