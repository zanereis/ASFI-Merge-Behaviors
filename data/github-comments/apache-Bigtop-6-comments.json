Need to add --experimental option when starting up docker daemon. I've added this on our build server slave06:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat /etc/sysconfig/docker\r\n# The max number of open files for the daemon itself, and all\r\n# running containers.  The default value of 1048576 mirrors the value\r\n# used by the systemd service unit.\r\nDAEMON_MAXFILES=1048576\r\n\r\n# Additional startup options for the Docker daemon, for example:\r\n# OPTIONS=\"--ip-forward=true --iptables=true\"\r\n# By default we limit the number of open files per container\r\nOPTIONS=\"--default-ulimit nofile=1024:4096 --experimental\"\r\n\r\n# How many seconds the sysvinit script waits for the pidfile to appear\r\n# when starting the daemon.\r\nDAEMON_PIDFILE_TIMEOUT=10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe built image: https://hub.docker.com/r/bigtop/prestosql-worker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/546624698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/547267258","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/546#issuecomment-547267258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/546","id":547267258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI2NzI1OA==","user":{"login":"youngwookim","id":699452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTQ1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/699452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim","html_url":"https://github.com/youngwookim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngwookim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T05:50:03Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T05:50:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @evans-ye \r\nI'll merge this patch to cnb branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/547267258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/547470863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/556#issuecomment-547470863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/556","id":547470863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzQ3MDg2Mw==","user":{"login":"jlosito","id":25142529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQyNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25142529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito","html_url":"https://github.com/jlosito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlosito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T15:12:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kwmonroe ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/547470863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
