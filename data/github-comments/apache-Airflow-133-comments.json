I have tested `slqpare` works for Oracle. Since this PR only covers Oracle operator for now, other operators can be added later very similarly through  follow-up PRs, confirming `sqlparse` works for other operators too.

is very interesting but I am wondering how would you support a typical approach for an Airflow installation which is having the DAG's directory as a clone of a git repository with all the DAGs. And retrieving any changes at some interval.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is the idea for most helm charts of an Airflow installation on K8s with an volume that does the syncing automatically (git-sync). Possibly this is in the recent k8s executor that has been merged (I haven't fully checked it out).\r\n\r\nThe UI should also offer then committing the change (if there is a git repo or similar) behind. Otherwise, this feature is only useful for less automatic deployments of Airflow.\r\n\r\nAlso I would consider the security part as it could open for attacks. Have you had a look at the RBAC implementation. It seems to be the way that the UI is heading and I think it fits nicely with your idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/383708292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/383711331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3251#issuecomment-383711331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3251","id":383711331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzcxMTMzMQ==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-23T20:27:00Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T20:27:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/383711331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/383711902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3251#issuecomment-383711902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3251","id":383711902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzcxMTkwMg==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-23T20:28:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T20:28:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is probably testable, just by instantiating a bare SubDagOperator and testing which executor is selected.
