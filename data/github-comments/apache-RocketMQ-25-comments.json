主要由``slaveReadEnable``这个参数控制。默认是关的``(slaveReadEnable = false bydefault）``。推荐把它打开，主从都要开。这个参数打开之后，在客户端消费数据时，会判断，当前读取消息的物理偏移量跟最新的位置的差值，是不是超过了内存容量的一个百分比``（accessMessageInMemoryMaxRatio= 40 by default）``。如果超过了，就会告诉客户端去备机上消费数据。如果采用异步主从，也就是brokerRole等于ASYNC_AMSTER的时候，你的备机IO打爆，其实影响不太大。但是如果你采用同步主从，那还是有影响。所以这个时候，最好挂两个备机。因为RocketMQ的主从同步复制，只要一个备机响应了确认写入就可以了，一台IO打爆，问题不大。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/441945099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/441957557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/562#issuecomment-441957557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/562","id":441957557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTk1NzU1Nw==","user":{"login":"ymwneu","id":8936633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzY2MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8936633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu","html_url":"https://github.com/ymwneu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymwneu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T07:37:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T07:37:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"由于broker资源固定，对broker来说，增加consumer消费理论上会对生产者TPS产生一定影响，但是根据实际的测试结果，这个影响应该是不大的。

@Liberxue 官方的benchmark测试也有消费者影响生产者TPS的情况。\r\n\r\n肯定会影响的；\r\n\r\n> 首先你是在同一个Topic做生产消费，我目前的解决方案是Master+Slave来做负载；其次 你在不同Topic生产消费TPS都会按Topic平均\r\n\r\n当Master和Slave都正常的情况下，默认从Master处读取消息，若开启了[slaveReadEnable](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/master/common/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/common/BrokerConfig.java#L111) ，且Master处积压了超过40%内存总量的未消费消息，那么会从Slave=1的Broker处读取消息。\r\n\r\n- 当Master宕机时，长时间未向Namesrv发送心跳，Namesrv清空下线的BrokerData，Consumer从Namesrv获取的TopicRouteData里已经没有了Master的BrokerData，因此Consumer从自身的brokerAddr集合里找不到Master的BrokerAddr了，因此就按顺序向第一位Slave发送消息拉取请求。\r\n\r\n- 默认配置下slaveReadEnable = false，因此Slave在从CommitLog读取到消息后，设置其suggest brokerId = 0 ,也就是建议其下次从Master处读取消息。\r\n\r\n- 在Master为恢复前，都是读取不到其brokerAddr的，因此每次都是从Slave处拉取消息，虽然其每次都建议Consumer从Master处读取。当Master恢复了，从新向Namesrv发送了心跳，注册了Broker信息。Consumer获取的最新TopicRouteData里包含了Master的brokerAddr，那么下次就会听从建议从Master处读取消息，从Slave切换回Master。\r\n\r\n建议你查看一下源码：\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/2b692c912d18c0f9889fd73358581bcccf37bbbe/broker/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/broker/processor/PullMessageProcessor.java\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/a220364b752669c474f9795884faed9bb4e0a8c1/broker/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/broker/BrokerController.java\r\n\r\n最后 我也希望能不影响 哈哈
