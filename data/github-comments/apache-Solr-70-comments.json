The [comment here](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2689#issuecomment-2329584805) gives me the impression that this has already come up and you've put some thought into it, but I'm having trouble digging up that context...)\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two known ways to set the base path URL:\r\n\r\n1. SolrRequest.setBasePath\r\n2. Recreate Http2SolrClient with the existing HttpClient and pass the base path URL.\r\n\r\n**Issues with the second approach:**\r\n\r\nInitially, we encountered authentication issues when recreating Http2SolrClient because the new instance was missing the appropriate listeners from the old client. This issue has been addressed in version 9.7, where recreating Http2SolrClient now also copies listeners along with properties like IdleTimeout, connectionTimeout, and others.\r\n\r\nThe second issue was avoiding unnecessary object creation. Also, if someone recreates it, they are responsible for closing the instance. Therefore, recreating `Http2SolrClient` just for the base URL is not recommended.\r\n\r\nHowever, since we've deprecated the first approach, I now favor the idea that when users need to set the base path, they should recreate Http2SolrClient and use a `try-with-resources` block to ensure proper closure.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry(Http2SolrClient solrClient = new Http2SolrClient.Builder(baseLeaderURL).build()) {\r\n    // code goes here\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to answer your question: Should this new method take a URL? Well, if we start taking a URL, we might need to recreate Http2SolrClient, for which the caller would then be responsible for closing. We could add an option where, if the user passes null, we don't create a new client and just return the existing Http2SolrClient. But that would introduce two responsibilities for this method â€” an anti-pattern.\r\n\r\nInstead, I would simply return the existing Http2SolrClient and let the user recreate it and set the base leader path in their own context, handling its lifecycle.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2374579550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2375060453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2689#issuecomment-2375060453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2689","id":2375060453,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6NkIvl","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-25T19:25:48Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T19:25:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All the approaches have downsides for sure, but for me personally, object allocation and the 'Closeable'-burden seem like the lesser evils.\r\n\r\n> unnecessary object creation\r\n\r\n\"Cloud\" clients are a bit different because of their ongoing ZK connections, but otherwise we've long assumed that our \"Http\" SolrClients are cheap and can/should be instantiated as-needed.  That assumption underlies a lot of other decisions in SolrJ - e.g. the push to [make client impl's immutable and remove their setters](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-8975).

And even for new devs, there's a lot of tooling built around enforcing this: IDEs will flag the unclosed Closeable, Solr's test-harness detects unclosed resources, etc.  Requiring users to close out the client is a non-zero burden - I'm not waving that away.  It's just a much smaller one IMO (and [\"less surprising\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)) than giving callers a client that they immediately need to clone or know a special incantation to actually use.\r\n\r\nNot going to -1 anything here - I'd hate to come in late and blow up your hard work.

This is useful for cases where required options are split intot two due to deprecation, made optional and checked later for presence explicitly, like in [ConfigTool.java](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2721/files#diff-4dc9e0c436824dac317a2023038313dacbb6cd6d5aa592cc8c3e06d071335a87):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nOption.builder(\"v\")\r\n    .longOpt(\"value\")\r\n    .deprecated(...)\r\n    .required(false)\r\n    //...\r\nOption.builder()\r\n    .longOpt(\"value\")\r\n    .required(false) // should be true when -v is removed.\r\n    //...\r\n\r\nString value = SolrCLI.getOptionWithDeprecatedAndDefault(cli, \"value\", \"v\", null);\r\n//...\r\nif (value == null) {\r\n    throw new MissingArgumentException(\"'value' is a required option.\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `OptionGroup`s in a wider range like you started in the other PR will probably render `SolrCLI#getOptionWithDeprecatedAndDefault(...)` obsolete.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2380631255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2380643974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2697#issuecomment-2380643974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2697","id":2380643974,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6N5b6G","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-28T13:40:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T13:40:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just a thought -- is this enum actually buying us anything at all?

Of course we have not exposed HttpClient but once we start using concrete classes reference, It started to evolve on their own. For instance, adding requesAsync was the first example, and now in the new PR we are adding another method `requestWithUrl`. As our codebase evolve we will start seeing more and more Http2SolrClient reference, and during that we will keep on adding more and more to `Http2SolrClient` only. \r\n\r\nYes; adding such method which throws `UnsupportedOpeartionException` is ugly. However, Lucene and our own codebase has good number of reference to UnsupportedOperationException. Even, Jdk uses it -- The collection framework, and lots of other places as well. \r\n\r\nBut it is either choosing between this, or adding more methods to the concrete classes.

It'd be right at home in other languages I think (Python, for instance), but cuts against expectation here IMO.\r\n\r\nThat said, I share @iamsanjay 's dislike for having the concrete type creeping into a lot of these usage locations.  Would a sub-class / sub-interface here be helpful?  e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface UrlOverrideableSolrClient {\r\n  ...\r\n  SolrResponse requestWithUrl(String, SolrRequest);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomething like the above would let users convey that they need \"one of those clients that supports alternate URLs\" without needing to specify the exact concrete type.

The large majority of `setBasePath` calls involve a Http2 client, but not all of them.  One or two places, most notably LBSolrClient, call `setBasePath` even when a HttpSolrClient is used.\r\n\r\nThere are a few workarounds available that are only slightly hacky, so it's not the end of the world.  And maybe the Apache clients are going away for 10.0 anyway and this is 100% moot - not sure where that effort stands?

I just added you to my epugh:solr repo, hopefully I did it right!\r\n\r\nMy head is thinking that OptionGroups, and using the explicit objects instead of strings is the way to go.  In terms of timing, I'm sort of thinking that maybe this all goes in 10 (`main`) only.   I'm really looking forward to getting rid of all the deprecated code, which will simplify a lot of the complex logic on params, simplify our testing, and open the door to more refactorings like embracing OptionGroups.    WDYT?   I don't believe 10 will be that far off anyway, so if `main` and `branch_9x` diverage a bit, that is okay.  Maybe we open a draft PR for OptionGroup in 10, and push hard to finish the conflicting params work that is in 10 and 9, and then finish off the OptionGroup work?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2393427127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2393898243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2725#issuecomment-2393898243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2725","id":2393898243,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Or_0D","user":{"login":"malliaridis","id":33470669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDcwNjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33470669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis","html_url":"https://github.com/malliaridis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malliaridis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-04T14:54:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T14:54:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> My head is thinking that OptionGroups, and using the explicit objects instead of strings is the way to go.\r\n\r\nI agree.
