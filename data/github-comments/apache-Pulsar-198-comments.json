We maintain a library (say, _avro-schemas_) that contains all .avsc files and their generated .class files. Lets say we are on version v1 of this library on producer as well as consumer applications. This works fine.\r\n2. We add a new field (with defaults) to avro in _avro-schemas_, update our library to v2 and update this in the producer application.\r\n3. Consumer application is still using v1 of the _avro-schemas_ library.\r\n4. The apache avro library looks for a class name with the name of schema in the class loader context. In our case, it finds the old class in v1.\r\n5. Now [it goes through every field in schema](https://github.com/apache/avro/blob/8199b9626e4badd34a85946cd223a91863f44cee/lang/java/avro/src/main/java/org/apache/avro/generic/GenericDatumReader.java#L235) (updated schema), fetches that from binary data buffer and tries to set that in my old class.

I could be an improvement in the `ProducerImpl`, where `client.scheduledExecutorService().scheduleAtFixedRate` better reflects what you want to achieve than using a `Timeout`. Also, the `keyGeneratorTask` could use the `ScheduledExecutorService` instead of using the Netty eventLoopGroup. On the other hand, if you are producing messages for a huge number of topics (10k +), the `HashedWheelTimer` may perform better.

I feel that you are mixing resources with verbs and generating a lot of \"unneeded\" operations.\r\n\r\nFor example,  each policy rule in a namespace policy should be treated as a resource. The operations to a given policy rule are `write` and `read`. So when you introduce a new policy rule, you don't need to introduce a new verb. Also, I don't think enum is a good way to allow extensibility. I think we can use a `string` for representing different policy rules within a namespace policy. \r\n\r\nKubernetes' API machinery provides a good example of this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@joefk \r\n\r\nI think the pull request here is to allow people to define their own authorization implementation since some organizations have the need to integrate Pulsar into its owner authentication/authorization system to control those resources. The purpose of this pull request is different from PIP-49. We attempt to improve the current authorization model. This pull request should NOT change our current authorization model as the concerns have been raised when discussing
