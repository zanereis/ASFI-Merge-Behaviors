But for some reason, the default setup of docfx doesn't understand that very well. They apparently made some changes to the way metadata is handled that are not compatible with our config that worked on the old version. But it was never great - in the old version links between subsites wouldn't resolve, so I had to hard code them. Now it seems that links are going to the wrong subsite so they have to be hard coded or painstakingly researched.\r\n\r\nAs sad as it is, hard coding is a solution until we have time to get into the issues with why it fails to resolve many links most of the time. At least now it is spitting out warnings about all of the hard coded URLs so we can easily see what to fix later, so I guess that is an improvement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2405416576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2406196704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/961#issuecomment-2406196704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/961","id":2406196704,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6Pa6Xg","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-10T23:12:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T23:12:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":":warning: **IMPORTANT:** This PR may contain changes to dependency versions.

The problem is, Lucene requires super fast access to the its files. Lucene is entirely file based and sure, there's APIs to have a different Directory store, but ultimately if Lucene is not operating off of a fast disk, it will be very slow. The work around for this, is to sync the indexes so that Lucene operates off of a local files system (maybe in %temp%) and the Lucene Replicator is used to sync to a slow storage system so that when the process restarts, a sync from the slow system to the fast drive works.\r\n\r\nI have implemented this for slow network drives to fast local drives https://github.com/Shazwazza/Examine/blob/support/3.x/src/Examine.Lucene/Directories/SyncedFileSystemDirectoryFactory.cs\r\n\r\nI used to try to manage the implementation for Blog Storage but that was abandoned.

The fact that a link or mention of it was missing from both the issue and PR was the primary thing holding this up.\r\n\r\nI see a few issues that should be addressed before merging it.\r\n\r\n- [x] 1. The production change is missing a `LUCENENET` comment indicating where the change (which diverges from 4.8.0) came from. Ideally, there would be a link back to the PR or commit where the code was ported from.\r\n- [x] 2. The name of the test method should be Pascal case. NUnit doesn't automatically detect test methods based on a naming convention, so there is no need to stick with that casing in .NET.\r\n- [x] 3. The test method and `GetCommitData()` method are not in the same order in the file as they were in Lucene. In Lucene, `TestVariableSchema()` (the following test in this PR) is on [line 593](https://github.com/Shibi-bala/lucene/blob/e98cc333e2131ca9d39f81a2da9fed5ab0d1d5bb/lucene/core/src/test/org/apache/lucene/index/TestIndexWriter.java#L593) and `TestGetCommitDataFromOldSnapshot()` is on [line 2064](https://github.com/Shibi-bala/lucene/blob/e98cc333e2131ca9d39f81a2da9fed5ab0d1d5bb/lucene/core/src/test/org/apache/lucene/index/TestIndexWriter.java#L2064).\r\n- [x] 4. The original test used `getLiveCommitData()`, not `getCommitData()`. It's fine if `setLiveCommitData()` doesn't exist in 4.8.0, but we should `LUCENENET` comment to make it clear why we diverged (and that it has diverged) on each of the lines that call `GetCommitData()` and `SetCommitData()`, since these will need to be changed back when we upgrade.\r\n- [x] 5. The original test used [`newSnapshotIndexWriterConfig(null)`](https://github.com/Shibi-bala/lucene/blob/e98cc333e2131ca9d39f81a2da9fed5ab0d1d5bb/lucene/test-framework/src/java/org/apache/lucene/tests/util/LuceneTestCase.java#L935-L940). We should port that method in `LuceneTestCase` rather than inlining the configuration, and add a `LUCENENET` comment indicating where the diverging method came from.\r\n- [x] 6. The `TestGetCommitDataFromOldSnapshot()` and `GetCommitData()` methods also don't have a `LUCENENET` comment indicating where these diverging changes came from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2428428333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2428815714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/793#issuecomment-2428815714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/793","id":2428815714,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6QxMli","user":{"login":"sgf","id":2557696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTc2OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2557696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf","html_url":"https://github.com/sgf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-22T09:49:38Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T09:50:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> In all of this, one thing you should keep in mind is that many people (even Microsoft!) currently use portions of Lucene 4.8 in production.

However, I understand and sympathize with the sentiment of the rest of your message. Those of us that are actively working on this project are currently giving it all we can to get this done.\r\n\r\nTo provide an update which is due anyways, we are nearly done with preparing the next release. The ICU4N and J2N releases to support .NET 8 and satellite assemblies are done and dependencies upgraded, so that we can now target .NET 8, which is PR #928 that was just merged today. This should hopefully be the last _major_ item for the beta 17 release. We are reviewing now to see if there are any remaining issues that need to be included. This will be our first beta release in a couple years and we're eager to get it done, but we also want to get any breaking changes out of the way all at once.\r\n\r\nAfter the beta 17 release, my personal goal is to help us get to a final \"RTM\" release of 4.8 this calendar year if at all possible. We'll need the community's help in testing the beta 17 release to make sure it's solid. This means not only filing bugs, but letting us know in the affirmative that it's working well for your workload so that we can have some confirmation of our work and how it is being used. Please **do not** jump in to port post-4.8 features at this time; any PRs for these will likely be closed and your efforts might be wasted. Likewise, we apologize but we are not accepting significant architectural changes (library structure, .NET version, C# language features, etc.) at this time. We can't have this be a moving goalpost; we need to focus on getting the release done.\r\n\r\nStay tuned, we're pushing hard, and we'll hopefully have a beta 17 release ready for testing very, very soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2429568279/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":7,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2430215736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/963#issuecomment-2430215736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/963","id":2430215736,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6Q2iY4","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-22T20:37:20Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T20:37:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Shoot, I did a bad merge.

Lucene.NET 4 even in beta is used in countless production apps and websites but also know Lucene itself is a pretty low level beast. To implement it correctly depending on your requirements needs a lot of knowledge... i.e elasticsearch, azuresearch, solr, examine, etc. \nThis tiny team has made advanced embedded search possible for so many applications but once this release is made (an enormous amount of work), getting more on par with Java release is hopefully so much easier. \nIf you want distributed systems...

But the world is essentially competitive. If you are behind, you will lose your share, and your users will be reduced, and the development progress will be slow, forming a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nYou are right. The numbers don't lie. It is a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nTime for a quick math lesson. Take a seat.\r\n\r\nI worked 7 days this week for 12 hours each day. How many days are in a week? 7 days. Quick math - how many more days can I work in a week? That is right, 0.\r\n\r\nLucene.NET has over 450,000 lines of code. It depends on functionality that doesn't exist in the BCL. All together, we are maintaining over 600,000 lines of code including those dependencies. This is not simple code. It goes deep into dozens of different technologies. Most of these things I have never had to deal with in over 20 years of programming. And the way things are done in Java simply don't translate well to .NET in a multitude of ways. All that we have left are the gaps at the edges of the application, but there are some very big gaps.\r\n\r\nNow, how many people regularly contribute to Lucene.NET? 4 or 5? Yeah, that is about right. But look closer. How many are contributing to the *code*? Currently, only 2. Most of the time it is 1. \r\n\r\nQuick math. What is 600,000 divided by 2? How about divided by 1? Do you see the problem now?\r\n\r\nEver write a randomized test framework that is capable of repeating the random scenario so the test fails reliably with the same seed? Ever package an app with satellite assemblies representing over 750 languages? Ever implement the part of Unicode that .NET doesn't support? Ever copy a formatter out of the BCL just so you can add functionality to it because Microsoft didn't make it extensible and we need that feature? How about writing code that can put a ref struct or an interface into the same variable without any boxing? Probably not. How long do you think it would take you? Now how about if you multiply it by 30 things you have never worked with before?\r\n\r\nI have over 6,000 hours of my time invested in this project and its dependencies, and that is being conservative. I have worked with more diverse technologies in the past 3 years than most people will ever touch in their entire career. Paul Irwin returned recently to ensure the hard work that he invested in this project over a decade ago will be released. He is doing his part, and is invaluable to the project. What was your contribution? One complaint? Make that two.\r\n\r\nDo you seriously think a complaint is going to make us go faster? Do you think we have time to consider that you are being clobbered by your competition because you decided to sit back and wait instead of jump in and help? We don't spend one second thinking about this. We are *completely overwhelmed* by the amount of work there is left to do. It is *beyond absurd* to expect us to find extra time to include anything that isn't already in Lucene or isn't something directly related to closing a gap.\r\n\r\nThe project isn't being delayed. It is going as fast as we can go. But there is only so much a couple of people working on the code can achieve when it comes to the release. The people working on the website and helping keep up with the revolving door of target frameworks are also important. They are at least doing their part to lighten the load.\r\n\r\nAs for \"losing shares\", here are some real numbers:\r\n\r\n- In 2016, we got about 600 downloads per day.\r\n- In 2024, we are getting about 7000 downloads per day.\r\n\r\nSo, we are not losing shares. It is you who is losing. You depend on a stable release. But you don't care enough to help get it done. The decision to wait instead of help was entirely yours, and you are losing because you made the wrong decision.\r\n\r\nLucene.NET is not stable. The API has planned breaking changes that are not even started yet.\r\n\r\n- The analyzer calls dispose and then expects the class to still be functional, so we are planning to change it to use a `Close()` method instead so `Dispose(true)` can be used to do a final cleanup.\r\n-  There is code that was generated in Java that has been hand-ported in .NET. That is the quickest way, but isn't going to be maintainable in the long term. Changing public APIs to be generated in a way that is more sensible in .NET will almost certainly introduce breaking changes in both the API and behavior.\r\n\r\nThere is more than this, but my point is that we have breaking changes planned and we only get one shot at the version number 4.8.0. The next version number we will use is 4.8.0.1 because version 4.8.1 implies that we have ported Lucene 4.8.1. This doesn't leave much room for breaking APIs since nobody expects 4.8.0.1 to be a breaking change from 4.8.0. I have some ideas on how to work around this for obscure APIs, but for the primary ones, breaking binary changes are not acceptable for a stable release.\r\n\r\nWe *just* fixed the last known concurrency bug in the Lucene.Net core module, which will be fixed in 4.8.0-beta00017. We also put in some low level native API calls to implement the fsync functionality that we were missing. But we recently found and ported a missing test that revealed that our [ACID support is broken](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/894). About 1 power outage out of 200 during a commit will result in a corrupted index. Does that sound stable to you? This is database 101 kind of stuff, and we are not there yet. I am out of my depth with this problem and we could use someone who is familiar with the implementation of database fault tolerance and durability (or someone willing to learn) to step in and help.\r\n\r\nThe vicious circle is that for companies who require a stable release, every year that passes by they are losing out by not helping or funding us so we can get more help. We need players on the field to pass the ball to or we cannot move any faster.\r\n\r\nThe Lucene.NET project is not letting the Lucene.NET community down. But the Lucene.NET community is letting the Lucene.NET project down by not helping or providing funding to get it done. We have an entire plan in place to catch up with Lucene's release schedule. But we will never hit a moving target with this many lines of code and so few people. It would be absurd to even try it.\r\n\r\nSo, now the ball is in your court. And by you, I am referring to the entire Lucene.NET community reading this. If you want a stable Lucene.NET release, you have 3 options:\r\n\r\n1. Help\r\n2. Fund - contact me through the email on my GitHub profile if you would rather fund the project as a whole than one developer\r\n3. Wait\r\n\r\nThe action you take next will demonstrate just how serious you are about wanting a stable Lucene.NET release. **You have much more power to change the release date than I do.**\r\n\r\nThere is a push to try to get the production release out before the end of the year. I don't think it can be done with only 2 people working on the 4.8.0 blockers even if we take as many shortcuts as we can. But with a few more people working on the blockers and helping to drive ICU4N to a stable (but incomplete) state, I think it is plausible.\r\n\r\nNow for one last bit of math. Looking at my watch, it has been 4 hours since I started typing this. So did your complaint-as-a-contribution to Lucene.NET shorten or lengthen the time it will take us to release? That's right, you have just delayed the release by half a day by prompting me to reply. It took me away from other tasks I was doing. I am sure the Lucene.NET community as a whole really appreciates your contribution. But don't worry, you can submit a PR for a blocker to put us back on track again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2439666039/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2440838432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/793#issuecomment-2440838432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/793","id":2440838432,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6RfD0g","user":{"login":"jeme","id":1609615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk2MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme","html_url":"https://github.com/jeme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-28T08:18:58Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T08:18:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should we close and lock this topic?\r\nIt's a question, I think it has been answered and there hasn't really been any actionable input here IMO.

The short answer to the original question is \"when it's done.\" The longer answer is explained above. We are currently actively in the middle of releasing beta 17 within the next couple days, then there will be a beta 18 release, and then if all goes well, that might be the last beta before a final release (possibly with a RC in there? idk). Depending on how fast our active contributors (myself included) can finish this work up, and based on how many contributions we get from the community for the 4.8 open items (see the 4.8.0-beta00018 and 4.8.0 milestones), that will determine how long it takes to wrap this release up. My goal of by the end of this calendar year is looking unlikely for the final release, but I'm certainly going to push to have beta 18 done by then.\r\n\r\nAnd I know the remaining work is not the \"fun stuff.\" It's chasing down failing tests and reviewing assertions and fixing satellite assemblies and documentation and whatnot. Yep, that's what we're going through now. But it's the long tail of \"boring\" work to finish up a stable release. \r\n\r\nAgain, please do not submit PRs for any post-4.8 features at this time, otherwise it might be a while before it can be merged, it will go stale or have merge conflicts, and just be a burden to keep open. Although we might accept small, isolated bugfixes that are backported from post-4.8 versions iff they don't change the public API, include all tests, include comments explaining the backport, etc. If you have any questions and want to ensure you're not wasting effort, please file an issue for the backport with a link to the original Java project commit/PR, and ask us if we would accept the fix for the 4.8 release. If all looks good we'll give you any feedback or the greenlight to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to contribute now, we desperately need help with the remaining items in those two 4.8.0-beta00018 and 4.8.0 milestones above all else.

To augment/update the original two possibilities in the original issue from 2019 with some other ideas (items 3+ below):\r\n\r\n1. ~~Find a similar tool to javacc in .NET that supports similar options that were used in javacc, and create a converter tool to change the javacc configuration into a configuration that the .NET tool supports.~~ This does not seem to exist, as far as I can tell.\r\n2. ~~Do a direct port of javacc to C#, and fix its logic to use a more efficient control flow mechanism than exceptions (perhaps goto would be the most direct replacement).~~ While possible, this is quite a large undertaking, as javacc even builds its own parser itself. I do not think this amount of effort is worth it, especially given that the queryparser jj files have only seen a few minor updates in the last 10ish years.\r\n3. Convert the javacc syntax to ANTLRv4, like I did with Expressions.JS in #996. This is a significant undertaking though, as javacc syntax is not directly comparable to ANTLR. It's also fairly risky, as there might be subtle incompatibilities in the parsing that are not caught by our tests. It also has the potential for having worse performance (or better performance, who knows) - but we won't know until the work is done. And then it would be a divergent syntax that would be difficult to port future fixes to.\r\n4. An idea I had last night is that I could add a build task library to my [JavaToCSharp project](https://github.com/paulirwin/JavaToCSharp), and instead of trying to automate building the jj file (or porting to ANTLR), we could automate converting the generated Java code from Lucene into C#, treating Java as an intermediate language for this purpose. I tested that the 4.8 generated QueryParser.java file converts successfully, although it has a few warnings I'd need to look into. If we could automate this as part of the build via a msbuild task (like the Antlr4BuildTasks project), that could be a good middle ground. I'll spend a few mental cycles on seeing if this is feasible and worth doing. One possible downside of this is we'd lose possible opportunity for optimizations of the code, unless someone wants to contribute the ability to add rewriting plugins to JavaToCSharp.\r\n5. Leave it as-is and keep porting the generated code by hand (or converting one-off as needed with JavaToCSharp).\r\n\r\nAt this point, I don't know if it makes sense to try to attempt this for 4.8, and that porting work is already done. I think we can revisit this for the next post-4.8 release, so I'm moving this back to the Future milestone for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2444453566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2444499422","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/268#issuecomment-2444499422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/268","id":2444499422,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6RtBne","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-29T14:52:27Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T14:56:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">At this point, I don't know if it makes sense to try to attempt this for 4.8, and that porting work is already done.

We had that, but I ripped out the NLS error message resources long time ago.

And I wish that were \"easier,\" but see my comment above. None of these automated approaches are particularly easy. The generated files are only ~750 lines of Java each, compared to how many thousands of lines and hours of porting javacc, or having ANTLR syntax that does not match upstream, or having to add rewriting and build task support to JavaToCSharp. javacc is not a trivial syntax to implement a generator for, unfortunately. I could envision easily spending hundreds of hours on this problem, just to save myself one or two fewer orders of magnitude by just updating the generated code by hand (including even getting it up to date as of 10.0 for the next release). This is compounded by the chicken-and-egg problem of needing to know what our desired generated code would look like with those exception and i18n changes you mention above, before we know how to write a generator for it, at which point we might as well hand-port the first version of that anyways, regardless of if we automate it or not.\r\n\r\nOf note, the Lucene team commits their generated Java code to the repo, so it will be easy to do diffs to see what changed, if we want to continue to hand-port it in the future.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to update the generated code manually to factor in the requested changes above, I think we can split that off as its own issue, since that would be separate from \"Automate Generation of QueryParser to C#.\" And that seems like a reasonable thing to include in 4.8.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2444578730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2444667588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/268#issuecomment-2444667588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/268","id":2444667588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6RtqrE","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-29T15:46:41Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T15:46:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The requested changes weren't part of the generated code, so we are talking about 2 different things.

As long as we keep doing things the wrong way and throwing the exception, there is not much point in doing the localization because the user has the chance to intervene (since they are forced to catch an exception anyway).

Indeed these sound like 2 good places to start.\r\n\r\nI looked at `ThreadAbortException` a bit. We don't catch it directly, but it subclasses `SystemException`. This corresponds roughly to `RuntimeException` in Java. There are only a few cases where we use the `.IsRuntimeException()` extension method in the core assembly, and in all of those cases we are rethrowing the exception. So this does not seem likely to be the problem.\r\n\r\nI checked with ChatGPT to get some high-level analysis about how Lucene 4.8.0 manages transactional behavior:\r\n\r\n> Apache Lucene 4.8.0 uses a combination of write-ahead logging and checkpointing, implemented through its own data structures and mechanisms rather than traditional database methods, to maintain consistency and ensure durability in the event of a crash.\r\n>\r\n>Here’s how Lucene 4.8.0 specifically achieves this:\r\n>\r\n>**Segment-Based Architecture:** Lucene writes data in immutable segments, which helps it maintain consistency. Each time data is added, modified, or deleted, Lucene creates a new segment rather than modifying existing ones. This approach minimizes the risk of data corruption since it doesn’t overwrite existing data but rather appends new changes.\r\n>\r\n>**Commit Points:** Lucene uses commit points to mark stable, consistent snapshots of the index. During indexing, changes are stored in memory and periodically flushed to disk as new segments. When a commit is requested, Lucene creates a commit point by writing a new segments_N file, which serves as a reference to the current state of the index. The segments_N file acts as a checkpoint that points to the set of segments that make up a consistent view of the index.\r\n>\r\n>**Write-Ahead Log (WAL) with Transaction Log File:** For any changes made to the index, Lucene uses a transaction log file to record pending changes before they are committed. This file logs operations that are in progress, providing a record in case of a crash. Upon restart, Lucene can check this transaction log to replay any operations that were interrupted and restore the index to a consistent state.\r\n>\r\n>**Two-Phase Commit (Optional):** While Lucene 4.8.0 does not use a full distributed two-phase commit protocol, it does have an optional two-phase commit feature for situations where multiple processes might be writing to the index concurrently (e.g., when using a directory like NFS). In such cases, this feature can help coordinate commits across multiple nodes to prevent partial writes.\r\n>\r\n>**Crash Recovery:** If there’s a sudden failure, Lucene relies on the segments_N file to determine the last consistent commit point. Since Lucene only updates the segments_N file after writing all necessary data to disk, the system can revert to the last valid snapshot by loading the most recent segments_N file.\r\n>\r\n>Through these approaches, Lucene 4.8.0 achieves consistency by committing data in a safe manner and relying on immutable segment files and a clear commit structure, which protect the index from corruption even in case of power loss or unexpected crashes.\r\n\r\nI then went a little bit further to try to get some clues as to specifically what is failing. It gave us a few things we can experiment with to determine if they help to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n> > We ported the transaction code in Lucene.NET 4.8.0. It is behaving correctly on .NET Framework (that is, the TestIndexWriterOnJRECrash test is passing). However, on .NET Core we sometimes get a failure during a simulated power outage. What difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core is likely to be causing this?\r\n\r\n>ChatGPT said:\r\n>\r\n>If Lucene.NET 4.8.0's TestIndexWriterOnJRECrash test is failing on .NET Core but not on .NET Framework, this might stem from differences in file handling and caching behaviors between the two runtimes, especially regarding how they handle file system flushes and durability guarantees.\r\n>\r\n>Here are some likely causes:\r\n>\r\n>**File System Flushing and Durability Guarantees:**\r\n>\r\n>.NET Framework and .NET Core differ in how they handle file system writes, particularly around ensuring data is flushed to disk. In .NET Framework, file writes may be more aggressive in flushing data to disk when using FileStream.Flush(true) (with true forcing a flush to disk). However, .NET Core on certain platforms, particularly on Linux, might treat flushes differently, not always ensuring data reaches persistent storage immediately.\r\nLucene relies on calling fsync (or Flush(true)) to ensure that all data is written to disk before committing the segments_N file. However, on .NET Core, especially on non-Windows platforms, there may be differences in how this flush is handled by the OS, potentially causing unflushed data to remain in memory when a crash is simulated.\r\n>\r\n> **File Locking Behavior Differences:**\r\n>\r\n>Lucene’s commit process relies on exclusive file locks to protect the segments_N file and other index files during updates. .NET Core and .NET Framework have some differences in file locking implementations and behaviors, especially when running on Linux. On Linux, .NET Core uses advisory locking rather than mandatory locking, which might not always prevent other processes or threads from accessing the file.\r\n>\r\n> **Platform-Specific File Caching:**\r\n>\r\n>.NET Core, especially on non-Windows platforms, may defer certain file operations to in-memory cache layers longer than .NET Framework does, potentially leading to timing issues in crash simulation tests. If the simulated crash occurs before the OS writes the data from cache to disk, the index could be left in an inconsistent state.\r\n>\r\n> **Differences in FileOptions.WriteThrough:**\r\n>\r\n>On .NET Core, FileOptions.WriteThrough can be specified for file operations to bypass OS caches and write directly to disk. However, this behavior is more consistent on Windows than on other platforms, where it might not have the same impact. Using FileOptions.WriteThrough could potentially improve durability on .NET Core by ensuring data reaches disk more reliably.\r\n>\r\n> ### Potential Fixes\r\n>\r\n> To improve consistency in this crash simulation test, try the following adjustments:\r\n>\r\n>**Explicit Flush and File Sync**: Ensure that FileStream.Flush(true) is used for every critical file operation and commit phase in Lucene.NET on .NET Core, as this may improve data durability.\r\n>\r\n>**Use `FileOptions.WriteThrough`**: If running on .NET Core and supported by the environment, open file streams with FileOptions.WriteThrough to minimize caching issues and enforce writes directly to disk.\r\n>\r\n>**Platform-Specific Configuration**: If these changes do not stabilize the test, it may be necessary to adjust Lucene.NET’s file handling configuration based on platform detection (e.g., applying extra flushes or locks on .NET Core for Linux vs. Windows).\r\nBy accounting for these differences in file handling between .NET Framework and .NET Core, especially around data flushing and durability, you can improve the reliability of the simulated crash tests on both platforms.\r\n\r\n`FileStream.Flush(true)` was the thing that was killing performance on .NET 8.0, which is why we put the fsync call out of band like it was in Java, so it isn't likely to be the cause. However, it wouldn't hurt to review when we are calling `Flush()` to make sure it is happening everywhere it should be.\r\n\r\n`FileOptions.WriteThrough` seems like something we should investigate. In fact, it might not hurt to review all of the options that we are passing to `FileStream` instances, since this differs so greatly from Java.\r\n\r\nUsing OS-level disk monitoring might also help to narrow down the problem, but it does seem like it might be a shortcut to try these other suggestions first.\r\n\r\nWould you like to give it a shot to see whether one of these suggestions fixes the test?\r\n\r\n> Wow - ChatGPT makes this analysis work so much easier!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2446038727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2446161936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/793#issuecomment-2446161936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/793","id":2446161936,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6RzXgQ","user":{"login":"turowicz","id":1055391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1055391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz","html_url":"https://github.com/turowicz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-30T08:24:25Z","updated_at":"2024-10-30T08:24:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"testing testing 1-2-3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2446161936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2447803578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/1004#issuecomment-2447803578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/1004","id":2447803578,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6R5oS6","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-30T16:55:12Z","updated_at":"2024-10-30T16:55:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A few subtle corrections:\r\n\r\n> 1.

So, it took a while to work out that I needed to use `dotnet tool install` instead.\r\n\r\nThere are a few problems with this approach:\r\n\r\n1. It isn't clear where the tool is being physically installed on the machine and whether it is being done in a custom way in a virtual environment.\r\n2. GitHub Actions does not use the system path, it uses a [text file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-system-path). If `dotnet tool` updates the system path, it has no effect in the virtual environment.\r\n3. Since it isn't clear where the tool is, we have to search for it by outputting the files in the log.\r\n4.

But that wasn't clear.\r\n\r\nIt is simpler to understand if the path is *inside* of our repo directory than to have it install it in some magic directory on the machine. We don't have to worry about whether the current CI environment knows where the tool is, because we know. It is very clear by looking at the script where the tool is.

If we use a versioned local folder to store the tool locally, we could just check for the existence of the version folder. If it is there, run it. If not, create the folder and install it using `dotnet tool install` with `--tool-path`. The tool would never be out of date.

I think our best path is going to be adding `IEnumerable<T>` here in a non-breaking way, rather than trying to change the existing implementation. That way, anyone that wants to enumerate over it may do so, but the existing methods are not affected.\r\n\r\nA quick implementation on DocIdSetIterator might look like:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic IEnumerator<int> GetEnumerator() => new DocIdSetEnumerator(this);\r\n\r\nIEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => GetEnumerator();\r\n\r\nprivate class DocIdSetEnumerator : IEnumerator<int>\r\n{\r\n    private readonly DocIdSetIterator outerInstance;\r\n    private int current;\r\n\r\n    public DocIdSetEnumerator(DocIdSetIterator outerInstance)\r\n    {\r\n        this.outerInstance = outerInstance;\r\n        current = -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int Current => current;\r\n\r\n    object IEnumerator.Current => current;\r\n\r\n    public void Dispose()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public bool MoveNext()\r\n    {\r\n        current = outerInstance.NextDoc();\r\n\r\n        return current != NO_MORE_DOCS;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void Reset()\r\n    {\r\n        throw new System.NotSupportedException();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, all subclasses will automatically inherit this behavior.\r\n\r\nIf that design sounds good, I can get a PR for that.\r\n\r\n## CharArrayIterator \r\n\r\nI believe this type is what was referred to as `CharacterIterator` in @NightOwl888's last post from 2020, but let me know if I'm wrong. This type supports bidirectional iteration, and I think there is a nice symmetry currently with `Next` and `Previous`. I don't think it's a good idea for us to change this to support `IEnumerable<char>`, although again I could see adding an implementation similar to the one above for DocIdSetIterator that just calls `Next` on the CharArrayIterator.\r\n\r\n## BreakIterator\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this is referring to BreakIterator in ICU4N, in which case that should be an issue there, although similarly to CharArrayIterator, it has a nice bidirectional symmetry currently. I think we should keep its existing design, and just consider adding `IEnumerable<int>` to it in a non-breaking way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2455506582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2455626799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/279#issuecomment-2455626799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/279","id":2455626799,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6SXeQv","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-04T20:21:36Z","updated_at":"2024-11-04T20:21:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## DocIdSetIterator\r\n\r\nI tried to convert this a while back and I pretty much came to the conclusion it is better the way that it is. The main issue was the `DocsAndPositionsEnum` which seemed to be able to switch between enumerating docs and enumerating positions (although I found no such switching anywhere in the code, so maybe that is an invalid assumption.\r\n\r\n## CharArrayIterator\r\n\r\nThis technically has no purpose in .NET. They were used in Java to potentially fix bugs in BreakIterators in broken JREs. There is at least 1 other implementation of `CharacterIterator` that is also completely useless in .NET.\r\n\r\n## BreakIterator\r\n\r\nTechnically, `BreakIterator` was an interface in the JDK and the design in ICU4J is an \"improved\" design that does not subclass it. In .NET, we merged them into one thing because the BCL is missing anything like `BreakIterator`.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the design needs rework to be compatible with `ReadOnlySpan<char>` because `CharacterIterator` wraps the `chars[]` and `BreakIterator` wraps `CharacterIterator`. My thought is to add a seam so the rules engine can be used without the rest of the design and then it would be possible to create a `ValueBreakIterator` ref struct. But it is tricky because the purpose of the `CharacterIterator` piece is to allow input as `UTF-8` without changing the rest of the design and working out a way to make a more optimized design extensible requires some thought. Ideally, `CharacterIterator` would be eliminated completely.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that does mean it is not related to this project.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at the commit history, it looks like there was some work on this earlier this year (May 7) that is still on one of my branches. I don't know whether that work has been merged yet.

this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2455626799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2457433147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/996#issuecomment-2457433147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/996","id":2457433147,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6SeXQ7","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-05T15:11:47Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T15:11:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888
