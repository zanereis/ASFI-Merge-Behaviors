have been a typo in the class name (an error in the configuration) causing ClassNotFoundException, \r\n\r\nFrom my testing, ClassNotFoundException was handled correctly. At least in the shell. \r\n\r\n> To me, the hanging shell is not as important as being able to load other tables during a recovery if they are otherwise configured correctly. It maybe a solution solves both, but recovery will often happen unattended and may not be recognized immediate until other things start to misbehave. If you are in the shell and it hangs you'll likely notice and can act accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe shell hanging was only on the initial part. The latter parts you mentioned, about recovery, does appear to happen as well after things get into a bad state. I will try to recreate the issue without relying on the minor compaction. The shell hanging was a byproduct of compactions retrying until canceled. The solution to that can be unrelated but if we make a limit to the number of retries before automatically cancelling (or delaying until everything else loads in) then that could solve both. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Turns out, the flush part wasn't needed.
