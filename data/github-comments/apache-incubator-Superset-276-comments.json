If I understand what you've done, you're doing something pretty clever with the filter box, for which it hasn't really been designed. Or rather, the problem isn't so much the filter box itself, but the fact that the `filter_values` function you're calling is referencing columns that are not available in your datasource. I think it might be possible to leave any columns that aren't present in the datasource from the additional filters generated by the function. Let me think about this for a second.\r\n\r\nUltimately though, I think you're actually looking for something similar to what's discussed in #8452 , i.e. a component that makes it possible to define more fine grained filtering than is currently offered by existing components.

My recommendation would be to go with the `changed_on` timestamp instead of the `sql` column. As you mention, Datasources define a number of different things that could affect cache behavior or results. Causing cache misses on every Datasource update feels more future-proof, as this logic won't need to change every time Datasource behavior changes. We may cause some unnecessary cache misses, but I think we should lean in the direction of ensuring correctness first and thinking about performance second.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/569827644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/569872496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7804#issuecomment-569872496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7804","id":569872496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTg3MjQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"anandhurajan","id":37609611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjA5NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37609611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan","html_url":"https://github.com/anandhurajan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandhurajan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T06:21:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T06:21:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi All,\r\nAny update on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/569872496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/569874379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8733#issuecomment-569874379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8733","id":569874379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTg3NDM3OQ==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T06:37:43Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T06:37:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch @willbarrett I propose merging this;

Personally I would love for `black` to be opinionated with regards to imports which would remove the need to use `isort`. \r\n \r\nAs @mistercrunch mentioned `pylint` is dynamic and provides functionality that `flake8` never could. I sense that `black` + `isort` + `mypy` + `pylint` is a superset of `flake8` hence why `flake8` was removed. `pylint` has its detractors and at times it feels somewhat dated but personally I'm a fan. The signature checking is vital and the syntax checks generally make sense which aid with code quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/570306810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/570309684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8913#issuecomment-570309684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8913","id":570309684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDMwOTY4NA==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T19:09:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T19:09:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Label Bot is not confident enough to auto-label this issue.
