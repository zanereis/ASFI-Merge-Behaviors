Hi, leo65535. Great job. It's nice to see you dealing with the style of the previous code. It is important to point out that once the task start, it is best to deal with all style issues other than JavaDoc-related issues as soon as possible to minimizing the impact on code history.\r\n\r\nHi @morrySnow, there are many rules, I think it's better to split them to several steps.\r\nAnd, it will be hard to review, please refer to [pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/9113), `File changes

Great job. It's nice to see you dealing with the style of the previous code. It is important to point out that once the task start, it is best to deal with all style issues other than JavaDoc-related issues as soon as possible to minimizing the impact on code history.\r\n> \r\n> Hi @morrySnow, there are many rules, I think it's better to split them to several steps. And, it will be hard to review, please refer to [pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/9113), `File changes 1387`.\r\n\r\nYes, `split them to several steps` is necessary. We need to fix all about them asap. The first step from you is very important. After this PR merged, we need to take apart the rest of the rules to avoid two people fixing the same rule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1117534867/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1118039459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/9356#issuecomment-1118039459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/9356","id":1118039459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Co-2j","user":{"login":"liuzhuang2017","id":95120044,"node_id":"U_kgDOBatqrA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95120044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzhuang2017","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhuang2017/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-05T00:07:46Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T00:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@morrySnow

Great job. It's nice to see you dealing with the style of the previous code. It is important to point out that once the task start, it is best to deal with all style issues other than JavaDoc-related issues as soon as possible to minimizing the impact on code history.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Hi @morrySnow, there are many rules, I think it's better to split them to several steps. And, it will be hard to review, please refer to [pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/9113), `File changes 1387`.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, `split them to several steps` is necessary. We need to fix all about them asap. The first step from you is very important. After this PR merged, we need to take apart the rest of the rules to avoid two people fixing the same rule.\r\n\r\n@morrySnow, thanks for the
