http://packages.erlang-solutions.com/debian/erlang_solutions.asc\r\nsudo apt-key add erlang_solutions.asc\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install -y erlang-nox erlang-dev erlang-reltool\r\nsudo

try Erlang from Raspian and see if that makes a difference. \r\n\r\nIf you can give me any advice on how to report the errors I see, and where to raise them (e.g. the Erlang team) that would be much

You can help fix the bug that you identified, and you don't have to be a coder at all.\r\n\r\nFirst, read this: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\nWe also have a code of conduct: https://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html\r\n\r\nThen, if you know GitHub, you can fork the [apache/couchdb-documentation](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation) repository, create a branch (we recommend starting the branch name with the bug #, so something like 231-remove-restart), editing the right file (probably [this one](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/blob/7f8c3abc8882e2ff171ac304a8d9584b7e638845/src/api/server/common.rst), though there are other references that should be removed as well), checking in your code, pushing it to GitHub, and opening a Pull Request (PR).\r\n\r\nAs for training on CouchDB, you might want to start by reading our backlog of mailing list messages: [couchdb-user](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?user@couchdb.apache.org) and [couchdb-dev](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@couchdb.apache.org). There's a lot of valuable information in there.\r\n\r\nOnce again, so happy to have you working with us!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358488443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358499653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1073#issuecomment-358499653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1073","id":358499653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODQ5OTY1Mw==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T00:46:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T00:46:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just want to provide more information for this issue, and I run my tests on physical machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358499653/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/358502458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1032#issuecomment-358502458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1032","id":358502458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODUwMjQ1OA==","user":{"login":"jiangphcn","id":18000622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwNjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangphcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangphcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-18T01:02:07Z","updated_at":"2018-01-18T01:02:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I already rebased again. @wohali or any other committer, can you help merge it to master branch?
