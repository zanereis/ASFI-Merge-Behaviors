The artifact has two _modi operandi_:\r\n\r\n* A fast bridge, which replace JUL entirely, but requires the setting of the `java.util.logging.manager` Java system property in your startup scripts (see [Using LogManager](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-jul.html#bridge-logmanager)).\r\n* A slower bridge, similar to the one in `jul-to-slf4j`, but it provides direct bridging between JUL and Log4j API (without passing through SLF4J). See [Using Log4jBridgeHandler](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-jul.html#bridge-handler).\r\n\r\n> * jcl-over-slf4j, this changed from MIT to ASL in [repo](https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j/blob/v_2.0.16/jcl-over-slf4j/LICENSE.txt), but is still using the [base license](https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j/blob/v_2.0.16/LICENSE.txt) in downloaded package. Not sure which one to use in this case. @janhoy any idea how to handle these cases? Prefer ASL?\r\n\r\nSince the release of `commons-logging` 1.3.0, `jcl-over-slf4j` (as well as `spring-jcl` and `log4j-jcl`) are no longer necessary.

Yet `LBHttp2SolrClient`might not know how to correctly clone that client, keeping in mind `LBHttp2solrClient` is now generic. It seems to me that passing in the pre-built client is more of a relic of the days before we used Bulders in solrJ, and not a really great API decision.  I was hoping to improve that here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2539449326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2539843428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2899#issuecomment-2539843428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2899","id":2539843428,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6XYu9k","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-12T19:28:28Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T19:28:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay with me to stay with the builder.

I like the addition of the TODO to point out where more refactorings can be done. I guess I am wondering, once we have a lot of `.toString()` or `.toPath()`, how do we go back and remove the excess conversion loops? Also, i wonder if we need to add when this is done some forbiddenapi entries for file? I triggered the CI process... hopefully CI will run on all your other commits.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping review @epugh! I found all imports of `java.io.File` and tried to remove it as much as possible. Mostly tried to fix using File if it was trival, otherwise you'll see the `toFile()` or `toPath() This is a first pass through and looks like tests pass. Second pass would probably be to try and remove `toFile()` or `toPath()` as well as creation of any `new File()` as much as possible. If we can make it a forbidden API, the build will tell us where all of them are being called to continue with clean up.\r\n\r\nI found the File api was used so much in Tests, when I was doing conversions the number of lines changes became too much for this PR. I am holding those on my fork for now and hopefully I can maybe push that PR after this one.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2542818507/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2543060012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2907#issuecomment-2543060012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2907","id":2543060012,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6XlAQs","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-14T11:11:01Z","updated_at":"2024-12-14T11:11:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds like you have a strong plan for moving forward @mlbiscoc and that's awesome.

The huge diffs in lock file come from transitive dependencies, so it is normal to have multiple changes if the new libraries have multiple transitive dependencies. You probably don't have to review the file, and I believe the current format that has changed by the plugin we use could also be simplified.\r\n\r\n**I am working on a solution for that and I think I found something interesting. So stay tuned.**\r\n\r\n>  ... or just accept the diff blindly\r\n\r\nIf the tests are green I believe you can accept it blindly. If there is any invalid content, running writeLocks on another machine would generate diffs and raise \"suspicions\", so no worries about that. :)\r\n\r\n> usedUndeclaredArtifacts\r\n\r\nThis comes from a specific plugin, not directly related to dependency version alignment. Basically, a plugin checks if you use classes from libraries that are made available through transitive dependencies. What it asks you is to add the dependency explicitly so that we explicitly include what we use. And when including a library that is not used, it will also complain and report \"unusedDeclaredArtifacts\". I had a hard time to figure that out as well.\r\n\r\n> unusedDeclaredArtifacts\r\n> dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-cohere:0.35.0@jar -> runtime\r\n> dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-hugging-face:0.35.0@jar -> runtime\r\n> dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-mistral-ai:0.35.0@jar -> runtime\r\n> dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-open-ai:0.35.0@jar -> runtime\r\n> dev.langchain4j:langchain4j:0.35.0@jar\r\n\r\nThis is the other case where this library may report false-negatives. If you are implementing a library module, you usually don't include these and let the consumer of your library add them to their dependencies, so they can choose for example the model they want to use. At least that's how I understand the plugin and how I believe the libraries you use work.\r\n\r\nSo if the module you added uses these dependencies, and it is not a library used by Solr users in their own project, then it is fine to add permits and allow the dependencies to be included.

The ref-guide docs for COLSTATUS describe each of the boolean flags as being independent of one another: `segments` returns base segment data, `fieldInfo` returns detailed information about each indexed field, etc.  But in reality on main/branch_9x currently, the flags are dependent on one another.  `fieldInfo` and `sizeInfo` have no impact unless paired with `segments=true`.  And `segments=true` has no impact on its own either.\r\n\r\nThe ref-guide coverage here doesn't suggest that this is intentional in any way, so I suspect this is a bug that eluded @sigram when he first did SOLR-13292.

Imagine if collection admin commands participated in this (not just handlers on the core) like create collection.  Thus when CREATE returns, the header indicates the version of the final created state.   Let's also assume waitForState=true[1].\r\n(B) Even though the CloudSolrClient's cache[2] wouldn't yet have a DocCollection, let's imagine an enhancement to this cache in which it can hold a cache entry without a DocCollection but with a version to indicate we now want this version (or greater).  At least for HTTP ClusterStateProvider, it will fetch the CLUSTERSTATE from Solr via HTTP.  What's new -- imagine it adds the \\_stateVer\\_ parameter.\r\n(C) HttpSolrCall will see the \\_stateVer\\_ param.  If it's DocCollection isn't as high as this version, it forces an update.  I think this part works as-is but perhaps some work may be needed.\r\n\r\n[1] why the heck is waitForState not true by default?\r\n[2] the CSC's cache should move to ClusterStateProvider -- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17604","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2556137265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2556330775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2363#issuecomment-2556330775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2363","id":2556330775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6YXoMX","user":{"login":"markrmiller","id":448788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller","html_url":"https://github.com/markrmiller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markrmiller/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-20T05:45:03Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T05:45:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah, that’s how I would do it.

Still need to look into David's question about use of `Instant`\r\n\r\nAlright - the main hiccup for using `Instant` is that it's not supported by our serialization layer.  Jackson supports it pretty easily on the v2 side, but our v1 \"ResponseWriter\"-based serialization code doesn't.  (The v1 code needs support because of how our v1 APIs are built \"on top of\" the v2 APIs - \"primitive\" types used in the v2 POJO end up in the NamedList that the v1 code serializes out.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think it would be nice to support this, but I don't want to squeeze it into this PR so I'm not tempted to skimp on testing, etc.  I've filed [a ticket for it](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17608), and hope to pursue that shortly.  In the meantime I added 'TODO' comments to the places David flagged as being 'Instant'-ready - we can circle back to those either as a part of SOLR-17608, or once it's done.\r\n\r\n(FYI @dsmiley )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2558115243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2558160012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2482#issuecomment-2558160012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2482","id":2558160012,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6YemyM","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-21T16:02:00Z","updated_at":"2024-12-21T16:02:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW, I think this was a nice idea, and maybe in the future we'll add it if we see more folks using powershell.

The change to BaseHttpClusterStateProvider should have made this glaringly obvious but I overlooked its implication earlier (face-palm).\r\n> \r\n> I wouldn't mind if we do this only for V2 (which doesn't yet have back-compatibility concerns) but V2 only has one collection status list returning API (/cluster) and I've debated against the very existence of /cluster for V2. There's not yet a proposal for an alternative. Furthermore V2 raises the bigger question of coalescing on a single DocCollection serialization method.\r\n> \r\n> If we forge ahead anyway (not waiting for V2), we'll have to work around this compatibility. I had a couple ideas but whittled down to one:\r\n> \r\n> * detect the response format in this handler.  If it's Javabin, we write to a NamedList (or better, SimpleOrderedMap), defeating the point of this PR _for that format_.  If JSON/XML is used, this PR will accomplish its goal. Need to write a little test for JSON that at least partially sanity checks the result.  Such a test should pass without this PR.\r\n\r\nWell thats unfortunate... I'm not too familiar with SolrJ (I'll maybe play with it more to catch stuff like this) but I am assuming now the API is going to return a `Map` and no longer a `NamedList` to the client thus breaking them now?\r\n\r\nI'll continue with this and add in your ideas to keep this backwards compatible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2558290502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2558531096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2914#issuecomment-2558531096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2914","id":2558531096,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6YgBYY","user":{"login":"psalagnac","id":82967811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY3ODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82967811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac","html_url":"https://github.com/psalagnac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-22T17:35:14Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T17:35:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> bug fixes can go into 9.8\r\n\r\nThanks.

This new platform module adds constraints to all modules that depend on it, either directly or via transitive dependencies. And the constraints currently applied are all the dependency versions currently present in the version catalog. So SolrJ only inherits the constraints, \"forcing it\" to use the same dependency versions as the rest of the project for the dependencies it has.\r\n\r\nWhat I am not sure and need to verify is, do we set this way the constraints for any consumer of SolrJ as well, even for dependencies SolrJ does not include? If so, this would probably not be optimal.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, this could probably be resolved by including a different version catalog for SolrJ, as Gradle allows having multiple version catalogs.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting, that the previous solution (if I am correct) was applying the constraints to all module configurations as well, but only if there was any conflict in any of the modules and we had to add explicitly a rule. So SolrJ inherited constraints that were not necessarily part of it anyway. So this solution should not have a large impact, but it is still under investigation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2560092738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
