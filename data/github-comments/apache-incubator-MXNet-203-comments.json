I originally had one more step in the example with x, but decided it added nothing to the demonstration of the error and simplified the example by removing it without fixing that part :p I fixed the code in the original message.\r\n\r\nThis is the complete output on the infer_shape:\r\n```\r\n>>> c.infer_shape()\r\n__main__:1: UserWarning: Cannot decide shape for the following arguments (0s in shape means unknown dimensions). Consider providing them as input:\r\n\t\r\n(None, None, None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it thinks there are zeros, but then doesn't report any arguments with zeros, just a blank line. It might not report any because the zeros do not appear in any any variables; it's after the broadcast. (If so, maybe that error message should be improved?) Regardless, the infer_shape_partial does not report any zeros either. I listed its output shape previously, but for completeness, here the full output of that call:\r\n```\r\n>>> c.infer_shape_partial()\r\n([(1, 3)], [(5, 2, 3)], [])\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, everything is complete, with no zeros.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this result is because infer_shape_partial is printing out what it expects the output to be, before everything is checked, but then the information doesn't get passed down anyway? That would coincide with what piiswong said about concat not doing the backward part of the shape; however, I don't think the problem is with concat, because as I noted, it was fine with the last code block I showed which required concat pushing back information to the broadcast as well.

This simplified example actually followed from a use case myself and colleagues had where concat was on a second dimension (has to do with mixture models).\r\n\r\nThe broadcast_axis was also deliberately sized to zero so that it can be inferred to match the batch dimension. (In actual practice x would be something more like a data arg and y a tunable variable/weight, but I don't think it's important to describe the specific reasoning we ran into this problem). size=0 in this way is entirely valid when the operations support the backward shape inference, as in shown in the last code block I posted (that eschews the expand_dims) which also has size=0 in the broadcast and which works fine.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be with expand_dims. As piiswrong said, it sounds like the issue is that expand_dims doesn't do the backward shape inference. Since I'm not up to speed on the backend side of mxnet, it's not something I can fix myself soon.

have a simmilar question to itijyou. Is there an assignment analog to the ndarray.take function ? \r\nFor example, lets take a simple case of sorting, where we take an array 'a', and attempt to set the 4 lowest valued indices to 0. The last step 'a[c] = 0' does not throw an error, however it also does not perform the assignment to 'a'.\r\n\r\npython\r\n>>> import mxnet as mx\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> a = mx.nd.array(np.array([1,4,6,2,4,5,6,2]))\r\n>>> a.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 1.,  4.,  6.,  2.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  2.], dtype=float32)\r\n\r\n#### sort the array and find the indices of the 4 lowest valued entries\r\n>>> b = mx.nd.argsort(a)\r\n>>> b.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 0.,  3.,  7.,  1.,  4.,  5.,  2.,  6.], dtype=float32)\r\n>>> c=b[0:4]\r\n>>> c.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 0.,  3.,  7.,  1.], dtype=float32)\r\n\r\n####  ndarray.take() can be used to read the values in 'a' corresponding to the indices in 'c'\r\n>>> d = mx.nd.take(a,c)\r\n>>> d.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 1.,  2.,  2.,  4.], dtype=float32)\r\n\r\n#### How do we write to 'a' at the indices given by 'c'. Following does not work:\r\n>>> a[c] = 0\r\n>>> a.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 1.,  4.,  6.,  2.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  2.], dtype=float32)\r\n\r\nAny help or alternative would be helpful. The only alternative I can think of is the following, which is ugly and does not really work well if the values in 'a' are not unique:\r\n\r\n#### select the 4th smallest element\r\n>>> c=b[4]\r\n>>> c.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 4.], dtype=float32)\r\n>>> d = mx.nd.take(a,c)\r\n>>> d.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 4.], dtype=float32)\r\n\r\n#### create a binary mask of all elements larger than the 4th smallest element\r\n>>> mask = a > d\r\n>>> mask.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  1.,  0.], dtype=float32)\r\n>>> mask = 1-mask\r\n>>> mask.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 1.,  1.,  0.,  1.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  1.], dtype=float32)\r\n>>> e = a * mask\r\n>>> e.asnumpy()\r\narray([ 1.,  4.,  0.,  2.,  4.,  0.,  0.,  2.], dtype=float32)\r\n\r\nAs you see, there is an extra '4' in the 'e' result.\r\n\r\nMy real life application is to perform hard negative sampling based on the loss values. For example, I have a 60x40 loss matrix, and I need to find the top 100 loss values, and set the gradients corresponding to the rest to 0. I can do this easily in numpy but would prefere a pure mx.ndarray based solution.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/307825875/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/307844753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6615#issuecomment-307844753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6615","id":307844753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzg0NDc1Mw==","user":{"login":"sbodenstein","id":10237782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM3Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10237782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein","html_url":"https://github.com/sbodenstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-12T16:36:10Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T16:36:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ykim362: \r\n\r\n```\r\na = mx.sym.Activation(act_type=\"relu\", data = mx.sym.Variable('a'))\r\ne = a.bind(mx.cpu(), {'a': mx.nd.array([1,2])})\r\ny = e.forward()\r\n```\r\nproduces:\r\n```\r\n[18:26:50] /mxnet/dmlc-core/include/dmlc/logging.h:304: [18:26:50] /mxnet/nnvm/include/nnvm/tuple.h:446: Check failed: dim == static_cast<int>(ndim()) (4 vs. 1) dimension do not match target dimension 4 vs 1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/307844753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/307845616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6538#issuecomment-307845616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6538","id":307845616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzg0NTYxNg==","user":{"login":"jli05","id":3519667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3519667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05","html_url":"https://github.com/jli05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-12T16:39:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-12T16:39:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought that Dockerfile is only for CI test?

think this is done now. \r\nI added an additional flag to the configs USE_LAPACK which is 1 by default. So there is always an easy option to turn it off. \r\n\r\nIn the default mode (USE_LAPACK=1), it will add lapack support whenever we use one of the blas distributions that contain lapack (apple/atlas/openblas/mkl). Concerning Ubuntu, the state is that 14.04 and 16.04 are almost equivalent: In both cases, lapack is part of the official packages. The difference is that on 14.04, installing openblas will not automatically install the lapack library while in 16.04 it does. In both cases, \r\nsudo apt-get install -y libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev\r\nwill get all necessary pieces (just that in 16.04 there would be no need for referencing liblapack explicitly, but it will work either way). Tested that explicitly on the different images. \r\nSo our docker container can happily stay at 14.04 with the small change that it also installs liblapack-dev now. No need to migrate to 16.04. \r\n\r\nIn my most recent run, one of the travis-ci builds times out when doing some tests on neural networks (not related to the new functionalities herein). Seen this happen in the past from time to time, may be we want to give this tests a bit more time by default. So all is clean.\r\n\r\nI will work on integrating cuda support for these operators  as soon as this PR gets integrated. Don't want to pile up more stuff on top of this. This will result in a small bit of internal restructuring. The goal would be to provide a common internal abstraction layer that handles the different DTypes and CPU vs. GPU automatically for the blas3/lapack functions (as suggested by the reviews). \r\nLet me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/308109973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/308117132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6538#issuecomment-308117132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6538","id":308117132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODExNzEzMg==","user":{"login":"jli05","id":3519667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3519667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05","html_url":"https://github.com/jli05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-13T13:33:09Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T13:33:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"- Alternatively, could we merge this PR with CPU code first so that I could submit my PRs on tensors?
