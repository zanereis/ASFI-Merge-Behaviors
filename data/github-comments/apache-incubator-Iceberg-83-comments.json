Once the comments above are addressed, I think this can be committed to master.\r\n\r\nI know the intent is to get this into a patch release, but I don't think that we should do that with a new behavior change for Hive catalogs by default.

That's the right direction, but I don't think the change should be in a patch release.\r\n\r\nWe could, however, add this with a flag to still delete the data files or to fall back to not throwing the unknown commit state exception.

I'm still trying to figure out how to test it, I don't think I can conclude from profiling alone that it performs better using  the number of samples. I tried to run some of JMH benchmarks in Iceberg repo, sometimes they work, other times I get an error related to shadowJar and jmh plugins, some error with `META-INF`. I tried to use JMH in my code base, but for some reason I could not get it to work.\r\n\r\nNote that non of the existing frameworks in the code base use it, so if you ran some test you would get the same numbers, in particular the following files use the `UnboxedReader`:\r\n\r\n- FlinkParquetReaders.ReadBuilder\r\n- BaseParquetReaders.ReadBuilder\r\n- ParquetAvroValueReaders.ReadBuilder\r\n- PigParquetReader.ReadBuilder\r\n- SparkParquetReaders.ReadBuilder\r\n\r\nMy plan was to get the API first, then update them afterwards. I will update them soon.\r\n\r\nRegarding the flame graphs, this is the old one with two methods underlined.\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5780138/112067786-b80b8b00-8b79-11eb-9d15-e8cb1f64db83.png)\r\n\r\nFrom the left `UnboxedReader.read` indicate that there are no benefits in `UnboxedReader`, as all calls end up going to the interface method, which returns an object. In the far right there is `get` which in case of a Java primitive, you would get a boxed primitive, the result of `get`  is passed to the `UnboxedReader` and it ignores it. The signature of read method `public T read(T ignored)`. After getting the result from the reader it's passed to the method `set` in `StructReader`.\r\n\r\nI will update other readers to use the new implementation and run the test you mentioned. If you have any suggestion regarding benchmarking, let me know, as it is a new ground for me.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/804451815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/804471561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2328#issuecomment-804471561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2328","id":804471561,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDQ3MTU2MQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-22T23:46:18Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T23:46:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue, when we started looking into this problem, it was not clear how the fix will look like.
