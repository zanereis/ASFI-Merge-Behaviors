After that, we try to create the realtime consumer. But as pointed out, if there is an invalid config for the consumer, an exception is thrown. The next time you try to create the table (with correct configs), it checks the ZK property store for the existence of the table config and throws an exception saying that the table already exists (although the table creation process did not finish).\r\n\r\n**Why does the table not show up with GET `/tables`?**\r\nIt checks for the tables existence in the ideal state [resources](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-controller/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/controller/helix/core/PinotHelixResourceManager.java#L604). Because the realtime table creation process never completed, the realtime table was not added to the ZK ideal state.\r\n\r\n**Why did deleting the table not fix the issue?**\r\nTable deletion should have actually fixed the issue because it deletes the config from the property store (verified that this was the case). The return message from the operation was misleading because it only returns a success message if the table was originally in the ideal state.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\nThe table existence check for table creation is inconsistent with the other table operations (GET and DELETE). For table creation, we should check the table existence in the ideal state instead of checking for the table config in the property store. If the table config already existed in the property store, it should be ok to overwrite since the table was never fully created.\r\n\r\nAny stray table configs can still be deleted via DELETE `/tables/{tableName}` or `/tableConfig/{tableName}`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1095670691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1095697491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8508#issuecomment-1095697491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8508","id":1095697491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5BTwRT","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T23:40:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T00:00:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8508?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8508](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8508?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (b6d5084) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/e4b1d050a2c94ecbc1b4db4d652abad0b571b747?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (e4b1d05) will **decrease** coverage by `43.76%`.\n> The diff coverage is `40.00%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head b6d5084 differs from pull request most recent head 63d67fb.

Using some sort of an ID. The problem is that the threads taking up any of these activities can be in any order. [Of course, we may choose not to handle multiple simultaneous requests]. In this case, it is useful to know the _highest_ sequence number of messages handled. \r\n\r\nAnd then we need to consider restarts. If a server restarts, then we should treat it as if all messages are handled. Then we may enter into race conditions when a message may never be received (or discarded after receipt), etc. Not very straight-forward.\r\n\r\nA more complete solution will be to keep a mirror of the IDEALSTATE znode in zk (or, if Helix 1.x supports additional data along with idealstate). For example,\r\n`\"segment_0\": { \"host1\": {\"ONLINE\", \"105\"}, \"host2\":{\"ONLINE\", 106\"}}`\r\nIn this case, it indicates that host 1 processed message 105 whereas host2 processed 106.\r\nUnless helix 1.x supports an idealstate extension natively, this can lead to a new znode, something we have tried to avoid in the past.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we NOT implement this API. Instead, we consider the use cases.\r\n\r\nMost common cases:\r\n- operators may issue a single reload, and can use the segment status API to get the status\r\n- operators almost never will try to get statuses and verify that they are the same if no reload is issued. So, we either remove this from the test code, or just put a sleep. But let us not code for this to work right.\r\n- If operators indeed issue multiple reloads for the (segments of) same table, the code will work fine as long as the bug that has been found is fixed (the bug where we load the table config before grabbing the semaphore).\r\n\r\nJust fix the bug, and document it well (that if users have 1000 servers for a single table, and do a reload, the zookeeper server may be overloaded with 1000 requests coming in at the same time.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1096995899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1097023355","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8485#issuecomment-1097023355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8485","id":1097023355,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5BYz97","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-12T17:54:51Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T17:54:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Importantly, when a tracer which produces enabled recordings is not enabled, all these trace points are skipped.

If the request isn't traced, inert/no-op scopes are produced. These must be effectively free otherwise it causes problems with overhead. With this design, tracing is basically free when inactive.\r\n* recording enabled is different: even if a request isn't traced, the instrumentation code is the same either way and might try to perform expensive work. When tracing is enabled, performing expensive work is justified, but it needs to be avoided when it's off, so `isEnabled` is a way to ask if the active recording is on or not, to avoid doing that expensive work. Even when tracing is enabled, a particular implementation may not be interested in a particular piece of data, so may choose not to enable a scope. Having the checks in the instrumentation code allows disabled scopes to avoid the cost of data collection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1097100108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1097101989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8512#issuecomment-1097101989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8512","id":1097101989,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5BZHKl","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-12T18:57:12Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T18:57:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We don't support it right now because we are using joda library and haven't moved to java library for performance reason.

On a single server, it can have up to one consuming segment per partition; but on multiple servers serving the same segment, they might not finish sealing the segment at the same time. On the broker side, it might show as multiple consuming segments. The routing fix in your commit can solve the inconsistency, but might also cause hotspot server because all the queries will be routed to the servers which finish the segment sealing first. To address this, one solution would be to also enhance the instance selector so that it queries the consuming segment on a server only when the server is picked to serve the last completed segment.\r\n\r\nThere is more to the current design on segment replicas.

For example `intColumn > cast(10.3 as long)` could just be rewritten to` intColumn > 10.3` and things would still work fine.\r\n2) we should probably throw a syntax error if user tries to do something like `intColumn > '12.3'` or `intColumn > cast('10.3' as INT)` (casting a string literal to an int value) and that will encourage the user to write query with proper literal values.\r\n3) A cast function is probably more useful during run time if for example the user wants to force cast string column values into numerical values (for example `WHERE CAST(stringColumn AS INTEGER) > intColumn`. Otherwise, as far as compile time literals are concerned, it seems like just replacing the CAST function with literal would work? If the literal type is not compatible, then an exception will be thrown which will encourage user to fix the literal in the query?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1098607748/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1098751766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8540#issuecomment-1098751766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8540","id":1098751766,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5BfZ8W","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-14T06:23:27Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T06:40:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8540?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8540](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8540?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (77b6c0f) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/58ffe947b6c6509697fca8943282906e76351c90?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (58ffe94) will **increase** coverage by `0.16%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8540      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     70.53%   70.69%   +0.16%     \n- Complexity     4287     4290       +3     \n============================================\n  Files          1681     1681              \n  Lines         87913    87955      +42     \n  Branches      13309    13319      +10     \n============================================\n+ Hits          62009    62182     +173     \n+ Misses        21601    21426     -175     \n- Partials       4303     4347      +44     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `27.06% <100.00%> (+0.26%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `25.89% <0.00%> (-0.07%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `67.02% <ø> (+<0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `14.05% <0.00%> (-0.01%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Currently `CastTransformFunction` doesn't support multi-valued column casting. We should keep the scalar function and transform function consistent (either both support MV or both not support MV). IMO multi-value handling is a little bit tricky because of the array type (primitive vs boxed), and we should add some queries test to ensure it works end-to-end and covers ingestion, compilation, aggregation and post-aggregation. I'd suggest first adding the basic support for SV, and then having a separate PR to add the MV support\r\n\r\nI agree that dropping MV support would simplify this a lot.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1098820054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1098822932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8535#issuecomment-1098822932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8535","id":1098822932,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5BfrUU","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-14T08:03:32Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T10:15:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Some thoughts:\r\n> \r\n> 1. one option may be to drop the cast function if it is casting something to a numeric type. For example `intColumn > cast(10.3 as long)` could just be rewritten to` intColumn > 10.3` and things would still work fine.\r\n> 2. we should probably throw a syntax error if user tries to do something like `intColumn > '12.3'` or `intColumn > cast('10.3' as INT)` (casting a string literal to an int value) and that will encourage the user to write query with proper literal values.\r\n> 3. A cast function is probably more useful during run time if for example the user wants to force cast string column values into numerical values (for example `WHERE CAST(stringColumn AS INTEGER) > intColumn`. Otherwise, as far as compile time literals are concerned, it seems like just replacing the CAST function with literal would work? If the literal type is not compatible, then an exception will be thrown which will encourage user to fix the literal in the query?\r\n\r\nI agree, this is essentially what adding this scalar function allows an existing mechanism to do. This change allows replacing the cast function over a literal _or over another function which can be calculated at compile time_ with the literal, by making a function available during query compilation - see `CompileTimeFunctionsInvoker`.
