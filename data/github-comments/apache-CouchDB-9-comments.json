You really handled all of these, even some wishes! (: I didn't expect that you handle them all since I put them just to not forget about how it would be possible to improve the bulk deletion - I had to noted that /:\n\nAbout the changes: all cool! Everything works! \\o/ \nJust two little moments:\n1. in case of deletion failure (due to lack of permission or validation function) Fauxton says: `Failed to destroy: foobarbaz`.  May be use \"deleted\" term instead of \"destroy\"? It's common and sounds more recoverable as deletion is. Sorry, didn't have a chance to test this on first review because of other bugs.\n2. document selection by click on the row works, but not above and under checkbox space:\n\n![some doc](http://i.imgur.com/QJ5MIwT.png)\n\nOn image above it showed: red box is the dead zone when click doesn't selects the doc, green boxes are where it does. Since \"red zone\" is bigger than green ones, it's really sweet spot for the click.

With a real div as box we could also add a scrollbar and stuff like this, so we wouldn't even have to limit it to 50 items.\n\n+1.

Say, you'd selected some docs, click on delete all button and in the next second figure out that you done wrong things. The idea is the same as in gmail: undo deletion, undo sent, allowing to undo any operation which causes the major changes in the next few seconds before they'll really get applied. Not much critical, but useful feature.  Again, if do this right, I believe that will come in result as new Fauxton module which covers a lot of other cases too (like undo config option deletion and more).
