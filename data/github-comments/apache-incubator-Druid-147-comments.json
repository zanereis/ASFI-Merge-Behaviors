(for now) by #4394, which implements the following behavior:\r\n\r\n- Missing columns are treated as `null` values.\r\n- `null` values in string context are treated the same as empty strings, so `strlen(x)` is 0 if x is null.\r\n- `null` values in numeric context are treated as zeroes, so `x + y` is 3 if x is null and y is 3.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is generally consistent with basic Druid column selectors, which will treat missing columns as null or 0 (based on the selector type).\r\n\r\nRelated: #4349, which may bring more sweeping

Effectively not shuffling before was probably not testing something hard enough, and the fact that tests were passing shouldn't mean that not shuffling is ok.\r\n\r\nYeah, okay, I looked at the code more closely and I guess it was trying to verify consistency both for sequential and random access, but really only sequential was being verified. I bet we can optimize the shuffle to do better than `Collections.shuffle(Ints.asList(indices))` but there will still be some speed hit, since it wasn't doing it at all before as you pointed out.\r\n\r\n> Also before 6edee7f builds were passing as least sometimes, but after this PR I didn't see a single build passing.\r\n\r\nTravis did pass at least once on that patch, namely, on the original run before the PR was merged: https://travis-ci.org/druid-io/druid/builds/242675086\r\n\r\nI wonder if it's a coincidence? It seems like a lot of recent travis builds are failing on timeouts during CompressedVSizeIntsIndexedSupplierTest, and I tried running that on my laptop before and after 6edee7f and didn't see much difference (about 5.5 minutes both ways). I haven't tried running the entire test suite before and after though. I checked some older runs on master and it looks like the runtime is very close to Travis's limit of 10 minutes with no output before failing (in some cases, it's over 10 minutes -- maybe Travis timeouts are enforced loosely):\r\n\r\n- https://travis-ci.org/druid-io/druid/jobs/240053478\r\n- https://travis-ci.org/druid-io/druid/jobs/240189328\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the runtime of the test was very close to the limit for a while, and maybe Travis is slightly slower now than it used to be, putting it over the limit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/308819059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/308843054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4384#issuecomment-308843054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4384","id":308843054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODg0MzA1NA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T19:29:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T19:29:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@himanshug

If so, we can handle expressions evaluating multi-valued columns in the same way as we handle columns of different types. For example, an \"value filter\" expression like ```multi_valued_column = 1``` would be false due to the different types of two operands of ```=```.\r\n\r\nAlso, this can be extended to be more useful by supporting more functions like ```array_contains()``` or ```explode()``` which is a UDTF in Hive. In the above example, we can expect ```array_contains(multi_valued_column, 1)``` will have the same effect with our current \"value filter\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309189075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309189291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4410#issuecomment-309189291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4410","id":309189291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTE4OTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T03:08:46Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T03:08:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also it seems wasteful to have separate merge buffer pool and intermediate results buffer pool. Resources should be shared.  As far as I can understand the justification is [here](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/2987):\r\n\r\n> DruidProcessingModule provides a new `@Merged` BlockingPool<ByteBuffer> that can be used for merging. It has a fixed maximum size and it's blocking, so jetty threads can request one when they want to do a query that will require a merge buffer, and then wait in line if one is not available (without submitting tasks to the processing thread pool). Queries that don't need merging buffers don't have to wait.\r\n\r\nBut it is still not clear to me why a separate pool was needed. If it is a matter of blocking vs non-blocking, `StupidPool` could have a blocking mode method to request a buffer only if available and wait for availability if it is not. @gianm could you comment?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309189291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309191629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4422#issuecomment-309191629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4422","id":309191629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTE5MTYyOQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T04:03:24Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T04:03:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The new approach could be combined with experiments on off-heap space pre-allocation for dimension values.

If it is a matter of blocking vs non-blocking, StupidPool could have a blocking mode method to request a buffer only if available and wait for availability if it is not. @gianm could you comment?\r\n\r\nThe idea is that processing buffers are \"owned\" by a processing thread (that's why there's one allocated per thread) and merge buffers are \"owned\" by a query.\r\n\r\nIf they used a shared pool, we would have to be careful to avoid situations where one processing thread can't get a buffer and it can't do any work, hobbling the processing thread pool. An extreme case of this would be if all buffers in the pool were allocated as query merge buffers, and there were none left for processing threads. Then none of the queries could proceed at all, and the system would be un-responsive, since all processing threads would be blocked trying to allocate processing buffers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309235738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309236028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4405#issuecomment-309236028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4405","id":309236028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTIzNjAyOA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T19:45:18Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T19:46:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Ah this is the same idea with my comment. +1 for this idea.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think it makes sense to add array types to expressions in a future patch.

The current memory allocation system does have too many configs and it's difficult to size them optimally (and, like you pointed out, can be impossible to achieve really optimal behavior for heterogenous workloads).\r\n\r\nDespite the weaknesses of the current system, it does have one good feature: once a query starts it doesn't ever need to block waiting to allocate more memory. The memory is all reserved up front, and then the query proceeds until complete. If queries allocated memory more dynamically, we need some way of dealing with a situation where two queries both want to allocate the \"last chunk\" of available memory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309236485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309237622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4421#issuecomment-309237622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4421","id":309237622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTIzNzYyMg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T20:15:55Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T20:15:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Removing the config sounds good to me, non-default values seem to be in clear violation of the PathChildrenCache contract.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309237622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309237732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4376#issuecomment-309237732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4376","id":309237732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTIzNzczMg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T20:17:49Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T20:18:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In that case, it sounds like the config should be removed, as #4421 suggests.
