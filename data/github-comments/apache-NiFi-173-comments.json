The latest updates are helpful.\r\n\r\nThe one remaining concern is the use of the JDK Virtual Machine classes through reflection, which apparently doesn't work on Java 17. Given that those are not part of the public JDK, it seems like a different approach should be evaluated.\r\n\r\nI will take another look and run through some tests soon. This includes a lot of great improvements and features, so thanks for working through the feedback process!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1150584129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1151057696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6109#issuecomment-1151057696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6109","id":1151057696,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Em78g","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T12:27:30Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T12:27:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM,

When a new flowfile is passed to the processor during sending data through an existing websocket connection, might terminate the connection before the entire data is processed. We tried to reproduce it and we've been able to do it only once. The PR's has a low priority due to the lack of usage of this feature. @turcsanyip The last thing I can do is to debug the connection while sending a new flowfile to the processor to check thoroughly again if the connection gets terminated, but as I said I wasn't able to reproduce it lately.

you for the feedback, @exceptionfactory.  This change does alter behavior when \"Use Versions\" is set to true, but I think it brings it more in line with expectations and how other S3 clients behave.  When fetching a specific version's tags, other clients -- including the AWS CLI -- give the specific version's tags rather than the latest version's tags.  This change does not alter behavior when \"Use Versions\" is set to false, which is the default value.  The latest tags are given with only the latest version of the object listed.\r\n\r\nAs an example flow, if you do:\r\nGetFile -> PutS3Object -> TagS3Object (populating the Version ID property)\r\n...you'll only ever get the latest version's tags for all versions of the object when ListS3 runs.  You won't retrieve the tags you set for each specific version.  This change alters the behavior to always list the given version's tags--and not just the latest version's tags as though they belonged to all versions--when Use Versioning is enabled.\r\n\r\nI had been thinking of this more as a bug where the wrong tags are being returned for versioned objects, but I'd be happy to add a property to control which set of tags is returned if you think it is necessary for backwards compatibility, even if it is unexpected behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1164816605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1164976636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6154#issuecomment-1164976636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6154","id":1164976636,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5FcCH8","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-23T22:31:34Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T22:31:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What I'm not 100% certain about is whether all the merging is handled correctly.

Theer is only one outstanding item. Of course I don't want to spend too much time on it. I'm accepting this is how it is done by the community just wanted to take one last stab at it:\r\n\r\n> As far use use of the `final` keyword, it is strongly preferred as it provides a quick indicator that method parameters cannot and will not be changed during method processing. Although languages like Kotlin make this the default behavior, Java requires the keyword to enforce the behavior, so it is best to apply it across the board.\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation. I know there could be a lot of pros and cons raised and there would be plenty of articles to be found across the internet justifying each point. My opinion is that even if we declare each method parameter final that just tells us that the reference won't be reassigned inside the method (which doesn't have any affect on the caller's reference) however even the final \"annotated\" object's state / properties can be changed if the object is not immutable. Based on the code I saw immutability is not followed from top to bottom and I thought adding final for every parameter is noisy (makes the code longer) and misleading as you can change the object inside the function as you wish you just can't reassign the reference to it which would have affect only inside the scope of the function anyway.\r\nOf course if this is a must follow constraint in the NiFi codebase then there is not much to talk about I will add it everywhere just wanted to explain why I think it is counter productive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1166350542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1166913123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6159#issuecomment-1166913123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6159","id":1166913123,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5Fja5j","user":{"login":"timeabarna","id":38653567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjUzNTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38653567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna","html_url":"https://github.com/timeabarna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timeabarna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-27T06:09:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T13:28:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @jfrazee and @exceptionfactory,\r\n\r\nI've managed to get to modifying PutAzureDataLake processor upload.\r\nLast year we had a long discussion how different services like Spark or HDFS could be impacted by this change.\r\nBased on that discussion, can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5098), the following design decisions have been made for this PR:\r\n\r\nList processor: \r\n     - A boolean property has been created to turn on or off showing temp directory in list results.
