This comes in handy in cases where users are trying to optimize indices and may try out different options. While the obsolete indices themselves do not cause any issues with CPU/Memory usage of Pinot servers, they may eat up disk storage that can be expensive, moreover, may prevent pushing of more data (experienced in certain deployments already). This can be achieved in multiple ways:\r\n- Re-download of segments from controller/deep-store, and then build the necessary indices as per the indexing config.\r\n- Let the servers themselves cleanup the indices (as part of reload) locally, without needing to download from controller.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/901483979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/901487852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7320#issuecomment-901487852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7320","id":901487852,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41u5zs","user":{"login":"klsince","id":61892277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODkyMjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61892277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince","html_url":"https://github.com/klsince","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klsince/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-18T23:10:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T23:10:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is 're-push of segment' the feature described in this issue https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7321? \r\n\r\nIn fact, as followups from the incident, we planned these two options: 1) add option to force segment download (mainly for mitigation); 2) enable index cleanup for V3 format, so that indices on servers stay in sync with what's set in table config not just when adding new ones but also when removing old ones.\r\n\r\nIn general, re-push of segment is kinda heavy lifting for index cleanup particularly for large table, as it incurs considerable network egress cost while downloading large volume of data.

The cleanup happens in the same thread doing segment reloading, and it leverages the current failure handling mechanism (as in [code](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-server/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/server/starter/helix/HelixInstanceDataManager.java#L276)) of segment reloading to keep disk states consistent upon failures, and be atomic when swapping in the cleaned segment. With this atomicity, the queries can continue to work with the existing segment until the new one is swapped in.\r\n\r\nJust like adding new indices during segment reloading, removing indices is also done inside the segment folder **not** accessed by ongoing queries, so it's safe to modify the files in the folder. To cleanup, we simply copy the indices defined in table config into a temp file, then rename it back to index file, effectively removing those not set in table config any more. In implementation, we use transferTo() for copy as in [the PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7301/files#diff-52f126f7138a706a5fddb9257af1c558c4623269bc69308212a77c06021cbef7R433)\r\n\r\nBesides, cleanup happens after adding new indices so that newly created indices are kept after cleanup. In implementation, it just needs to do cleanup after closing all PinotDataBuffers as in [the PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7301/files#diff-52f126f7138a706a5fddb9257af1c558c4623269bc69308212a77c06021cbef7R365). \r\n\r\nHope this helps clarify a bit more, and feel free to comment the PR. Thanks!\r\n\r\nRe 1, I assume it's not always available to ssh to servers to delete segments, so an option to force segment download via Pinot restful API can be convenient.

The general idea in this PR is to copy indices still set in table config to a temp file, placed them contiguously there, and then rename the temp file back to the index file, and update the index_map accordingly. The cleanup is done at file level, w/o need to track position info into the PinotDataBuffer. \r\n\r\niiuc, I think the major difference from the idea in your prototype, is the use of a temp file to simplify the cleanup and do cleanup in one batch at the end of segment reloading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/901608648/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/901699510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7333#issuecomment-901699510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7333","id":901699510,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c41vte2","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-19T08:04:16Z","updated_at":"2021-08-21T11:34:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7333?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7333](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7333?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (f03c373) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/bb34406aaa205f5c85b88c928d477fd267eda1b4?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (bb34406) will **increase** coverage by `4.79%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head f03c373 differs from pull request most recent head ddf5e79.

Apart from the issues mentioned above, it is also confusing to the users who are trying to push to multiple tables, as to which outDir should correspond to the controller's dataDir (recently asked in the slack community). Currently it is optimized for push-time.\r\n\r\nOne proposal could be as follows:\r\n- For general case, the controller trigger a background copy of data from outDir to under controller's dataDir/<tableName>.\r\n- For advanced users who know what they are doing and have the right permissions, the outDir (<tableName>) can directly be under the controller's dataDir. This would avoid any redundant copy and make the data push fast.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/903013387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/903013469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7328#issuecomment-903013469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7328","id":903013469,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c410uRd","user":{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-20T23:59:28Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T23:59:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @yupeng9 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/903013469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/903013488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7305#issuecomment-903013488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7305","id":903013488,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c410uRw","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-20T23:59:34Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T23:59:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@galalen Thanks for volunteering.
