I'd imagine you want to plug in some other implementation via the setImplementation(), instead of extending this class, you may implement the interface\r\n\r\nIsn't that almost the same as I did? The only difference is whether the _thing_ is a class or an interface. I can change it (and I guess I will), but TBH it doesn't seem something that important. The only difference is whether implementation can extend other classes, which I don't think that will be that common (and in that case it could be changed when needed!).\r\n\r\nIt won't reduce the number of changes at all. Even worse, given that we are in Java 8-11, if `Implementation` is an interface, we cannot have non public utility methods like we have in the current class. We have a protected method `getScanBasedFilterPriority` right now.\r\n\r\nIn order to merge this PR sooner I will change the class to an interface and move `getScanBasedFilterPriority` in order to be a public method, but TBH I think the quality of the code is quite worse in this way than in the previous one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1455642343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1455671800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10371#issuecomment-1455671800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10371","id":1455671800,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Ww8n4","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-06T08:11:38Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T08:11:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Even I'm don't like the interface + default implementation change at all, I've change it in order to be able to merge this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1455671800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1455758280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10372#issuecomment-1455758280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10372","id":1455758280,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5WxRvI","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-06T09:14:03Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T09:14:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> IIUC, the intention is to batch more reads from ForwardIndexReader to reduce the total times of accessing the reader? If that is the case, I think we should add the batch size into the SVScanDocIdIterator constructor without changing the applyAnd() interface\r\n\r\nThat would make the change quite more complex. There are two buffers in this algorithm: the one used by `WhateverMatcher` \r\nand the one used by `applyAnd`. Let's call `buffer` to the one in `WhateverMatcher` and `docIds` to the one in `applyAnd`.\r\n\r\nThe code assumes that:\r\n- `length` <= `docIds.length` <= `buffer.length`. The reality is that `docIds.length` == `buffer.length`\r\n- `length` entries are going to be read into `buffer`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure on what you suggest, but I'm going to assume that the idea is to increase `buffer.length` and break the second invariant.\r\n\r\nI think that would make the code quite more complex. `buffer` would need to be an actual cache over the data that is read and must read in some batch size defined at construction time. Then we would need a cursor to indicate which entry was the last that was consumed by the caller. Finally each time we call `readValuesSV` (I'm assuming with MV would be the same) we would need to check whether there are enough elements in `buffer` which may be resolved as:\r\n1. There are more documents to read than `length`, so directly read from `buffer` and move the cursor.\r\n2. `buffer` is exhausted, so read more from the backend, set the cursor to 0 and repeat.\r\n3. `buffer` is not exhausted but there are not enough elements to read. First consume the elements on `buffer`, then read more and then read from 0 to the remaining number of elements.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid the 3rd case if we assume that:\r\n1. `docIds.length = k * buffer.length` where `k` is some natural positive number\r\n2. In all calls but the last, `length = docIds.length`\r\n3. In the last call `length` = remaining docs in the segment and therefore `buffer` will contain exactly `length` elements.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm introduce several not so trivial to analyze costs in Pinot's hotpath and contrary to my proposal, these changes will affect Pinot even when this customization is not used. In case we add something like that, I would be with Richard and I would require to add some benchmarks in order to hint whether the change may affect the performance negatively in some cases.\r\n\r\nContrary to this approach, mine is simpler (it doesn't change the current algorithm or invariants at all), it doesn't require to add the new concept of fetch size into the reader, it doesn't affect the performance on OSS Pinot and it doesn't close the door to the possibility of adding the fetch size to the reader in a future in case we find other interesting cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1455758280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1455832051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10255#issuecomment-1455832051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10255","id":1455832051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Wxjvz","user":{"login":"saurabhd336","id":7672118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzIxMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7672118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336","html_url":"https://github.com/saurabhd336","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saurabhd336/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-06T10:04:10Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T10:04:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Added

Here's the summary of the discussion (review feedback)\r\n1) Use callback/observer in the TableRebalancer class. The code to track the rebalance status + stats in Zookeeper will be encapsulated in the observer that'll be invoked from TableRebalancer. This also provides the flexibility of plugging in different types of observers. We will have 3 types of triggers for the Observer (Start of rebalance, external view to ideal state convergence, ideal state changes). \r\n2) Track the number of replicas to converge in addition to segments/partitions to converge\r\n3) Rename 'targetToIdealStateConvergence' to 'currentToTargetConvergence'

If some other index filters down to 100 rows, scanning a 100k+ cardinality dictionary is wasted work. If no other index can provide that filtering, and a query with a regex needs to be fast, the table config is suboptimal and the user should apply an FST index instead of Pinot optimising this predicate evaluator for full scans. However, if there were a filter context to indicate how selective the rest of the query is, this could be a good idea to improve the worst case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1462932810/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1462933089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10403#issuecomment-1462933089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10403","id":1462933089,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5XMpZh","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-09T22:49:39Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T23:07:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10403?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10403](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10403?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (2335f8d) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/221db828cf535eb751267124bca35c9a3b1f9c52?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (221db82) will **decrease** coverage by `1.99%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100.00%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10403      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.30%   68.32%   -1.99%     \n+ Complexity     6026     6020       -6     \n============================================\n  Files          2049     2049              \n  Lines        111060   111060              \n  Branches      16894    16894              \n============================================\n- Hits          78078    75877    -2201     \n- Misses        27518    29772    +2254     \n+ Partials       5464     5411      -53     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `24.37% <100.00%> (-0.23%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `67.89% <ø> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `13.88% <100.00%> (-0.03%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Start upsert quickstart - ` bin/quick-start-upsert-streaming.sh -dataDir $PWD/dataDirUpsert`\r\n\r\n2. Create a copy of `conf/pinot-server.conf`. Make the following changes to the new config file -\r\n```properties\r\npinot.cluster.name=QuickStartCluster\r\npinot.zk.server=localhost:2123\r\npinot.server.netty.port=8192\r\npinot.server.adminapi.port=8193\r\npinot.server.instance.dataDir=/some/local/dir/dataDirServer2\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Start a second server - `bin/pinot-admin.sh StartServer -configFileName /path/to/pinot-server-copy.conf`\r\n\r\n4. Assign a new tenant tag `upsertBugRepro_REALTIME` to this server from UI.\r\n\r\n5. Create the following table - \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"tableName\": \"upsertBugRepro\",\r\n  \"tableType\": \"REALTIME\",\r\n  \"segmentsConfig\": {\r\n    \"timeColumnName\": \"mtime\",\r\n    \"timeType\": \"MILLISECONDS\",\r\n    \"retentionTimeUnit\": \"DAYS\",\r\n    \"retentionTimeValue\": \"1\",\r\n    \"segmentPushType\": \"APPEND\",\r\n    \"segmentAssignmentStrategy\": \"BalanceNumSegmentAssignmentStrategy\",\r\n    \"schemaName\": \"upsertMeetupRsvp\",\r\n    \"replicasPerPartition\": \"1\",\r\n    \"replicaGroupStrategyConfig\": {\r\n      \"partitionColumn\": \"event_id\",\r\n      \"numInstancesPerPartition\": 1\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"tenants\": {\r\n    \"broker\": \"DefaultTenant\",\r\n    \"server\": \"upsertBugRepro\"\r\n   },\r\n  \"tableIndexConfig\": {\r\n    \"loadMode\": \"MMAP\",\r\n    \"streamConfigs\": {\r\n      \"streamType\": \"kafka\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.consumer.type\": \"lowLevel\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.topic.name\": \"upsertBugRepro\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.decoder.class.name\": \"org.apache.pinot.plugin.stream.kafka.KafkaJSONMessageDecoder\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.hlc.zk.connect.string\": \"localhost:2191/kafka\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.consumer.factory.class.name\": \"org.apache.pinot.plugin.stream.kafka20.KafkaConsumerFactory\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.zk.broker.url\": \"localhost:2191/kafka\",\r\n      \"stream.kafka.broker.list\": \"localhost:19092\",\r\n      \"realtime.segment.flush.threshold.size\": 2,\r\n      \"realtime.segment.flush.threshold.rows\": 2\r\n    },\r\n    \"segmentPartitionConfig\": {\r\n      \"columnPartitionMap\": {\r\n        \"event_id\": {\r\n          \"functionName\": \"Hashcode\",\r\n          \"numPartitions\": 2\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"fieldConfigList\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"location\",\r\n      \"encodingType\": \"RAW\",\r\n      \"indexType\": \"H3\",\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"resolutions\": \"5\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"metadata\": {\r\n    \"customConfigs\": {}\r\n  },\r\n  \"routing\": {\r\n    \"segmentPrunerTypes\": [\"partition\"],\r\n    \"instanceSelectorType\": \"strictReplicaGroup\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"upsertConfig\": {\r\n    \"mode\": \"FULL\",\r\n    \"enableSnapshot\" : true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Now publish records to the Kafka topic `upsertBugRepro` by connecting on `localhost:19092`\r\n7. Publish only 6 records. All records should be the same.\r\n8. Check the Pinot UI. Run `SELECT * FROM upsertBugRepro`. You should only receive one row in response.  Check for the number of segments in the UI as well.

I didn't iterate over all predicates to look for useful cases. In order to do not add features we may not use, I thought it would be better if we add them whenever we need them. But I can try to do it.\r\n\r\n> DataType visitor tests are not showing exactly how this will be useful yet.\r\n\r\nGiven that DataType is an enum, we can use a switch and DataTypeVisitor is not that useful. I'm using it in a situation where the code in the switch depends on some context, so I do something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nDataTypeVisitor<R> visitor;\r\nif (condition.is.fulfilled) {\r\n  visitor = new VisitorInCase1;\r\n} else {\r\n  visitor = new VisitorInCase2;\r\n}\r\nR result = dataType.accept(visitor)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I can use `Function` instead:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nFunction<DataType, R> fun;\r\nif (condition.is.fulfilled) {\r\n  fun = dt -> {\r\n    switch (dt) {\r\n      case INT: return X1;\r\n      case DOUBLE: return Y1;\r\n      default: return Z1;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n} else {\r\n  fun = dt -> {\r\n    switch (dt) {\r\n      case INT: return X2;\r\n      case DOUBLE: return Y2;\r\n      default: return Z2;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\nR result = fun.apply(dataType);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that the switch will not be protected by the compiler in case a new data type is added, but given that it isn't a very common change, I think I'm going to follow the second approach in order to create less confusion in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1467570156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1467761738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10183#issuecomment-1467761738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10183","id":1467761738,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5XfERK","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-14T09:51:43Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T09:51:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"* `index-spi-index-type-only` has been merged\r\n* `index-spi-index-service`, `index-spi-all-types` and `index-spi-remove-columnindextype` have been marked as ready to review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1467761738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1468123192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10274#issuecomment-1468123192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10274","id":1468123192,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Xgcg4","user":{"login":"abhijeetkushe","id":2093096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTMwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2093096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe","html_url":"https://github.com/abhijeetkushe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhijeetkushe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-14T13:39:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T13:39:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiangfu0  Our org does need to build a corretto imageJust wanted to see if I can help with story\r\nLooking at the README it looks like existing dockerfile already supports modifying the Java distribution \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pinot/tree/master/docker/images/pinot-base .If it is the case will i work if we just add another task for Corretto by passing env arg OPENJDK_IMAGE to [amazoncorretto](https://hub.docker.com/_/amazoncorretto).
