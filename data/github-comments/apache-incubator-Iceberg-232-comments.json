We won't be able to really write tests for the SparkPositionDeltaWrite until the SQL conf change is in because this PR just focuses on data frame write options\r\n\r\nI think to solve this, we should add back the Spark SQL session write config. The problem I raised in [my comment](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6651#discussion_r1101931339) was only a problem for the read option. If we remove the read session config then we can avoid it. But having the write config doesn't have the same issue (because writes automatically handle cases where the branch doesn't exist) and adding it back would allow us to run the tests.\r\n\r\n> 2.) Behavior of createOrReplaceTable when the branch write option is passed in. Say for example a user does the following:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> data.writeTo(\"prod.db.table\")\r\n>     .tableProperty(\"write.format.default\", \"orc\")\r\n>     .partitionedBy($\"level\", days($\"ts\"))\r\n>    .writeOption(SparkWriteOption.BRANCH, \"branch\")\r\n>     .createOrReplace()\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> What should the desired behavior be? Currently what happens is the write will be performed on branch and then if it's a replace the main table state will stay the same. So the `replace` loses its meaning. Another possible desired behavior is the branch is written to and replace will actually perform a replace branch to replace the head of main with the head of the target branch. This is what makes sense to me but I think it'll be hard to achieve this based on catalog/planner abstractions.\r\n\r\nI think the simplest answer is that we can just disallow `branch` with staged Spark tables. The branch should be passed through `LogicalWriteInfo` so we can disable this by adding a method to `StagedSparkTable` that is used for atomic create/replace:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public WriteBuilder newWriteBuilder(LogicalWriteInfo info) {\r\n    String branch = info.options().get(SparkWriteOptions.BRANCH);\r\n    if (branch != null && !branch.equalsIgnoreCase(SnapshotRef.MAIN_BRANCH)) {\r\n      throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\r\n          String.format(\"Cannot create or replace table with branch: %s\", branch));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return super.newWriteBuilder(info);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEventually, we may want to handle this case and decide on behavior. The `create`, `replace`, and `createOrReplace` methods in `DataFrameWriterV2` completely replace the table state, including the schema and partitioning. So the correct behavior for a branch is to add the new schema, partition spec, and properties, then create a new snapshot and set the branch state to that snapshot. This would be similar to the behavior in `TableMetadata.buildReplacement`, but slightly different because it would not need to set the table's current schema and partition spec, just the ones for the branch. We should definitely not handle this right away and should instead just disable it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1433928069/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1433966548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6651#issuecomment-1433966548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6651","id":1433966548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85VeJfU","user":{"login":"amogh-jahagirdar","id":87500546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTAwNTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87500546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar","html_url":"https://github.com/amogh-jahagirdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T01:26:32Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T01:26:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That makes sense @rdblue , we should just add back the SQL write config and that way we can cover all the write cases.

Firstly, thank you for your contributions.\r\n> \r\n> I wanted to ask you about your comment here about the GC overhead limit exceeded and your concern with having too many snapshots (which definitely is valid in general, though there are configurations to rewrite snapshots after a certain number and table maintenance operations to keep snapshots at a healthy amount of your needs). I'm hoping you can help me understand more your practices: how you're using the library to achieve this additional parallelism (is this via `.par` to make a Scala parallel collection with Spark, do you have custom code, is it just a configuration property you've raised)? Also, what catalog are you using and what filestore are you writing to? And also (important but I understand if it's not easy to answer right away), at what rate are you accumulating additional snapshots based on the your incoming data (maybe how many files do you have per snapshot in general)? And also, how often are you calling `AppendFile` per commit (as you mentioned `AppendFile` so I'm wondering if you're using the library a bit more directly or what).\r\n> \r\n> I know this isn't necessarily a small ask, but you've given a very thorough description here, and I'd really like to better understand the problems that you're seeing arise as well as your usage of the library. I think it would be really valuable.\r\n> \r\n> Anything you can provide, starting with the basics of:\r\n> \r\n> * system you're using for writing (eg Flink, Spark, Trino, etc),\r\n> * catalog you're using\r\n> * iceberg version you're using\r\n> * any non-default configuration values you're setting, particularly that would affect commit rate and snapshot production\r\n> \r\n> Also, ideally:\r\n> \r\n> * How are you achieving this added parallelism (a config value, high level code in your job, code that you've written using the Iceberg library, etc)\r\n> * If you've written your own code using the Java API, the relationship between commits and AppendaFile\r\n> \r\n> Anything you can share would greatly help in understanding your use case and the problems you're facing more. And there might be learnings to be had from your usage. 🙂\r\n> \r\n> Thanks, Kyle!\r\nBest regards, Kyle :)\r\n\r\nSo sorry too long to no reply. Thanks for you recommendations, it's a lesson has taken to my heart!\r\n\r\nAfter known more abort the code,  it's indeed a bad case to share a table in different threads.\r\nIt's the caller's responsibilities  NOT to do like that, to avoid generating a large amount staled `metadata` objects with Hive operations in a short time, leading to the pressure on JVM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1434622518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1434625639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3340#issuecomment-1434625639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3340","id":1434625639,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85VgqZn","user":{"login":"fengguangyuan","id":10569747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTY5NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10569747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/fengguangyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengguangyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T13:05:20Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T13:05:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I still do not get why you need to open a new transaction for each thread.
