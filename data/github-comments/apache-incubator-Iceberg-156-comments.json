It is a little concerning to me that the proposal for doing that is to use Hadoop's path normalization and then optionally ignore certain parts. Delegating that to Hadoop doesn't seem like a good idea to me, but it is at least a start.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly because we use Hadoop `FileSystem` for listing. If we use proprietary logic to normalize paths, this may lead to handling edge cases differently. Normalization mostly solves cosmetic issues in the path part of URIs, it does not solve the scheme and authority mismatch.\r\n\r\nI am happy to consider alternatives. In the future, we can customize `DeleteOrphanFiles` so that listing via `FileSystem` just becomes one way to build a list of actual files. For now, using Hadoop for normalization when we are doing listing via Hadoop seems reasonable to me.\r\n\r\n> I think we should also have strategies for this that depend on the file system scheme. s3 and s3a are essentially the same thing, but you can't ignore authority (bucket) for S3. HDFS may have different namenodes in the authority and whether they're equivalent depends on the Hadoop Configuration. I'd like to get more specific about the file systems that are supported and how each one will normalize and compare.\r\n\r\nThis is when it gets tricky. Hadoop conf in jobs that write to the table can be different from Hadoop conf in jobs that delete orphan files. Users can define arbitrary schemes or use different yet equivalent authorities.\r\n\r\nMaybe, the default values for the ignore options can depend on the scheme of the location we clean. For example, if the location we scan for orphan files starts with `s3`, we can ignore the scheme but have to compare the authority and normalized path.

for reviving this issue @aokolnychyi. I've been thinking if having relative paths will help in this case. In my [relative paths change](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2658), I have separated out table location into a prefix and a location. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"format-version\" : 2,\r\n  \"table-uuid\" : \"24f86bb2-3473-4352-b8fb-375a55b0267b\",\r\n  \"location\" : \"tbl\",\r\n  \"location-prefix\" : \"file:/var/folders/wr/q_40znsn3_b0n0hx08v15dzr0000gn/T/hive5023759931126715387/hivedb.db/\",\r\n  \"last-sequence-number\" : 2,\r\n  \"last-updated-ms\" : 1647492090039,\r\n  \"last-column-id\" : 1,\r\n  \"current-schema-id\" : 0,\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSimilarly, location is also split into prefix and location in the catalog with the ability to switch prefix with an API.\r\n\r\nWould this change help in the problem described here if we always pass a relative path in `location => '...' ` in the `remove_orphan_files()` call and let the scheme and authority come from `location-prefix` property above?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, having `ignore-*` makes sense to me. I also agree with @rdblue that we need to find consensus on which defaults apply to which schemes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1070352022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1070361464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4346#issuecomment-1070361464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4346","id":1070361464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_zGt4","user":{"login":"anuragmantri","id":13743212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzQzMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13743212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri","html_url":"https://github.com/anuragmantri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-17T06:12:21Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T06:12:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thinking

For Strings maybe this made sense ... but for ZSortInt 1,2,3,4 I would have expected things to take different amounts of times. Perhaps with a totally random layout of data the significant bits to compare on average always appear in the same location for ZOrder regardless of number of interleaved columns?

I think this is not trying to highjack the delete behavior. Based on what we've heard from some key customers, tagging an object is now the preferred S3 delete implementation in many companies. It is typically a sev0 in a corporation for data loss, so the data platform team prefers to gradually retire the delete files to different tiers and let S3 handle the lifecycle transition.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a discussion of table deletion/snapshot expiration with purge or not. For platforms that allow people to do table deletion with purge, I would imagine this feature to be preferred where users could accidentally run a DROP TABLE. And even for platform that does deletion without purge, eventually there is a team who does the \"purge\" part, and based on the customer discussions we have, this is typically what they do by tagging files and then define lifecycle policy so S3 takes care of the transition of files.\r\n\r\n> This also requires that the configuration of the bucket aligns with the tags to actually achieve the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nThis can be explained in 3 parts:\r\n\r\n1. ironically, to satisfy the use case i described, many teams today have to enable S3 object versioning to not hard-delete data files. However, it becomes a huge increase in cost and users have to implement custom workflows then to deal with versioned objects. So some sort of bucket configuration is always needed for enterprise data lake setup, and this tagged approach is going to save cost rather than increase cost for those users.\r\n\r\n2. there are many features that won't work with the default S3 behavior and need bucket level settings, some other features we plan to add like S3 acceleration mode, S3 dual stack are all like that. It's mostly done for backwards compatibility. We see a strong adoption of using a lifecycle policy to soft-delete data instead of doing a direct s3 object deletion. There are recently also threads in similar products like Hudi and Delta for such use cases. I would consider this feature to fall into such category of \"new features that users have to opt-in\" on S3 side.\r\n\r\n3. From Iceberg perspective, a file is no longer a part of the table if it is not a part of the Iceberg metadata tree. FileIO.delete is always used AFTER a table level commit that removes the file out of the metadata tree (in the full table deletion case it is also done after catalog operation that removes the table in catalog), so this semantic is still intact even if a file is not actually deleted for people would like to use such a feature.\r\n\r\n> Overall, it feels like this is a bit of a reach in terms of functionality.\r\n\r\nLet me know what do you think about this area of topic, if you have any better solutions than the proposed one. I think this is a small feature that could enable a lot of valuable use cases. Similar to the access point feature we are adding in S3FileIO, we consider that an intermediate solution which could be solved also at Iceberg level with larger spec change to support relative file path, I think there is value in offering this feature for people who knows how to use it, while we think of anything better that could solve such retention at Iceberg spec level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073306515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073347947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4342#issuecomment-1073347947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4342","id":1073347947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_-f1r","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-20T21:00:52Z","updated_at":"2022-03-20T21:00:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danielcweeks, @jackye1995, I think there's definitely value in being able to add tags to let lifecycle policies handle this. But I find it really confusing that adding a delete tag prevents the object from being deleted and instead just tags it.\r\n\r\nI think that tagging an object before deleting it and skipping the delete because the tag takes care of it should be separate configurations. It's reasonable for someone to replace deletes with tags, or tag an object and still delete it. I can also imagine a situations where client-side deletes aren't allowed and the warehouse relies on an orphan files service. That means all of the combinations of \"skip delete\" and \"tag before delete\" are valid use cases, so we should separate those.\r\n\r\nHow about implementing this with a `s3.delete-enabled` flag and the `s3.delete.tags` config?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073347947/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073349996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4262#issuecomment-1073349996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4262","id":1073349996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_-gVs","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-20T21:12:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-20T21:12:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @dramaticlly!

That makes all the implementations simpler.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073351526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073360434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4366#issuecomment-1073360434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4366","id":1073360434,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_-i4y","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-20T22:21:21Z","updated_at":"2022-03-20T22:21:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing, @danielcweeks!

However, should it be `s3.delete-enabled`, or a broader `io.delete-enabled` feature? If a client-side delete is not allowed, it should be applied to all the FileIOs instead of just S3.\r\n\r\nI thought about the 4 possible combinations, and I did not ask for an additional `-enabled` flag because:\r\n1. delete enabled + tags set: this case does not really exist, because once the object is deleted in S3 there is no tag anymore.\r\n2. delete disabled + tags set: this is the feature in the PR\r\n3. delete enabled + no tag: this is the existing behavior\r\n4. delete disabled + no tag: this is the case we agree that an orphan file service would take care of everything, and goes back to my question of should this be a feature flag across all FileIOs?

So you could use a tag to control when the old version gets cleaned up, but logically delete it immediately. Isn't that a valid case?\r\n\r\nFor the question about `s3.delete-enabled` or `io.delete-enabled`, I would go with `s3.delete-enabled` although I could be convinced otherwise.\r\n\r\nFirst, if the intent is to replace the S3 delete with a tag operation instead, then it seems like you wouldn't want to disable deletes across all storage for a table. If you have files stored across multiple schemes, then it doesn't make sense to disable deletes for other schemes.\r\n\r\nSecond, `io.delete-enabled` would address just use case 4. In that case, why delegate to `FileIO` to skip the delete rather than just not calling delete in the library? I don't think we would want `io.delete-enabled` because it would be impossible to make sure all of the `FileIO` implementations implement it consistently. Plus, you'd still have the problem where you probably don't want to turn it on in all object stores at once. You may have a different orphan file cleanup procedure for each one, or maybe for one you don't have a reliable prefix to list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073369730/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1073437238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4364#issuecomment-1073437238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4364","id":1073437238,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX84_-1o2","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-21T03:05:44Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T03:05:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It
