Might be a temp issue.\n\nAlso, could you update the title of the PR to reflect what is changed? Something like \"Change the variable s_logger to non-static and fixed its name\" or similar. That way we can more easily see what the change was about.\n\nDid you try a non-redist build? If so, please post result. \n\nFinally, it seems there is a conflict now. Could you rebase against latest master please?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/137924348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/137928384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/765#issuecomment-137928384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/765","id":137928384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzkyODM4NA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-05T08:12:39Z","updated_at":"2015-09-05T08:12:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-analysis #441](https://builds.apache.org/job/cloudstack-pull-analysis/441/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/137928384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/137928719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/775#issuecomment-137928719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/775","id":137928719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzkyODcxOQ==","user":{"login":"nitin-maharana","id":12583725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgzNzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12583725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana","html_url":"https://github.com/nitin-maharana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-05T08:23:36Z","updated_at":"2015-09-05T08:23:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, we can create domain name with special character.\n\nPreviously the '%' symbol was considered as a wild character.
