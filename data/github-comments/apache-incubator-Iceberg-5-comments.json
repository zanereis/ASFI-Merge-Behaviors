Thanks for the tips that TestParquetWrite can reproduce. By adding a gc to the end of that test, I was able to reliably reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem was caused by `CloseableIterable.combine`. That method copied the list of closeables immediately, instead of referencing the original queue where the closeables were added as the scan progressed. I've replaced that with a `CloseableIterable.concat` operation that closes the iterables more quickly, as they are exhausted. I also updated `ParallelIterable` to do the same, so now manifests are closed after tasks finish instead of at the end of scan planning. This should be better for resource use.\r\n\r\nI also confirmed that I no longer see the unclosed stream warning for either code path (parallel or single-threaded).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/479639244/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/479640536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/150#issuecomment-479640536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/150","id":479640536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTY0MDUzNg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T20:10:52Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T20:10:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi, @prodeezy, this is another fix for #104.

can you take another look? I've fixed the problem you found and validated there are tests that actually exercise case insensitive binding for the Parquet classes.\r\n\r\nTo your question about how to reproduce this, you have to run a query that pushes filters down to Parquet. The filters you use can't be satisfied by partition filtering because Iceberg will drop those filters and won't push them down. I would recommend writing a dataset without partitioning and sorted by a categorical value, then test equality filters on that categorical value.

Contributors verify the performance impact of their fixes/improvements by running a particular benchmark with and without their change.\r\n2. Users run benchmarks to try out Iceberg and see how it compares to the built-in Spark file source.\r\n3. Committers run these benchmarks before every release to see the performance difference and prevent any degradation.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to support option 3 but I believe we are far from this. Instead, we can try to focus on a generic framework for option 1/2. Ideally, we should be able to use it locally as well as on existing data sets (e.g., point to a dataset in HDFS).\r\n\r\nI agree the file skipping benchmarks are bit controversial. The main idea was to show that Iceberg doesn't touch irrelevant files and boosts the performance for highly selective queries. However, these benchmarks would make more sense on real data. So, we can either remove the file skipping benchmarks completely or just try to make them generic enough so that users can also run them on real datasets.\r\n\r\nIt definitely makes sense to have a benchmark for Parquet readers alone. That would be a fair comparison. However, I think it is still useful to see the end-to-end performance, which covers a lot of aspects. For example,  the read/write path for Spark Data Source V2 can be a bit slower. We need to catch such things and fix them.\r\n\r\nExcluding the results makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n@danielcweeks @prodeezy @rdblue, it would be really great to hear your opinion on how we see the future of such benchmarks. If we decide to have them, I will update the PR.

Today, Presto works with Hive 1.x and 2.x, and we have no plans to drop support for older versions. \r\n\r\nPresto does not yet support Hive 3.x due to backwards incompatible changes around transactional tables, bucketing, security, and timestamps. It seems that Hive 3.x is actually incompatible with every other tool in the ecosystem, including older Hive versions. Spark support seems to be implemented by running the queries in HiveServer2 (rather than native Spark).\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why we (Presto developers and community) are so excited about Iceberg is that it frees users from the unwritten convention for Hive tables and provides a strong specification that all the tools in the ecosystem can implement. I'm also personally excited about the ability to replace the metastore with DynamoDB or similar, allowing users to run queries over data stored in cloud object stores without any additional dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/486059290/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/486725417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/166#issuecomment-486725417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/166","id":486725417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjcyNTQxNw==","user":{"login":"manishmalhotrawork","id":22434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM0MDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork","html_url":"https://github.com/manishmalhotrawork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishmalhotrawork/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T15:37:24Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T15:37:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@electrum thanks a lot !\r\n\r\ntrying to put together my understanding, thanks for the patience.\r\n\r\nPresto master is using [Hive 3.x](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/master/pom.xml#L426)\r\nBut it's not ready to use, for the reasons you mentioned above.\r\nAnd I believe same thing will be true for Iceberg plugin for now.\r\n\r\nSo, to use Iceberg from Presto:\r\nUse Presto-sql release - tag-300, was the last release using [Hive 1.x](https://github.com/prestosql/presto/blob/300/pom.xml#L410), so that should be used ?\r\nand, once Iceberg is good with Hive 1.x, we should use that and use from Presto-Iceberg plugin.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/486725417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/486738633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/166#issuecomment-486738633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/166","id":486738633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjczODYzMw==","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T16:12:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T16:12:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@electrum Can you please provide more details on the dependency between Hive and Parquet version in Presto?
