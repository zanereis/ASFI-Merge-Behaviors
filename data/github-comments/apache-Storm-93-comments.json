The current code seems to increase the size of max-spout-pending if the number of fully acked tuples is increasing, and reduces it if the number appears to be decreasing.  Why do we bother with this at all?  If we just set the max spout pending to a large enough number we will get the same result.\n\nThe reason behind having a max-spout-pending is so we don't blow the java heap, by having too many messages in flight at any point in time, and balance the throughput with the latency.  If we have more messages in flight the latency will go up, but the throughput increases.  If we have fewer in flight the latency is much lower but the throughput is also lower.\n\nI would really prefer to see a solution where a user can set a latency target, ideally 95th percentile or 99th percentile target and the spout adjusts the max-spout-pending to try and hit that latency target, with an upper bound on max-spout-pending so we don't overflow the heap.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/122081360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/122082381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/583#issuecomment-122082381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/583","id":122082381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjA4MjM4MQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-16T20:34:29Z","updated_at":"2015-07-16T20:34:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n@dossett do you want to file a JIRA for this?
