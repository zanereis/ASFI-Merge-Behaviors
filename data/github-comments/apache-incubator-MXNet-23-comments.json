Memory: with the same image size of 512px, Lua version takes 2868MB memory while mxnet takes 1498MB. It makes mxnet unique advantages that, laptop users can try neural art because most laptop has <2GB GPU memory, also mxnet can train larger pictures on my poor man's GTX 960 4 GB, where 800px can easily core-dump the Lua version.\n2. speed: Lua version took 232 seconds on my poor man's GTX 960 (1000 iterations) while mxnet takes 93 seconds for converging into a similar result in 200 iterations. Not sure if there will be a simplified model for less time. Also, mxnet loads a much smaller model file, although it is the same caffe model.\n3. tricks of having better outputs. the default denoise factor `remove-noise` is too large which makes the picture looks blur, a better value is about 0.15 instead of 0.2 . `stop-eps` value needs to be a little bit smaller for a stronger style, e.g. 0.004 or 0.003, but it may take longer time to converge. Set `content-weight` to 20 instead of 10 keeps more content shape, otherwise the style is so strong that distort the original content.\n\nHere it is the same cat `pogo` with Van Gogh:\n<img width=\"512\" alt=\"pogo-vangogh-mxnet\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1690881/11481189/c40ceb24-9750-11e5-8c7a-fc46c4ac675c.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/160727292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/160732857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/664#issuecomment-160732857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/664","id":160732857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDczMjg1Nw==","user":{"login":"antinucleon","id":1258974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1258974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon","html_url":"https://github.com/antinucleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-30T19:26:52Z","updated_at":"2015-11-30T19:26:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@phunterlau Guess we can make a cool blog about your finding and post in reddit or other place.

The example is [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/numpy-ops/numpy_softmax.py).\n- If you are a python guy and do not want to touch C++ side, you could use MXNet RTC. The example is [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/numpy-ops/ndarray_softmax.py). (Well, you still need to know how to write GPU codes).\n- If you have your own c++ implementation.
