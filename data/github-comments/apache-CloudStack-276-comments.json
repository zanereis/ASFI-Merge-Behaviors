Just so I get a feeling for the test failures with regards to other PRs: Are other PRs failing with issues that don't seem directly related to them?\r\n\r\nWith regards to my progress running the managed-storage tests, I'm about 1/3 of the way through.\r\n\r\nSo far, I only see one failure. It is possibly related to commit 1d0f212. The problem concerns SAN-assisted snapshots. This is when we take a SAN snapshot, but we don't want to keep the snapshot on the SAN, so we migrate it to secondary storage (the idea here is to minimize the impact on the source volume that we are taking a volume snapshot on by not copying from that volume to secondary storage, but rather going through a SAN snapshot).\r\n\r\nIn any event, we can't create a template from this kind of snapshot anymore because we can't find a hypervisor host to perform the copy from secondary to primary storage.\r\n\r\nI have this noted and plan to investigate it soon. In the meanwhile, I've just continued running the tests and all has been well with them.\r\n\r\nOnce I have all of the tests run, I can post results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/356481529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/356481562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2298#issuecomment-356481562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2298","id":356481562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQ4MTU2Mg==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T02:33:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T02:33:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<b>Trillian
