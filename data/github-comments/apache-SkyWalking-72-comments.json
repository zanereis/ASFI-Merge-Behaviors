luck you :P. That's okay though. I'm sure this isn't ready yet. I wanted to ask you if I was doing the `EntrySpan`/`ExitSpan` pattern correctly for the event bus.\r\n\r\nBasically, when you send a message through the event bus it could be going to another computer or it could be going to a consumer on the same computer. So there is a chance that it could be a message which is sent on the same-thread, cross-thread, or cross-process. My question is:\r\n - should I be detecting if the message was same-thread, cross-thread, or cross-process and build the appropriate span based on that?\r\n\r\nShould I have logic like:\r\n```\r\nIf it was sent cross-thread:\r\n - Ignore ContextCarrier and work with ContextSnapshot\r\n\r\nIf it was sent cross-process\r\n - Use ContextCarrier\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently sending a message always creates an `ExitSpan` and sends the `ContextCarrier` and receiving a message always creates a `EntrySpan` using the `ContextCarrier` sent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/474650413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/474657799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2378#issuecomment-474657799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2378","id":474657799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDY1Nzc5OQ==","user":{"login":"restoreall","id":19926324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI2MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19926324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall","html_url":"https://github.com/restoreall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/restoreall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-20T02:20:29Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T02:20:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Auth?
