Using absolute path is definitely a better idea to fix this bug once for all. It was a bad way to use relative path in #10208. Somehow at that time I thought there was a line of code like `cd ${workDir}` in the script by mistake.

Do you guys have any goods suggestions for the new api' path? For example using ```/v2``` to distinguish it from the old api.\r\n\r\n2. Currently we use ```{code: 0, msg: \"成功\", data: {}, failed: false, success: true}``` as our api's response structure. I suggest remove meaningless ```failed``` and ```success``` and use ```code``` to judge success or failed.

1. Do you guys have any goods suggestions for the new api' path? For example using `/v2` to distinguish it from the old api.\r\n> 2. Currently we use `{code: 0, msg: \"成功\", data: {}, failed: false, success: true}` as our api's response structure. I suggest remove meaningless `failed` and `success` and use `code` to judge success or failed.
