for the splitIntoBundles you use token range from -2^63 to 2^63 but these values are for Cassandra Murmur3Partitioner partitioner. This is the default Cassandra v1.2+ but it can be changed by the user to RandomPartitioner, ... in that case the values for the ranges won't be the same. IMHO, it might be better rather than using absolute values, to read all the token ranges in system.size_estimates table in fields rangeStart and rangeEnd. That way ranges it will be dynamic. But that system table is only available in Cassandra v2.1.5+.
