Even if we're saying that they are just counts, then adding them up still doesn't make sense either, or rather is quite questionable.\r\nFor example, if you had a run with parallelism=2, then both sources would emit 1, 2, 3, ... ,X and 1, 2, 3, ... ,Y respectively, but when you restore with parallelism=1 the source would continue from X + Y. I have a very hard time figuring out a use-case where this makes sense.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this PR since changing this example (if we really decide to do it) goes beyond the scope of a hotfix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/439022147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/439023607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6594#issuecomment-439023607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6594","id":439023607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTAyMzYwNw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T12:27:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T12:27:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The test failure is likely just an instability in the kafka test, feel free to ignore it for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/439023607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/439025232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7080#issuecomment-439025232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7080","id":439025232,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTAyNTIzMg==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T12:33:54Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T12:33:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The issue was resolved in jira ticket.
