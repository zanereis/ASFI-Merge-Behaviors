would like to have pulsar clusters in two data centers. They are active and active. And we would like to replicate messages from one site to the other. i.e. the subscriber from one site will receive messages from publishers at two sites. And no message loss. If one site is down, the other site can continue to work. \r\nWe are thinking of geo replication. But since geo replication is asynchronous, we are worried about message loss. Every single message cannot be lost.  \r\nThen we are thinking to have synchronous replication, at bookkeeper level, cross two sites. First difficulty is there is no examples of how to do it without global zookeeper. If we use local clusters to manage each site, we need a global configuration store to manage two sites information which becomes a single point failure. If we use global zookeeper, one zookeeper for two sites, due to zookeeper cluster has to be 2*n+1 nodes, it means if the site with n+1 node fails, the other site also stops working.\r\nIs my understanding right? Is there a possible solution with Pulsar for us? Thanks.
