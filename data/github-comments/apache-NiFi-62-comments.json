My question is about the logging for that code path.  You log an error on line 150 when a flowfile is routed to not_found, and I'm asking if you believe not_found is \"bad enough\" to deserve an error.  It seems possible that it is a perfectly normal occurrence that keys are not found in the table, and the flowfile would be routed to not_found without any worries.  As you point out, the user can choose to treat not_found separately from failure, or not, as they choose.  But it is logged as an error regardless of their choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/316268819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/316268900","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2012#issuecomment-316268900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2012","id":316268900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjI2ODkwMA==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T04:24:25Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T04:24:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm OK with the name \"GetRethinkDB\".

web service to download files with something like:\r\nHandleHttpRequest -> ControlNiFiComponent -failure-> HandleHttpResponse\r\nGetHDFS -> HandleHttpResponse\r\nThis way, a user could send a HTTP request with the path of the file to download, the ControlNiFiComponent is used to start/stop the GetHDFS processor with the path to set in the processor, and the file is sent back to the

This is to cover cases where node identities may not be present in LDAP\r\n\r\n2) Using mapped identities to ensure that user-group associations would still be properly resolved\r\n\r\n3) Using the Composite Configurable User Group Provider to allow maintenance of node identities and groups in NiFi while allowing policies to be enforced via Ranger\r\n\r\nAll three scenarios worked well with an established cluster. I was able to go from one scenario to the next through changing configurations, updating policies and restarting without issue. However a bug was encountered on the third test case when I wanted to add a new node to the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe process of adding a new node requires that no information that would seed the users.xml file be  provided in configurations (e.g. Initial Admin, Node Identifiers, etc). Therefore the expectation is once the node attempts to join the cluster it would receive the necessary user information from the cluster to create it's own local version of the file.  When using the ManagedRangerAuthorizer along with the Configurable provider it doesn't appear to have that functionality, since the users.xml generated was empty.  This led to the node starting up fine however when attempting to access the UI from any node a proxy error occurred. Given the users.xml file was empty this error made sense because NiFi was unable to determine the users (node identities) or groups they should be mapped to, hence unable to apply the Ranger policy that allowed the nodes group to perform proxying. \r\n\r\nIn speaking with @mcgilman offline this error was due to the ManagedRangerAuthorizer not extracting user group information for cases when it's paired with configurable user group providers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317130280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317135265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2020#issuecomment-317135265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2020","id":317135265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzEzNTI2NQ==","user":{"login":"cammachusa","id":28015823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDE1ODIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28015823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa","html_url":"https://github.com/cammachusa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cammachusa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T23:34:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T23:34:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @joewitt , there is a sandbox that has Kudu instance (and related components) that you can quickly spin up a VM and test the processor. https://kudu.apache.org/docs/quickstart.html\r\nIn case you need something diff, I can also provision an AWS's VM with KuDu installed and give you the access?\r\nBtw, can you find me a second reviewer?\r\nThanks,\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317135265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317172092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1972#issuecomment-317172092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1972","id":317172092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzE3MjA5Mg==","user":{"login":"peter-gergely-horvath","id":15800802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODAwODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15800802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-gergely-horvath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-gergely-horvath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-22T09:55:13Z","updated_at":"2017-07-22T09:55:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jvwing I have reworked the changes according to your recommendations: I think the current state is indeed cleaner, more robust and retains backwards API compatibility.

I understand the original reason for this work was to be in line with the `PostHTTP` processor, but this makes outgoing connections to remote services, which may be legacy systems that do not support new TLS protocol versions. While I would discourage integrating with those systems as well, as `SSLv3` provides little effective security at this point, we are not exposing a vulnerability in NiFi by supporting that protocol version. \r\n\r\nJetty intentionally disables any protocol version below `TLSv1.2`, and thus we require any incoming connections to support this protocol version. I believe the proper solution here is to remove `SSLv2` and `SSLv3` (along with `TLSv1` and `TLSv1.1`) from the dropdown list of the `SSLContextService` when used for *listening* (i.e. accepting incoming connections) as they will not be supported, rather than throwing an exception if an invalid one is selected (by my count, 5 of the 7 available are invalid for incoming connections -- `SSL`, `SSLv2Hello`, `SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, and `TLSv1.1`; `TLS` and `TLSv1.2` are valid).

In my basic testing, it deleted objects from RethinkDB just fine.  I have a few questions about the **Return old Changes from the delete** option, and how it is processed.  I am not very familiar with RethinkDB, so I had to check the [delete docs](https://rethinkdb.com/api/java/delete/) on how it works.  I have no practical experience using this option.\r\n\r\n* Instead of a true/false dropdown list, you made this a free text field supporting expression language.  May I ask why?  I think it would be easier to edit if we did, and easier to understand if we made the options more explanatory (\"Capture changes as FlowFile content\", \"Do not capture changes\", or something like that).\r\n* If the option is true, the processor writes the changes to the attribute `rethinkdb.delete.changes`, the changes are also contained in the entire raw `attribute rethinkdb.delete.result` attribute, and finally the changes are written to the flowfile content.

Previous to this PR and confirmed by @alopresto and @trkurc, the protocol used by ListenHTTP was automatically negotiated with the client and the configured SSLContextService protocol was ignored. Since the fact that this is misleading and in an effort to not change processor communications behavior, i decided to stop the processor on startup if an invalid protocol was selected and log that the protocol selected wasn't supported with a recommendation to choose another -- this is evident from the screenshot i posted above. As pointed out, this will cause processors to break if they were configured with SSLv3, for example, prior to this change. Additionally, I didn't want to change the global list of selectable protocols in SSLContextService if only one (or a few) processor(s) impacted that list. That's why i attempted to localize the restriction to the one processor.\r\n\r\nSo instead of breaking the processor if the SSLContextService is configured with a protocol that isn't supported by ListenHTTP, i see 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. If the SSLContextService is configured with something that ListenHTTP doesn't support, override the protocol to (possibly configured) TLSv1.2 since that's what it was doing previously and log a warning indicating that this happened. \r\n2. Build another SSLContextService in which a processor can inform which protocols should be selectable.\r\n\r\nThe second is a bit of work and perhaps outside the scope of this issue, but i'm happy to do whatever is recommended.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317744439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317782054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2036#issuecomment-317782054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2036","id":317782054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzc4MjA1NA==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-25T15:50:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T15:50:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317782054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317783940","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2036#issuecomment-317783940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2036","id":317783940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzc4Mzk0MA==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-25T15:56:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T15:56:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1,

thoughts on this thread.  First it is good to get this cleaned up and easier for the user so this is a great discussion.\r\n\r\n1. It sounds prudent that we delineate our SSLContextService along two lines.  One is StandardSSLContextService which works as our current one does, supports numerous protocols including those we do not recommend be in continued use but that we need to support for interacting/initiating connections to systems using legacy protocols.  The other would be a more restricted/conservative set of protocols like TLSv1.2.  I recommend we call that RestrictedSSLContextService.  We can document on the existing Standard service what it is for and allowable for.  And we can do the same on restricted indicating it is only for 'safe' protocols and may evolve as more is learned/made available.  Both would follow the same interface most likely.\r\n2. We update ListenHTTP,HandleRequest,(any proc that acts as a listen/server) to allow only the RestrictedSSLContextService.  This is within the documented transition changes between minor versions, can be captured in our release/migration notes, and will improve the user experience to only accept allowed protocols.\r\n3.  We should avoid to the extent possible ever doing validation of a given configuration of a component/processor only once started.  And we should avoid using onScheduled to block startup/etc..  Once a user is passed the validation phase this is what process yielding is for.  The logic to test whether the protocols used, which would not matter if (1) and (2) above are done, should be done as early in the lifecycle as possible to let the user resolve the issue before we slap their hand by stopping their process (and that is only when considering this done in a non-programmatic case).  I realize this isn't purely clear all the time but am saying this from an intent of the API, thinking about when we bind validation issues, and considering that the API is for both programmatic and human interaction.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317802785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/317826515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2003#issuecomment-317826515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2003","id":317826515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzgyNjUxNQ==","user":{"login":"Wesley-Lawrence","id":2752219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTIyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2752219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/Wesley-Lawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wesley-Lawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-25T18:26:10Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T18:26:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14
