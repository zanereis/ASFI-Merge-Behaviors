feature is needed in some plugins:\r\n1. You can check the `JDBCDriverInterceptor#afterMethod`, need to create a `SWConnection` to replace the old one for keeping the connect-url.\r\n1. This Kafka plugin( released in future ), the message is a byte array, which returns by a serializer. In order to keep the trace's cross-process continuation, agent must add a ContextCarrier into the byte array. So we must have the capability to change it.\r\n\r\nAlthough we had took this risk into consideration, so since 3.2, we let the enhanced class implement `EnhancedInstance` interface and a dynamic field to carry extra info. By supporting this, we can avoid to alter return value in most cases, but not all of them, such as kafka plugin.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute or develop a new plugin, please make sure altering return value just is necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd a final thing, sky-walking agent didn't ask the application developers to change their source code manually, but the changing is still be done in runtime. So risks of breaking application always exist, we must do these carefully.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/314987587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/315076472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/287#issuecomment-315076472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/287","id":315076472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTA3NjQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T13:24:12Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T13:24:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this issue.

Application instance id, Allocated by collector, @pengys5 . Most likely a short or integer is enough. Let's do the math. First we assume that the backend allocates new id with no reuse mechanism. Even we have 1,000 applications, each one of them has (avg) 50 instances, there cost 50, 000 application ids in every reboot. Reboot the cluster in every two days, (either excellent DevOps team or disaster product), the max application instance id is 18,250,000 ( Far from MAX_INT, 2,147,483,647 ). \r\n1.  Thread id. Allocated by JVM, in theory, it could be a very big long, but actually, if you application is high performance, most likely you use a thread pool, instead of creating new thread in every time. So in this case, the id will not be too large. most likely between 1 and 30000, ( A short only )\r\n1. timestamp + [0-9999] seq, definitely a long.\r\n\r\nSo in protobuf, the id is 1 short/int + 1 short + 1 long, which is 12 - 14 bytes. Much less than before.\r\n\r\nAnd in cross-process propagation, mostly HTTP head, we use BASE64 for each part of id. \r\n1. '#' + 4 chars for short\r\n1. '$' + 8 chars for int\r\n1. 12 chars for long\r\n\r\nSo the id in BASE64 used 22, 26 or 29 chars.\r\ne.g.\r\n1. (instId)1280 + (threadId)2000 + (timestamp + seq)15006041906190932, base64 is `#AAU=#0Ac=VJpNZepPNQA=`, 22 chars.\r\n1.
