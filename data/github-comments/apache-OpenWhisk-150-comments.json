\r\nSorry for joining late in this discussion. \r\nIn my last year I have implemented the SPIs for plugging in alternative Authentication and Entitlement providers in Openwhisk. My strong suggestion would be to place any additional code checking for entitlement (in this case: the entitlement to delete entities) into the existing entitlement SPI implementation.\r\nAlternative entitlement implementations (like the one I have implemented for IBM cloud functions) might prevent accidental deletion in other ways like configuring user or user group specific polices \r\nin a policy system. They have no need of  additional protection. \r\nOf course the default entitlement provider would benefit from a mechanism like the one you proposed. By moving the functionality in the Entitelemnt-SPI the functionality could be added to the default path, but would not interfere with alternative entitlement implementations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/458108322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/458112524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4058#issuecomment-458112524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4058","id":458112524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODExMjUyNA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T12:27:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T12:27:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mhenke1 Are the alternatives you've implemented something that is planned for open source contribution?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/458112524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/458115617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4058#issuecomment-458115617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4058","id":458115617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODExNTYxNw==","user":{"login":"mhenke1","id":15377852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc3ODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15377852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1","html_url":"https://github.com/mhenke1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhenke1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T12:37:29Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T12:37:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rabbah I would love to.
