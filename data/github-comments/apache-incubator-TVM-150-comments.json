I am also writing test cases in test_forward.py(for tensorflow) which compares tvm output with tensorflow output. I want to know is there any specific reason why you have not added any changes in test_forward.py(comparing tvm with tf) for unit testing?? Should i ignore this file altogether?\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nDeepak Babel","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/567348908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/567382821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3879#issuecomment-567382821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3879","id":567382821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzM4MjgyMQ==","user":{"login":"kice","id":3945950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDU5NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3945950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice","html_url":"https://github.com/kice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-19T08:10:30Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T08:10:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\nvoid CodeGenCUDA::VisitExpr_(const Cast* op, std::ostream& os) { \r\n  bool fromHalf =\r\n      op->value.type().is_float() && op->value.type().bits() == 16 && op->value.type().lanes() == 1;\r\n  bool toint8 = (op->type.is_int() || op->type.is_uint()) && op->type.bits() == 8 && op->type.lanes() == 1;\r\n  if (fromHalf && toint8) {\r\n    std::stringstream value_16;\r\n    std::stringstream value_int8;\r\n    this->PrintExpr(op->value, value_16);\r\n    auto inter_type = op->type.is_int() ?
