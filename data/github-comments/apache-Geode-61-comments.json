Certainly on the current develop branch, any older version of Geode will cause problems if a Lucene query is attempted, but once 1.15.0 has been released, there should be no problem with rolling from 1.15.0 to a newer version, providing the Lucene version hasn't changed again. It might be better to instead check that there is no member older than the version in which Lucene was updated (1.15.0, assuming we don't cut the release branch before these changes are merged). I understand that this would be more work, and would mean that RollingUpgrade tests would become more complex, as they'd have to cover both the failing and passing cases, but if you agree that there would be value in only preventing Lucene queries when we know there's a potential problem rather than the more blunt approach currently used, then I'd appreciate the change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/833804895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/833912783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6444#issuecomment-833912783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6444","id":833912783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzkxMjc4Mw==","user":{"login":"pivotal-eshu","id":11180099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgwMDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11180099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu","html_url":"https://github.com/pivotal-eshu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T22:24:58Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T22:25:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Looks good!

It is important that we are close to the right size in order for rebalancing to work properly, however the exact value is not important. These changes make the size for sets and hashes be within 5% of the size measured by using reflection. The accuracy changes as you add entries, and as entries get larger, because of the way that hashes, sets, and ByteArrayWrappers get resized. As we fill up the hash and set, we become more accurate in our estimation of the size. When full, the next entry added causes the structure to be resized, which means that our data now only accounts for a portion of the total size of the structure. We could have kept track of the resizes that happen in order to be even more accurate in our estimations, but doing so would add computational overhead for adding each key, and for each field at that key. It was decided that the benefits do not outweigh the cost.\r\n\r\nRedisHash and RedisSet both use constants to account for the overheads of:\r\n- an empty (RedisHash/RedisSet)\r\n- an empty (HashMap/HashSet) within the (RedisHash/RedisSet)\r\n- each member in the (hash/set)\r\nRedisHash also has an overhead for the first value in the hash.\r\nWe decided to use constants in the RedisData classes in order to reduce the number of calculations we have to do every time we add a new key. The math used to derive those constants live in the RedisSetTest and RedisHashTest classes. The tests of the constants will fail if the internal implementation of the classes changes. If the overheads decrease, then the constants need to be updated to reflect that. If the overheads increase, think through the changes before adding to the overhead. Significant changes to RedisSet or RedisHash could potentially break the math, so be sure to check where the problem is, in case we need to change the calculations.\r\nThere is a magical +5 in RedisSetTest.perMemberOverheadConstant_shouldMatchCalculatedValue. We think it came from the resizing, and that 5 happens to work ok, even though it should be dynamically calculated. But as previously said, the benefits do not outweigh the cost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/834729967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/834735135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6447#issuecomment-834735135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6447","id":834735135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNDczNTEzNQ==","user":{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-07T19:55:07Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T19:55:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> It doesn't look like `KeysNativeRedisAcceptanceTest` or `ScanNativeRedisAcceptanceTest` got switched over to use the `NativeRedisClusterTestRule`.

The case if following:\r\n\r\n   1. Configure partition region on multiple servers\r\n   2. Run traffic with puts\r\n   3.  Stop one of the servers and then perform \"rebalance\" operation (this is also done while traffic is running)\r\n\r\nIn this case running servers will become owners of the buckets from the member that has been shut down. In this case events are enqueued in temporary queue (bucketToTempQueue) while server is performing \"Get Initial Image\" (GII) operation from primary server. This current solution breaks this design base behavior, because it doesn't store events in temporary queue during this period of GII. The problem with solution is following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            } else if (!prQ.getColocatedWithRegion().getRegionAdvisor().getBucketOwners(bucketId)\r\n                .contains(prQ.getCache().getMyId())) {\r\n              if (isDebugEnabled) {\r\n                logger.debug(\r\n                    \"ParallelGatewaySenderOrderedQueue not putting key {} : Value : {} as bucket is not hosted locally.\",\r\n                    key, value);\r\n              }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`getColocatedWithRegion().getRegionAdvisor().getBucketOwners(bucketId) `- code only returns primary server ID during GII process, and not the server that it copying the bucket and taking ownership over the secondary the bucket.\r\n\r\nSorry for missing this case. I will try to find different solution.

welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/846037604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/846192551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6505#issuecomment-846192551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6505","id":846192551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjE5MjU1MQ==","user":{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-21T19:22:47Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T19:22:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the
