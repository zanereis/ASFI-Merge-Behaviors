I though of having a brand new extra button \"Run Selection\" that would be disabled when not selected, but with potentially \"Run Query\" and \"Run Async\" already, that multiplies the buttons to 4 buttons (+\"Run Selection Async\").\n\nI think changing the button text only is too subtle. We need something very clear and perhaps more discoverable, though as it is currently (with the color) I feel like a user would discover the feature quite quickly, most likely in its first heavy session of usage.\n\nI've seen UI features that will have a temporary \"flash\" to draw attention that something has changed, away from the action trigger, and go back to its final state quickly. An example of that type of UX would be if you add a TableElement, we could make its background yellow, fading back to default color over 3-5 seconds.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/257941517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/257941736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1517#issuecomment-257941736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1517","id":257941736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Nzk0MTczNg==","user":{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T17:40:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T17:40:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/257941736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/257944140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1479#issuecomment-257944140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1479","id":257944140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Nzk0NDE0MA==","user":{"login":"ascott","id":130878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott","html_url":"https://github.com/ascott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T17:48:34Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T17:48:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i
