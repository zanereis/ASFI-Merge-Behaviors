The scripts we use on Jenkins had been improperly using `pip install -U ducktape`. This meant that when I pushed out ducktape 0.6.0 it started using that. We actually want to pin to the version specified in the setup.py. I've updated Jenkins to remove the incorrect `pip` command, but now we will need to update this version -- besides a few bug fixes, this newer version added support for the `--compress` flag to compress all the output

I loaded a single partition with 20,000,000 1K records.

My takeaways were the following:\r\n\r\n1. Optimizing `pollNoWakeup` gets most of the benefit without changing prefetching behavior.\r\n2. Increasing max.poll.records even a little gets you close to the maximum throughput possible.\r\n\r\nI guess we should try to figure out why your results are coming out different.
