updateOffset这个方法有两个实现，一个是在本地存储offset，一个是将offset存在broker里。这两种实现分别对应着广播消费和集群消费模式，因此我理解这里的comment有些模糊，但是大意应该没有问题\r\n\r\n@joeCarf Thanks for your reply :)\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in the implementations of method updateOffset() between LocalFileOffsetStore and RemoteBrokerOffsetStore. The codes of updateOffset() in RemoteBrokerOffsetStore (Clustering mode as you said) are as follows：\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/assets/126217979/7943812a-8537-4231-923d-1081dc46dfe5)\r\n\r\nAs per the code, I can not found the interaction between client and broker. Therefore, I still think the comment should be corrected. You are right with the fact that the scheduled service would update offset from client memory to broker disk. However, that action is not directly to update offset to broker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1772543186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1772554676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/7489#issuecomment-1772554676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7489","id":1772554676,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85ppwm0","user":{"login":"joeCarf","id":52153761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTUzNzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52153761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf","html_url":"https://github.com/joeCarf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeCarf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T11:18:33Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T11:18:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"图中的代码只更新了内存中的offset。在`RemoteBrokerOffsetStore`中，有一`persistAll`函数，会将整个offsetTable更新到对应的broker\r\n<img

files.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/assets/21073949/46563582-008c-4f73-94fc-aee6fe19d414)\r\n\r\nHowever, the offsetId can still be found, indicating that the message is not lost and
