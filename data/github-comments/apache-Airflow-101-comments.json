(was trying to cc you on this PR but wasn't sure of your GH handle)\r\n\r\nI am all for more separations of concerns between airflow core and the webserver, and ultimately for fleshing out the API to serve both CLI and UI. However, given the current state of Airflow API, we still have a long way to go.  For example, we probably want some discussions around:\r\n-\tDo we want to leverage the existing Flask framework or migrate to React.js or equivalent?\r\n-\tHow is auth going to look like in the API world?\r\n-\tHow do we maintain backward compatibility and versioning going forward?\r\n\r\nOn top of the discussions, implementing them will still definitely take some time. Putting RBAC on hold until API is done implies a major delay in introducing this feature.\r\n\r\nThat's why I propose that we migrate to FAB first, implement RBAC, and while this going on, we can work on freshing out the API. FAB exposes a list of JSON REST APIs on the models, so that could help with implementing APIs as well if choose to leverage it.\r\n\r\nI understand that one of the major concern is maintaining two sets of wwws for a set period of time. I agree it’s not ideal, and I’m not a fan either, but assuming the community is okay with eventually deprecate the old www (or at least putting development effort on it to a halt), then we can aim to make this dual-www development process fairly minimal by merging it when it’s closer to being ready (not to mention there are still development needed on FAB to reach feature parity, it’ll likely take some time before it’s actually merge-ready).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/324434655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/324435400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2536#issuecomment-324435400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2536","id":324435400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDQzNTQwMA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T19:16:20Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T19:16:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> That's why I propose that we migrate to FAB first, implement RBAC, and while this going on, we can work on fleshing out the API.\r\n\r\n+1 Given that we're pretty close with the FAB migration, I would prefer to get www2 going, and start having people use that. The next step can be REST API work, but I don't want this project to explode. If you recall, all of this began with RBAC security, then we tied the FAB migration to it, now we're discussing REST API. It's too much to do at once. Let's get FAB done, and focus on the REST API subsequently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/324435400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/324437660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2544#issuecomment-324437660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2544","id":324437660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDQzNzY2MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T19:25:40Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T19:25:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2544](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/1e2d237389f974735517f6c6d821ae7563e6b3ec?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.03%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=WdLKlKHOAU)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #2544      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   70.89%   70.85%   -0.04%     \n==========================================\n  Files         150      150              \n  Lines       11585    11585              \n==========================================\n- Hits         8213     8209       -4     \n- Misses       3372     3376       +4\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `77.67% <0%> (-0.37%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2544?src=pr&el=footer).

Things I can see are:\r\n\r\n1. Faster iteration\r\n2. Actually wanting the frontend to be a separate package forever\r\n3. Licensing issues (e.g. if we want to use react)\r\n\r\nI don't see (1) as that compelling, actually. Ultimately, I don't see anyone else contributing until this stuff lands in master and people start using it anyway. Even if they did contribute, the overhead is going to be PR discussion (just like this) anyway. JIRAs are cheap.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to avoid is the demand that we do one big bang commit. I'd rather do things iteratively. If that means we go a bit slower, I'm willing to make that tradeoff, especially if it means we won't end up on some forked version floating out on another repo.\r\n\r\nThe concerns that I have with a separate repo are:\r\n\r\n1. Risk of ending up with some fork that gets left behind as master evolves so quickly\r\n2. If we decide we want to use FAB's data model stuff for some of the REST API, having it in a separate repo is a non-starter if core wants to call it\r\n3. It could be a weird user experience, as it will make it much harder to have a single CLI (`airflow`). We'd have to have some `airflow-webserver` command or something.\r\n\r\nUltimately, my biggest fear is (1), though. I don't want to spend a bunch of time on this and have it floating out in a non-master, non-released repository. I have seen this happen with other large efforts (e.g. Kafka transaction support). Unless you do things incrementally, and in master, you run a risk of ending up with abandonware.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/324466826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/324467198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2495#issuecomment-324467198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2495","id":324467198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDQ2NzE5OA==","user":{"login":"matt-martin","id":956900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NjkwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/956900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin","html_url":"https://github.com/matt-martin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matt-martin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-23T21:25:56Z","updated_at":"2017-08-23T21:25:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We have several use cases where data is overwritten daily in HDFS and this is a helpful way to detect when that happens.

That'd be great if you had the time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/326102897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/326115888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2156#issuecomment-326115888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2156","id":326115888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjExNTg4OA==","user":{"login":"camspilly","id":6192661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTI2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6192661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly","html_url":"https://github.com/camspilly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camspilly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-30T20:52:23Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T20:52:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Are there any plans to revive this?
