Here is my comment for this feature.\n\nI'd like to propose separating JSON cli client from TajoCli. Later, we are improving TajoCli to be specified for SQL and we will add its related features like auto SQL completion. In my opinion, the improvement of TajoCli would be restricted if TajoCli supports both SQL and JSON.\n\nAlso, I think that there are only few of guys want to directly input JSON to command line interface. This feature would be mostly used via Client API.

Excellent! You work is very nice. It works well. I leave only some trivial comments. \n\nAlthough we do not use maven checkstyle plugin to strictly check coding convention, we already use some coding style. Please take a look at this [1]. We use 2 space instead of tab. Other conventions you use look nice to me. \n\nIn addition, it would be better if you use `assertTrue(message : string, condition:boolean)` and `assertEquals(message : string, obj1:Object, obj2:Object)` instead of using `System.out.println` in `isClonedSchema`. It usually generates more comprehensive output messages in the tail of maven message when the test is failed.\n- [1] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAJO/Code+Style\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/44229679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/44233163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/21#issuecomment-44233163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/21","id":44233163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjMzMTYz","user":{"login":"prafullat","id":63756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat","html_url":"https://github.com/prafullat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prafullat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-27T03:39:52Z","updated_at":"2014-05-27T03:39:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for comments.\nI have implemented review comments in latest commit in this pull request.\nShould I also update it on Jira?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/44233163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/44233976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/21#issuecomment-44233976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/21","id":44233976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjMzOTc2","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-27T04:02:30Z","updated_at":"2014-05-27T04:02:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that updating github pull request is enough for us.

It has to be worth to put the name on contributor list. In addition, Min already is a committer. Jinhang seems to continue contribution.So, I agree with him. But, other guys worked long time ago. We can add them if they start contribution again or their code is committed. \n\nIf we need more discussion or need some rule for it, we should create another jira issue.

The last revision adds lots of verification codes and allows OVER clause to support aggregation expressions. In other words, users can directly use aggregation functions within OVER clause.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nselect l_orderkey, count(*) as cnt, row_number() over (order by count(*) desc) row_num from lineitem group by l_orderkey order by l_orderkey\n```\n\nor \n\n```\nselect l_orderkey, row_number() over (partition by l_orderkey order by count(*) desc) row_num from lineitem group by l_orderkey;\n```\n\nI've added a number of unit tests for various cases which can be used in OVER clause. I verified 'mvn clean install'.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/45691619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/45691695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/13#issuecomment-45691695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/13","id":45691695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjkxNjk1","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-11T01:16:17Z","updated_at":"2014-06-11T01:16:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In addition, I refactored `LogicalPlanner::verifyProjectedFields` to be much simplified, and removed unnecessary codes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/45691695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/45691818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/13#issuecomment-45691818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/13","id":45691818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjkxODE4","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-11T01:18:39Z","updated_at":"2014-06-11T01:18:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"After this code is committed to window_function branch, I'll merge `window_function` to the master if there is no objection.

that precedings(followings) are also allowed as end(start) bound in PostgreSQL. \n(Here is the link to bound restrictions in PostgreSQL.

I'll create another jira issue because they also requires a bunch of codes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/46637599/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/46645577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/13#issuecomment-46645577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/13","id":46645577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjQ1NTc3","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-20T05:19:01Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T05:19:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hyunsik thanks!\nI have a great expectation for your next work for remaining window function issues.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/46645577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/46645743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/40#issuecomment-46645743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/40","id":46645743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjQ1NzQz","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-20T05:23:36Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T05:23:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1\n\nThe patch looks good to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/46645743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/46674091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/37#issuecomment-46674091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/37","id":46674091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Njc0MDkx","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-20T12:45:46Z","updated_at":"2014-06-20T12:45:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Hyoungjun,\nthanks for your contribution.\nI left some comments.

Travis causes failure if the log size > 4MB.\n\nI verified 'mvn clean install'. The patch fixes outer join condition bugs and includes enough unit tests to verify the bug fix.\n\nIn addition, I revised some trivial things as follows:\n- Remove unnecessary plan log in GlobalEngine.java\n- Remove commented out lines in TajoTestingCluster and ProjectionPushDownRule\n- Rename EvalTreeUtil::findOuterJoinConditionEvals to EvalTreeUtil::findOuterJoinSensitiveEvals because they are subexpressions of join condition.\n\nI'll commit it shortly.

The patch looks good to me. This patch seems to fix outer join behaviors in terms of following cases:\n- join conditions in located on either ON clause or WHERE clause\n- column references included in join conditions correspond to either row-preserving or null supplying tables.\n\nThere are tree comments:\n- The patch needs rebase. It causes some conflicts against the changes of TAJO-850.\n- TestJoinQuery is changed to use parameterized unit tests. The constructor of TestJoinQuery changes the global configuration in all workers. It affects other unit tests. So, I'm facing following errors. When I remove the reconfiguration in TestJoinQuery, all tests were passed.\n\n```\nResults :\n\nFailed tests:   testGroupbyWithJson(org.apache.tajo.engine.query.TestGroupByQuery): Result Verification expected:<...-------------------(..)\n  testHavingWithAggFunction(org.apache.tajo.engine.query.TestGroupByQuery): Result Verification expected:<...-------------------(..)\n  testGroupByWithSameConstantKeys1(org.apache.tajo.engine.query.TestGroupByQuery): Result Verification expected:<...---------(..)\n  testHavingWithNamedTarget(org.apache.tajo.engine.query.TestGroupByQuery): Result Verification expected:<...-------------------(..)\n  testFilterPushDownPartitionColumnCaseWhen(org.apache.tajo.engine.query.TestJoinOnPartitionedTables): Result Verification expected:<[c_custkey,c_nationkey,c_name,o_custkey,?casewhen(..)\n```\n- I found some trivial NPE bug in outer join tests as follows.
