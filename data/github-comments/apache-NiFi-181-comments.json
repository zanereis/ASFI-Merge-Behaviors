I have tried to replace `HashSet` with `LinkedHashSet` in this class but it doesn't solve the issue. Since during the sync process, the `missingComponents` has been through several transferring. If we want to solve the issue by replacing `HashSet` with `LinkedHashSet`, we may need to do that in several classes/methods.

to Elasticsearch for the `_update_by_query` endpoint, i.e. if you want to run a Script, write your JSON like `{\"script\": {\"source\": \"...\"}, \"query\":

The validator requires a minimum value of 1 sec. This is because the exact rate becomes less accurate the smaller the time period, especially once in sub-second range (and made worse on a busy system.) In order to change the unit tests to a smaller value, the validator would have to change. I do not think that is an advisable approach - to allow configurations which could mislead users in terms of accuracy for the sake of shortening unit tests.

Please squash all of your commits and force-push one single commit, which can be our new baseline.

Of course this would have been more logical if the Scheme property had been there since the beginning, but adding it later does make it a little more challenging.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, the default `BASIC` value shows the `Username` and `Password`, but since they are optional, the effective behavior is `NONE`.\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity of the validation code, I'm not as inclined to add it for informational purposes. Adding `NONE` might be helpful, as it would effectively hide the `Username` and `Password` properties, without the need for custom validation. `PKI` is tricky because the `SSL Context Service` may or may not be used for authentication.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, the `Authorization Scheme` property description does indicate that it is used for authenticating with the `HTTP Authorization header`, which is not applicable to `PKI`. I could go either way on `NONE`. Perhaps just updating the description of the property would be helpful?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1315875952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1315898396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6638#issuecomment-1315898396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6638","id":1315898396,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5ObwQc","user":{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T21:41:22Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T21:41:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will address changes and push asap, thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1315898396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1315911380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6662#issuecomment-1315911380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6662","id":1315911380,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5ObzbU","user":{"login":"ChrisSamo632","id":12159006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU5MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12159006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSamo632","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSamo632/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T21:56:24Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T21:56:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I see the argument either way\r\n\r\nI think there are a couple of changes/fixes here with keeping even if the approach is changed (although they could be rolled into other PRs), e.g. fixes for the integration-tests (broken by the previous addition for API_KEY) and a start of unit tests for the controller class\r\n\r\nThere will possibly be other Auth Schemes to add in future, which could swing the argument - Kerberos and JWT are both supported by Elasticsearch and could be configured for use by NiFi (on my list to raise tickets for these).
