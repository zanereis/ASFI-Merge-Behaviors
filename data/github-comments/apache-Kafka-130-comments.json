The original motivation was that we will let for example `XXXStoreSupplier.build()` to return `XXXStore` instead of not only `StateStore`, and hence in the DSL we will enforce `Window/SessionStoreSupplier` in aggregation / joins instead of just `StateStoreSupplier`, which actually allow users to pass a key-value store supplier that will only cause a RTE. But while implementing it I feel there maybe better ways to achieve this. So feel free to change.\r\n\r\nAbout `stateStoreProcessorNodeMap`, my observation is that it is neither correct nor necessary: it links a store to the FIRST processor node that links to it, while multiple processors could link to this store, and it is used to set the `currentProcessorNode` in `context` when we call `store.flush`, but since we have already stored that information in dirtyEntry and always set/reset it in the flushing listener I feel it is not needed any more. Maybe I miss anything?\r\n\r\nAbout `TupleForwarder`: my rationale is that, we can add some functions like `wrap` like I showed in the example to allow users to wrap their underlying storage engines with library-provided metering / logging / caching functionalities, AND if they don't do it, they either 1) do not really want caching or logging, which is fine; 2) they use their only logging / caching mechanism, in which case they should implement the `loggingEnabled` / etc functions to be false. Then in `KStream/KTableXXXAggregateProcessor.process()` implementation, we can decide if `windowStore isInstanceOf CachingWindowStore` to decide whether or not call `context.foward()` or not knowing that the caching store will execute this step itself; in this case we just won't do any coupling of dedupping with caching if user's customized store does that internally. And in the future, if we completely change KIP-63 to not coupling dedupping with caching but let user specifies triggers, then we can get rid of the `windowStore isInstanceOf` hacky logic as well.\r\n\r\n@dguy BTW I think my refactoring is mingled with too many independent features and each of the above refactoring can be done in a single PR so we can make the reviewing process easier.

If you really know there isn't any external process, you could rely on the newer max.block.ms setting to be very small so it wouldn't retry for very long.

@mjsax About the `old value computation` issue, I cannot think of a quick solution on top of my head and you may not like my \"long\" solution, but here it goes:\r\n\r\n1. Materialize the KTable-KTable Join results as well as the joining KTales. As we discussed in another thread of KTable API confusions this is the last place where we may not materialize a KTable.\r\n\r\n2. After all KTables are materialized, we then do not need to pass the \"<old value, new value>\" pair before the join operations at all, but only before the aggregation operations, since we can always read the old joined value from the materialized store.\r\n\r\n3. For Global KTables, if we add its self joins with global KTables as well in the future, it will no be `virtual` either but also materialized.\r\n\r\n4. One potential issue is, say if we have a multi-way table joins, then it may not be really worthwhile to materialize the intermediate tables as well. This can possibly be resolved when we extend the DSL parsing to global context to optimize some of the topologies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271393703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/271393801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2336#issuecomment-271393801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2336","id":271393801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTM5MzgwMQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-09T20:10:26Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T20:10:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
