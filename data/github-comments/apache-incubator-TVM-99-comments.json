elevating this discussion to its own RFC thread is the right thing to do. What we already know about IEEE anything is that the arithmetic does not support associative and distributive rules of algebra, which results in irreproducible computations in concurrent systems. Since ANY DL system will have to leverage concurrency to be practical, using IEEE will create the same problems as has been plaguing the HPC, geometry, real-time control, optimization, etc. applications.\r\n\r\nWhat is unclear, and what merits research in creating a better understanding is, what the requirements will be for reproducible computation in DL, and better yet, what will be the requirements for explainable DL models. If you can't compute reproducible, it is likely that you won't be able to provide an explainable model either. But a proof would be nice.

Granted, I could pass the Relay module as a variable directly to `exec()` and get the constructors from the module that way*. However, it seems better in the long run for us to take this opportunity to decide on a better representation for `ConstructorValue` that does not rely on having objects from the module in the value representation.\r\n\r\nA simple approach would be a string tag (e.g., '{name of ADT}\\_{name of constructor}\\_{index in ADT definition}'), but there are other choices. I think simplifying the representation would be better for future interoperability (like with @MarisaKirisame's ahead-of-time compiler).\r\n\r\n*Now that I've thought of it, I'll hack in this variant

It is then that one goes and looks at the tutorials for checking that things work just fine - further figuring out the exact version of tensorflow that works with the current trunk of tvm took a bit of time as one cannot expect tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha to work out of the box. Thus follows the question of whether we should also be documenting the versions of the various frameworks that work with TVM for a given version of TVM . \r\n\r\nI also think that it is worth also creating an issues page which details what is expected in a bug report and how a user should report a bug  / what's the minimal set of things we require to see in a bug report so that someone else can reproduce it in order to drive a higher quality of bug reports over time for the community.\r\n\r\nA link to the ci system from the main website seems due.

Besides the highest level, we only need another one that is a common denominator of the two. \r\n\r\nWe also can hide implementations. Specifically, the implementation of hexagon::Device's subclass does not have to appear in the header.\r\n\r\nHere is one possible proposal of organization:\r\n\r\n- src/runtime/hexagon/sim/sim_device.cc\r\n- src/runtime/hexagon/frpc/frpc_device.cc\r\n- src/runtime/hexagon/device/device_lib.cc (device side library for driving the code.)\r\n\r\nDepending on the compilation flag, we only link sim or frpc. Both of them will implement hexagon::Device::Create which creates the hexagon::Device, or the corresponding appropriate subclass.\r\n\r\nThe above comment is based on my first quick pass over the code, so it might be inaccurate, would love to continue discussion as well.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, as in uTVM, we want to leave doors open to implement lazy execution. This will likely mean push the tasks as a linked list argument into the argument section, then ask the device side to execute everything in the list. This does not have to be implemented in this PR, but would be a good thing to keep in mind to make sure the design is future compatible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/491147845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/491149590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3165#issuecomment-491149590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3165","id":491149590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTE0OTU5MA==","user":{"login":"lixiaoquan","id":25603835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjAzODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25603835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaoquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T04:16:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T04:16:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen This fix is about a test itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/491149590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/491149652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3163#issuecomment-491149652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3163","id":491149652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTE0OTY1Mg==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T04:17:18Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T04:28:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One common comment:\r\nCurrently, we only support CDSP.

Additionally, what we need is Alloc/Free (for memory) and Load/Unload (for shared objects).  With that we could switch to LowLevelDeviceAPI (except that I haven't found in the sources).\r\n\r\n> Here is one possible proposal of organization:\r\n> \r\n> * src/runtime/hexagon/sim/sim_device.cc\r\n> * src/runtime/hexagon/frpc/frpc_device.cc\r\n> * src/runtime/hexagon/device/device_lib.cc (device side library for driving the code.)\r\n> \r\n> Depending on the compilation flag, we only link sim or frpc. Both of them will implement hexagon::Device::Create which creates the hexagon::Device, or the corresponding appropriate subclass.\r\n\r\nThis approach requires that both sides (sim and frpc) define the same \"factory\" function.  This means that they can never be built together.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but we need to think about long term consequences of this choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/491404051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/491412364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3171#issuecomment-491412364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3171","id":491412364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTQxMjM2NA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-10T19:58:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-10T19:58:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting this.
