I tried to test it out, though, and it didn't behave as I was hoping. \r\n\r\nI downloaded the GeoLite2 database for ASN and for City. I set the service to lookup all fields. I then copied the City database to \"db.mmdb\" and configured the lookup to load db.mmdb file.

I think we should wrap the entire lookup method in a try/catch and catch InvalidDatabaseException. If this is caught, we should reload the database and try again. If it fails a second time, then we should just throw a LookupFailedException.

@apiri Few things. It seems like we should be using lsb_release to grab the OS as well as chkconfig to handle creating run level symlinks instead of on on our own, at least for most of the OSes.

nifi.\r\n\r\nSo I guess what I'm saying is that I think there might be 3 issues here: OS detection improvement, change how we set run levels, and add systemd unit and upstart scripts for OSes that aren't really doing sysv init anymore.\r\n\r\nFWIW I've been using something like this for the systemd unit:\r\n```\r\n[Unit]\r\nDescription=Apache

Currently that would be 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n- It would probably be a good idea to have the notion of 'nifi-leaderelection-api' which is not about zookeeper but rather just generic election/tracking of a leader for a given thing (a partition?) Then there would be zookeeper based implementations of those.  Processors then can leverage the api for their code but users can select whichever types of services exist (zookeeper being the obvious initial example).  The structure appears already in place for this other than the current naming and perhaps the API referencing zookeeper.

Thanks for contributing.  If i'm reading this right it looks like what this will do is grab the first matching section of a multi-part request.  The current behavior before the patch would be to, i believe, grab all of the request as the flow file content.  Given that, it seems like rather than altering this processor to grab just the first match we'd either want to alter it to grab each section as new flow files OR perhaps better yet have a different processor which understands how to extract out the specific parts into individual flowfiles.  ExtractMultiPartHttp for example could take as input the entire request body in a flowfile that came from ListenHTTP and this new processor could create child objects which are each of the parts.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/303611988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/303613696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1744#issuecomment-303613696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1744","id":303613696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzYxMzY5Ng==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-24T04:21:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T04:21:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kira1508 thanks for contributing.

The timing of this is excellent.  That said the ConvertXtoY processors had a lot of challenges so with NiFi 1.2.0 we now have record reader and writers which various processors can leverage.

We already built in integration for the hwx schema registry service, a built-in simple avro registry, and we can certainly add the confluent schema registry as it appears to be the intent here.

The processors are not starting up as they should when the nodes startup because the writer service is disabled which is presumably because the service it depends on is not available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/303903197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/303903407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1854#issuecomment-303903407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1854","id":303903407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzkwMzQwNw==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-25T02:14:22Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T02:14:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 will merge to master.  thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/303903407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/303907040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1794#issuecomment-303907040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1794","id":303907040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzkwNzA0MA==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-25T02:42:24Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T02:42:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@apiri \r\n\r\nSuSE may or may not be using systemd.

You might think that this is already the point of Generate Table Fetch, but I found that even with an indexed timestamp column you still have to page the index when paging through data on some systems. In one case we found that on SAP Hana we ran into some internal limitations which did not allow you to page past more than 2 billion rows of data.
