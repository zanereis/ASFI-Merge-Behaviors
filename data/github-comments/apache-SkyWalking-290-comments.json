for your contribution, I have two questions:\r\n1. I don't think deleting the condition is a good idea, because we have other queries that need to use the end time bucket filter(such as cache timer). If you don't need the end time bucket filter, just set it as `null`.\r\n2. If you ignore the end time bucket when creating a task, then the profiling will generally be created successfully(if the start time not be set), It's not right.
