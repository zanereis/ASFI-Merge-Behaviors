Guess: cannot upload files larger than the HDFS data block size (64MB), check the log error message: no suitable decomposer.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34233672/171570072-3bb4a43f-0ab3-4474-bb07-bf63fe8bcf40.png)\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nIn the previous version (2.0.5), this function can be used normally, but the upgraded version 3.0.0-alpha and 3.0.0-beta-1 cannot be used normally.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nAfter the cluster is deployed, configure HDFS, use the Hadoop cluster NameNode configured with HA, and upload a file over 128MB (more than HDFS data blocks) after completion\n\n### Anything else\n\nThe problem occurs every time, and the relevant logs are in the latest files under api-server/logs under the installation directory.\n\n### Version\n\n3.0.0-beta-1\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a
