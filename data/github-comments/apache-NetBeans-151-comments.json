Works fine regarding \"selection avoidance\", but have the feeling that autoscrolling works not as good as before.\r\n\r\nHave running two NB instances side-by-side (NB 16 from DMG and compiled master branch; on macOS).\r\nAutoscrolling works pretty reliable in NB 16, but in the version with this PR, it often does not autoscroll.\r\nSeems to depend on how fast I move the mouse out of the table...\r\n\r\nHave tried a different solution:\r\n\r\n- removed `mouseDragged` listener that invokes `scrollRectToVisible()`\r\n- added following code from [JTable.changeSelection()](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/7dfe75cf553193faf709cff6b8b2505680d7cebc/src/java.desktop/share/classes/javax/swing/JTable.java#L2516-L2521) into \"veto return\" block in `ETable.changeSelection()`\r\n\r\nI think this works a little bit better, but not as reliable as before. Don't know why 😕 \r\n\r\nAnyway, for compatibility, I would move autoscrolling to `ETable.changeSelection()` as done in `super.changeSelection()`.\r\nThis also avoids an additional listener and a possible side-effect of always scrolling while dragging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1429739891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1429740367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5491#issuecomment-1429740367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5491","id":1429740367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5VOBtP","user":{"login":"tbw777","id":15821889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIxODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15821889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777","html_url":"https://github.com/tbw777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbw777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T13:21:02Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T13:36:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thereis a more difficult search patterns was found, for example\r\n\r\n- miltilines:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList<String> test = condition ?

Its just that if you would have waited with the merge 1-2 days after review, I am certain someone would have noticed.\r\n\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\nbecause I for example try to look at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/actions on a daily basis to check if there is something to play whack-a-mole with, that is also how I noticed this in the first place. When someone syncs a new or old PR I would notice this too (since it appears on the all-knowing list) and probably check if its properly labeled. IMO the main lesson learned here should be to not rush PRs in, even if they seem trivial and were carefully reviewed.\r\n\r\nThis could have happened with a small PR too which only covers one module or less - it likely would have required some of the [[ci] labels](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/labels?q=%5Bci%5D) too.
