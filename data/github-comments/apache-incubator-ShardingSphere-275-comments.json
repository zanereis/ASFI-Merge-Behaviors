description.\r\n\r\n@linghengqian Could you help to simplify the feature request description? e.g.\r\n- Remove the old issue related workaround, it has been fixed on master branch\r\n- Separate how to implement and related test code and screenshot from feature request to new comment\r\n- Keep core feature description you want and add some wanted timestamp format examples\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1013615731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1013619478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/14793#issuecomment-1013619478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14793","id":1013619478,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M48apsW","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-15T05:55:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-16T09:00:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
