Thanks for review. Actually, I do not have a clear direction for this work now. Let me clarify it and look forward to hearing your advice.\r\nAt the beginning, I found that `NullPolicy.ANY` is not appropriate for all TableFunctions. \r\nFor example, the query in TableFunctionTest#testMultipleScannableTableFunctionWithNamedParameters`.\r\n```\r\nselect * from table(\"s\".\"Maze\"(HEIGHT => 3, WIDTH => 5)`\r\n```\r\nIt passes `null` argument (i.e., `org.apache.calcite.util.Smalls.MazeTable.generate2(5, 3, null)`), but the result is not `null`.\r\n\r\nThen, I think `NullPolicy.NONE` may be more suitable. But it prevents users to define their own NullPolicy in their implementations.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I inclined to adopt the approach (`getNullPolicy(Method m)`) as that in `ScalarFunctionImp`.\r\nBut I found that we do not have any standards to handle the case when a table function returns `null`, as the NPE in tests. Therefore, `NullPolicy.ANY/STRICT/ARG0` seems to be meaningless.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/576201786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/576206023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1593#issuecomment-576206023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1593","id":576206023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjIwNjAyMw==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T10:20:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T10:21:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, so your main question is \"what should Calcite do when a table function returns NPE\"?\r\n\r\nOracle makes it indistinguishable from an empty collection.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect * from dual, table(cast(null as sys.odcinumberlist)) t;\r\n\r\nDUMMY | COLUMN_VALUE\r\n0 rows\r\n\r\nselect * from dual, table(sys.odcinumberlist()) t;\r\n\r\nDUMMY | COLUMN_VALUE\r\n0

function on invalid inputs.\r\nFor instance, if NullPolicy is set to `ANY`, then enumerable executor won't invoke the function in case there are null arguments.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, treating `null` table function result as an empty table is a different

Vladimir, did you check what happens if a table function returns null and it is an argument to a consuming table function?\r\n\r\n`null` argument is just a null argument. Arguments are never converted to empty relations.\r\n\r\nNote: Oracle schema does not make the distinction between `regular functions` and `table functions`. A function can be used as a table function if it returns a collection.\r\nHowever, the very same function can be used in `SELECT` or in `PL/SQL`, and `null` values are allowed for collections.\r\n\r\nSo I think it should be fine to return null from Calcite's table function, however, the executor should treat `table(null)` as an empty relation of the appropriate type.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/576531353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/576537203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1766#issuecomment-576537203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1766","id":576537203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjUzNzIwMw==","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T06:27:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T06:27:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gr4ve , this is relevant: https://www.programcreek.com/2011/09/what-is-the-difference-between-a-java-library-and-a-framework/\r\n\r\nI like how Calcite is more like a library, and Calcite should avoid creating its own rules for the execution environment (e.g. static variables, threading model, and so on).\r\n\r\nYou suggest to create a `ThreadLocal`, however, it would break if multiple classloaders would be required at the same time.

We'd better not bring much burden to users, even a `default` implementation. It is uncertain whether a `Schema`'s concrete implementation (e.g., `JdbcSchema`) can push down case insensitive lookups to underlying datasources. If not, we still need to obtain all tables.\r\nInsteadly, it is more reasonable that Calcite implements case insensitive lookup in `CalciteSchema`. From my understanding (correct me if I am wrong), the initial design might be:\r\n```\r\nSchema: interface for users (case sensitive)\r\n   |\r\nCalciteSchema: wrapper around user-defined schema used internally, providing case (in)sensitive lookups\r\n   |\r\nCachingCalciteSchema/SimpleCalciteSchema\r\n```\r\n(2) \r\n> Most of the implementations should be able to delegate case insensitive requests to NameMap, which would be OK for performance.\r\n\r\nI think `CachingCalciteSchema` has already achieved this goal. It caches tables and maintains them in `NameMap`.\r\nThe javadoc of `CachingCalciteSchema` is:\r\n\r\n>  * Concrete implementation of {@link CalciteSchema} that caches tables,\r\n>  * functions and sub-schemas.\r\n\r\nWhile the javadoc of `SimpleCalciteSchema` is\r\n>  * A concrete implementation of {@link org.apache.calcite.jdbc.CalciteSchema}\r\n>  * that maintains minimal state.\r\n\r\n`SimpleCalciteSchema` and `CachingCalciteSchema` play different roles. If we unify them for the seek of performance, we can just remove `SimpleCalciteSchema`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/584975246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/585018445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1776#issuecomment-585018445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1776","id":585018445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTAxODQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T04:09:10Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T04:09:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Thanks for the PR, can you explain why we need a Presto dialect ?
