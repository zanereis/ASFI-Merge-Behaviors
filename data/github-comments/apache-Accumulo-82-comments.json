It makes it harder to follow. I edited your comment to make it easier to read. You can typically just show the last few lines that show the error, if you run into a problem.\r\n\r\nBased on the message, it looks like you don't have `bash` installed. This would be true if you were building on Windows (which we don't support), but could be true in other environments as well.

My guess is that there are a fair amount of occurrences and some of them need to be addressed. In the case where we are not checking the Future result, we could easily just call another method on the ExecutorService.  The ScheduledExecutorService is a little different because all of the schedule methods return ScheduledFuture objects. We would need to backport the errorprone profile to the 1.10 branch and run it there to know for sure.

The `@Timeout` annotations need to be set per class and will not apply to child classes.

Specifically, if the future is never checked, then we won't know that an Exception or an Error occurred, and that the task is not running. It may be the case that the probability is low of an Exception or Error occurring, but if it did then we would never know. I'm wondering if instead of scheduling the task to run at periodic intervals we modify the Runnable into a loop with a sleep interval. By submitting the Runnable via `execute` instead of `submit`, a Future is not returned and the `AccumuloUncaughtExceptionHandler` will be invoked. Here are some references from server-base in addition to some that I have already fixed in this PR.

It's possible we could move that log4j config file out of the root, and instead put it in a subdirectory where it won't automatically get picked up. We can set some config in the maven-failsafe-plugin to explicitly set the log4j location property for our tests, so they can find the config, but it won't leak into the jar if it gets used elsewhere. If I remember correctly, this and `shellit.shellit` are the last files to move after your changes in #2499 . This one was causing problems this time, but `shellit.shellit` can also be moved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1054609304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1054609737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2527#issuecomment-1054609737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2527","id":1054609737,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM4-3BFJ","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-28T19:57:09Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T19:57:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">

We have discussed using `sync` previously with ZooKeeper, but I don't think we are actually using it anywhere in Accumulo. Presumably you only need to do the third sync call from above, on `txdir`, before checking the status?\r\n\r\nI tried only doing the last one. It didn't exist yet (or the client wasn't aware of its existence), so it had nothing to sync on. I had to sync the parents so knowledge of the children were updated before I could sync the child nodes. It's possible I only needed to sync the parent, though... if the sync is effectively recursive... I'm not sure exactly how it works, only that some aggressive syncing did solve the test failure.\r\n\r\n> This might not be an issue with `Fate` because it all runs in the `Manager` process and the FaTE transaction runner threads are likely using a shared `ZooReaderWriter` from the `ServerContext`. This seems very similar to using the Java `volatile` modifier.\r\n\r\n1. ZooReaderWriter is merely a utility wrapper that adds methods to a ZooKeeper composed within it. It has no state itself, so whether it is shared or not has no influence on the matter. Furthermore, it should use the same ZooKeeper session provided by the ZooSession singleton, so it doesn't matter if you construct a new ZRW or reuse it.\r\n2. Similarly, the ZooKeeper composed within it is itself contained within a ZooSession singleton, and can be replaced if the old ZooKeeper session dies. So, there's no guarantee that you reuse the same ZooKeeper object.\r\n3. And finally, sync is sometimes necessary because you can be talking to a different ZooKeeper server, which ZooKeeper objects can transparently switch between, and not necessarily because of a different ZooKeeper client instance being used. I would imagine that it would stay sync'd for actions performed by the same ZooKeeper client instance, even if it transparently switches to another server, but I don't know what guarantees there are for that.\r\n\r\nIn any case, even if sync isn't necessary for item 3 in this list (assuming the same ZK object stays sync'd when it switches servers transparently), which I'm not sure about, we don't have guarantees over item 2... because ZooSession can change the ZooKeeper object used.\r\n\r\nThese are part of the things I'm trying to investigate in #2298 when I encountered this. However, progress is slow on that because of the complications involving the deprecated Instance/Connector objects and their requirements to use the singleton ZooKeeper sessions, and we can't remove those until 3.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1057420566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1057639346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2543#issuecomment-1057639346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2543","id":1057639346,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM4_Ckuy","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-03T03:53:52Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T03:53:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is an intermediate step on the way to cleaning up #2298 .

And in those cases I think that requiring \"exact\" state across the cluster might point to a more fragile design rather than accepting that it is a distributed system and \"things happen when they happen, deal with it (tm)\" approach.\r\n\r\nI share that concern, and is why I haven't applied this fix yet. However, I'm inclined to advocate for having a sync (asking questions from ZK devs about its usage first) for the test if it looks like this is specifically a test problem. If there are other places in our code that also would benefit from a sync, then those might be pre-existing issues, which can be solved later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1058117116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1058117645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2474#issuecomment-1058117645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2474","id":1058117645,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM4_EZgN","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-03T14:49:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T14:49:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I could be mis-remembering - but fateTransactionStatus is for metrics.
