I had a look at making a similar change to the 4.6 branch however it looks like a lot of refactoring has taken place between the 4.5 branch and master. Please see https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/30e72e4a156a224f109f67b277e1e439bdcc9158 for example. \n\nWe're currently running with 4.5.2 (live and test) internally and this change appears to have fixed the issues we were seeing. Perhaps if there is ever a 4.5.3 release, this could be included with it. \n\nIt's possible we could upgrade our internal test environment to master to see how the migrations are working now with the refactored code, but I won't get chance to do this for another few weeks unfortunately.

At present, I don't have any way to run SolidFire integration tests inside of the Apache community. Perhaps I can leverage a virtual appliance at some point to make this happen, though.\n\n@pdube It turns out it's actually the way the storage framework is implemented. When it invokes the \"delete\" method on the storage plug-in, the \"removed\" column has not yet been updated in the database. That only happens once the plug-in returns \"success\" on its side (then a callback method is invoked within the storage framework to update the \"removed\" column (among other things)). My assumption in the plug-in was initially that this \"removed\" column was updated before the storage framework told me to remove the object, but that was not correct (so I need to treat the volume like it's still \"alive and well\" and just ignore it when I calculate space numbers).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150663033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/150663941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/970#issuecomment-150663941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/970","id":150663941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDY2Mzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-23T19:00:02Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T19:00:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@borisroman
