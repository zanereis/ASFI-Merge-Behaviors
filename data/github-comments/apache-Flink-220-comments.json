It reads like a name where the dot '.' is a word separator. The scheme in which all other config keys are defined is hierarchical, like a path in a nested config group/object structure. Think that the configuration is one huge JSON object, and the key is the dot path to the entry.

But this is the way how punctuated watermark works. If we do not optimize for punctuated watermark, then are we suggesting users not to use punctuated watermark for unbounded over window?\r\n\r\nFor the side effect `By registering timers on different timestamps, we have many timers that all will fire when a watermark is received.`, I think we can add a variable such as `lastProcessedWatermark` to record the last processed watermark. We just need to process when `lastProcessedWatermark` is smaller than the current watermark in `onTimer`. Then there will be no much overhead any more.

punctuated watermark assigner can emit `null` instead of a watermark. So using a punctuated watermark assigner does not mean that for each event a watermark must be emitted. The motivation for punctuated watermarks is to react to specific events that carry watermark information and not to all events (see [JavaDocs](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/AssignerWithPunctuatedWatermarks.java)). Of course there's nothing that prevents users from emitting one watermark per event but as I said this was not the intended use case.\r\n\r\nA `lastProcessedWatermark` state variable would improve the situation a bit by acting as an early out for the `onTimer()` method. However, the system would still need to checkpoint and handle significantly more timers than with the current implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/347359516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/347367852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4681#issuecomment-347367852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4681","id":347367852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzM2Nzg1Mg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T23:50:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T23:50:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @beyond1920, I would like to apply your refactoring for the next release 1.5.0.

`PartitionRequestQueue`.\r\n\r\nAs you said, the latter mainly replaces the `PartitionRequestClientHandler` with the contents of `CreditBasedClientHandler`, also it replaces the

assume you had also tried periodic watermarks in your setting. I'm curious why they didn't work for you. \r\n\r\nA periodic watermark assigner extracts the timestamp from each record and just emits a watermark when it is asked. From a correctness point of view, this should be the same as punctuated watermarks, just with lower overhead and higher watermark latency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/347451529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/347459805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5063#issuecomment-347459805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5063","id":347459805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzQ1OTgwNQ==","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T09:13:11Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T09:13:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For historical reasons, we only use punctuated watermark currently.
