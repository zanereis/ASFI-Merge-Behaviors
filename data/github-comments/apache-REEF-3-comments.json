RAT now passes. However, I have a couple of questions regarding the excludes added:\n\n``` xml\n<exclude>lang/cs/.nuget/**</exclude>\n```\n\nFiles in this folder are version controlled and part of the release. Can't we just add licensing headers to them? Or otherwise, enumerate the files we can't have license headers on.\n\n``` xml\n<exclude>**/packages.config</exclude>\n```\n\nThis is included in the above. Also, it could have a licensing header.\n\n``` xml\n<exclude>**/protobuf/**</exclude>\n<exclude>**/avro/**</exclude>\n```\n\nWe should move those to a separate folder for generated sources. Maybe not during this PR, but shortly after it.\n\n``` xml\n<exclude>**/*.conf</exclude>\n<exclude>**/*.csv</exclude>\n<exclude>**/*.bin</exclude>\n```\n\nThese seem overly broad. For one. we usually shouldn't have `.bin` files. And in the other cases, we might have them and would want to add a license.
