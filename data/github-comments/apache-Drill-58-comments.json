thank you for review. I've made some changes, please take a look.\r\n\r\nThere is a (interface) `DictWriter` similar to what you proposed with the exception it `extends` `ArrayWriter`, i.e. when writing a `dict` is assumed to be an array of tuples (with `key` and `value` fields) other than a pair of arrays. (`DictWriter`'s implementation, `ObjectDictWriter`, actually `extends ObjectArrayWriter`).\r\n\r\nFor reading, there is a (interface) `DictReader` (`extends ColumnReader`) introduces 5 new methods:\r\n```\r\nObjectReader getValueReader(Object key);\r\nObject get(Object key);\r\nint size();\r\nValueType keyColumnType();\r\nObjectType valueColumnType();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor key/value lookup `getValueReader(Object key)` is used. When a `key` is found, `value`'s reader is returned with its position set correspondingly to the `key`. In a case there is no such `key` - a special type of `ObjectReader` - `org.apache.drill.exec.vector.accessor.reader.NullReader` will be returned.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that array access is needed - can't see any use case yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/548392780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/548922108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1888#issuecomment-548922108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1888","id":548922108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODkyMjEwOA==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-01T19:31:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-01T19:41:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the submission!!

Developers often run the Drill unit tests to verify that a change works. We count on the unit tests to be complete. If some bit of functionality is not covered in unit tests, then it is possible to break that functionality in a PR, and to not learn of that error by running unit tests.\r\n\r\nWhen a test exists only in the test framework, we must rely on a MapR employee to run the pre-commit tests for us. If the test fails, we are not set up to run the test to track down the problem.\r\n\r\nThe test framework works best when it acts as an end-to-end test at scale: across many data types, many query types and so on.\r\n\r\nIf this particular test is only for one specific bit of functionality, and uses a small (80MB) file, perhaps it should remain in unit tests?\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to package the test framework in a way that others can run it. Impala did a nice job of providing scripts to set up a \"mini cluster\" to allow running the E2E tests on a developer box (typically an Ubuntu system in AWS.)\r\n\r\nIs there a way to retain the test in the unit tests, perhaps with a smaller file?

I observed above that the current way of handling nested types is getting too complex, with all the special cases and \"resumeFoo\" methods.\r\n\r\nThe current design was originally designed to build a `BatchSchema` with `MaterializedField`s,. Those classes require a top-down construction. (That is also why the final `build()` method returns a `BatchSchema` and why we must call `buildSchema()` to get a `TupleMetadata`.)\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the `SchemaMetadata` classes *do not* have the same constraints. They can actually be built bottom-up. It never occurred to me to clean up the old-style of building when we repurposed `SchemaBuilder` to build metadata objects.\r\n\r\nSo, since we can change the structure, we could borrow a technique from, I think, certain JSON builders. Rather than having the schema builder create the nested type builder, ask the user to do so explicitly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTupleMetadata schema = new SchemaBuilder()\r\n  .addMap(new MapBuilder(\"myMap\")\r\n    .add(\"name\", MinorType.VARCHAR)\r\n    .addMap(new MapBuilder(\"nested\")\r\n      .add(\"id\", MinorType.INT)\r\n      .build())\r\n    .build())\r\n  .add(\"last\", MinorType.INT)\r\n  .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdopting this model has additional benefits. It is currently a bit awkward to create a bare `ColumnMetadata`. We could create helper methods to create each kind of column schema. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo = SchemaBuilder.column(\"foo\", MinorType.INT, DataMode.REQUIRED);\r\nbar = SchemaBuilder.dict(\"bar\", MinorType.VARCHAR)\r\n  .value(SchemaBuilder.map(...))\r\n  .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nLots of things we can play with.\r\n\r\nGiven all of this, my advice for the `DICT` type is to figure out something that works with the structure we already have. Then, as a separate PR, we can clean up the `SchemaBuilder` to make it easier to use for the many complex types we now support. That way, you don't have to solve the schema builder problem in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/552769421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/552863239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1886#issuecomment-552863239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1886","id":552863239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mjg2MzIzOQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T11:56:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T11:56:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, please squash the commits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/552863239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/554203211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1897#issuecomment-554203211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1897","id":554203211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDIwMzIxMQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-15T04:07:30Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T04:07:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvysotskyi, thanks much for the review and for committing the code.

background: this PR includes work completed about two years ago as part of the \"row set\" (EVF) project. We had to first get the EVF itself reviewed and merged, then we added provided schema support. The first attempt to merge the JSON reader uncovered many issues with batch, record and vector counts. Those have been fixed over the last couple of months. This time, the unit tests pass with the new JSON reader.\r\n\r\nThis PR leaves the old \"V1\" reader enabled by default. More testing is required before we enable the \"V2\" reader by default.\r\n\r\nBecause this work pre-dated the \"provided schema\" work, it does not yet support the provided schema. Let's get this version merged, then we can add the additional work needed to support a provided schema.\r\n\r\nAlso, any work done in the \"V1\" JSON reader in the last two years is not yet reflected in the \"V2\" version. We make any such changes after this PR.\r\n\r\nJSON is a surprisingly complex and tricky format. Suggestions for further tests or improvements are welcome.\r\n\r\nThis is decent size change. It should be merged after the 1.17 release is completed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560030850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560137927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1910#issuecomment-560137927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1910","id":560137927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDEzNzkyNw==","user":{"login":"agozhiy","id":31588230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31588230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy","html_url":"https://github.com/agozhiy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T18:04:04Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T18:04:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The meta-question is why we still need this after all these years?
