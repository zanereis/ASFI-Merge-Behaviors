is my suggestion:\r\n\r\nYou are using event flow : **SparderMetricsListener**  -> **QuerySparkMetrics**  -> **QueryService/QueryMetricsFacade** -> MetricsSystem, I think it is OK if you send MetricsEvent direct to MetricsSystem : **SparderMetricsListener** -> **QuerySparkMetrics** -> **MetricsSystem**.\r\n\r\nIn the previous implementation, when a query is finished, all metrics data are collected because query and metrics collection are in the same thread.

Hi, when I try to use Apache Calcite to solve this problem, I realized something\r\n\r\nThe function of this method includes:\r\n(1) Correctly delete comments in sql\r\n(2) The parameter string may contain multiple SQL,and could be DDL、DML...\r\n(3) The result of string should retain the original sql style;E.g, select need be select,can not converted to SELECT\r\n(4) This function does not need to verify whether the SQL conforms to the SQL syntax specification\r\n\r\nI can't find a suitable API in Apache Calcite to meet the above requirements.In my opinion, even using Apache Calcite's API to solve this problem will be very troublesome.\r\nMaybe it’s because I’m not very familiar with Apache Calcite.
