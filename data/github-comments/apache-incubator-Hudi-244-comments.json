with @YannByron and @danny0405 and we agreed that for `supplemental.logging=true` use case: \r\n- users can set `cdc.supplemental.logging=true` to log extra info\r\n- the extra info contains record key, operation type (I/U/D), \"before\" image, \"after\" image\r\n  - a config can be used to skip logging the \"after\" image\r\n- the extra info should be encoded in a new cdc log

last scenario to finalize is, as brought up by @danny0405, flink writes all input records to log files for MOR tables without knowing which are inserts or updates or deletes (bucket index only checks which file group to write to). Only when compacting, then we can tell I/U/Ds. On spark's side, with bloom index, both writer and compactor would know the I/U/D operation type info of the input records.\r\n\r\nFor MOR tables, we can consider only letting compactor / mergehandle write cdc log blocks, after successful compaction. This has following advantages:\r\n- standardization of the cdc logging mechanism across write engines\r\n- logically cdc logging should be part of the transaction of running compaction\r\n- it won't compromise the MOR write throughput\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1156525801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1156597594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5765#issuecomment-1156597594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5765","id":1156597594,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5E8Eda","user":{"login":"melin","id":1145830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDU4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1145830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin","html_url":"https://github.com/melin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-15T15:10:50Z","updated_at":"2022-06-18T11:35:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hbase rely on hadoop-hdfs-client 2.10.

Only when compacting, then we can tell I/U/Ds. On spark's side, with bloom index, both writer and compactor would know the I/U/D operation type info of the input records.\r\n> \r\n> For MOR tables, we can consider only letting compactor / mergehandle write cdc log blocks, after successful compaction. This has following advantages:\r\n> \r\n> * standardization of the cdc logging mechanism across write engines\r\n> * logically cdc logging should be part of the transaction of running compaction\r\n> * it won't compromise the MOR write throughput\r\n\r\nAnd in for both COW and MOR tables, the cdc log block is only an optional optimization IMHO, because we can always deduce the change logs on the fly, the for MOR table, the user may expect the end-to-end latency as well so we can not always wait for the compaction to generate the cdc changes on reader side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1157289026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1157291181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5880#issuecomment-1157291181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5880","id":1157291181,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5E-tyt","user":{"login":"gtwuser","id":6791570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTE1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6791570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser","html_url":"https://github.com/gtwuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtwuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-16T06:39:44Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T06:39:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@nsivabalan @xushiyan @umehrot2 any pointers or recommendations, this should be the last issue on Hudi which we are trying to fix post that we can move to production, so kindly help us out here.
