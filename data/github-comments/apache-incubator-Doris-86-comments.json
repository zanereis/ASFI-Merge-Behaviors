I find that you reused the schema change logic. It's ok to reuse the logic but not reuse the code, we should not modify schema change code since it is very serious. We should rewrite a new job very like schema change. Because some logic has micro differences, for example there are 10 tablet doing migration, if one tablet failed, then schema change is failed, but storage migration should ignore the failure and may add a new task for the failed tablet.\r\n2. I think if user set the partition to COLD, then it should be freezed, not allow to insert new data. It is acceptable. But I think It is very important to allow SCHEMA CHANGE!!! because schema change is table level.\r\n3. If the tablet is a new tablet and it is not writeable, or do compaction, then there should be no rubbish or garbage, so that we do not need to care about gc or sweep logic for remote storage.\r\n4. FE should care about rubbish tablet for example if one tablet do migration failed fe should do gc logic. For example, FE may call BE's API do this gc logic.\r\n5. Remote Storage Medium is set to tablet level, it is ok. But not a separate parameter, it should be part of table meta both in FE and BE.\r\n6. We should write clone logic on FE maybe it is just a create tablet logic on BE, BE just load the header file from remote storage.\r\n7. There are also many other logics like backup, restore, snapshot logic. Maybe we could disable some feature at current step and implement them in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1079815584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1079817714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/7529#issuecomment-1079817714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/7529","id":1079817714,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5AXLXy","user":{"login":"yiguolei","id":9208457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg0NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9208457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei","html_url":"https://github.com/yiguolei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiguolei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-27T02:16:59Z","updated_at":"2022-03-27T02:16:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also think Env is not used properly.

Instead of using mem limit uniformly?\r\n> \r\n> there are 2 reason:\r\n> \r\n> 1. broadcast is not always fast than shuffle. The cost of creating a FULL TABLE hash table is not negligible when broadcast table is large.\r\n> 2. In be, we allocate hash table in buffer pool, and it' is not limited by mem limit.\r\n\r\n1. Added a new memory parameter that will make it more difficult for users to understand and debug.\r\nI understand that broadcast is faster than shuffle in most cases. If shuffle is faster than broadcast, it is not directly related to the size of the hash table, but is related to the gap between the data sizes of the left and right tables.\r\nIn this case, can manually hint to specify the join method.\r\n\r\n2. From what I see, the MemPool currently used by HashJoinNode allocates the memory of the HashTable, and the BufferPool is only used in the HashTable of the Partitioned Agg.\r\n\r\nIf the remaining 1G is to reserve memory for a query except for hash join, we should try to estimate the memory consumption of all nodes in a fragment, and complete it by collecting statistics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1080590449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1080601888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/8680#issuecomment-1080601888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/8680","id":1080601888,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5AaK0g","user":{"login":"caiconghui","id":55968745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTY4NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55968745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui","html_url":"https://github.com/caiconghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caiconghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T12:41:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T12:41:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

So is this issue present in the whole repository or some of the files?\r\n\r\nLet me give a example.\r\n\r\nIn the `be/src/env`, other `.h` file include `.env.h` . `.cpp` file include corresponding `.h` file.\r\n\r\nSo, all file include `env.h`. We can remove all `include` in  `.env.h`  in the other file.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\n#include <memory>\r\n#include <string>\r\n```\r\nis in `env.h`.  Other file can remove them.\r\n\r\nWe can remove other redundant included header like above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1081510407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
