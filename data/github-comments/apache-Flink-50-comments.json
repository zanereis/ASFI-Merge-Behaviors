It is written failsafe, where it does not crash even if `state` does not handle null values properly. This is good, because it helps prevent future bugs. The performance cost is minimal.\n\nConcerning performance:  This is an actor message send and processed asynchronously by the JobManager. These code paths should never saturate the CPU in any reasonable setup, and even the computation during the processing of this message is dominated by other parts (cache misses during hash table lookups). Checking more, this method is never even executed. It is there only for the sake of testing / debugability.\n\nPlease double check whether statements really need fixing.

It contains some runtime info for tasks (attempt number) but not all (subtasks, etc).

In that case, why not create a `RuntimeInfo` for the task (keep the `TaskManagerInfo`), put all the task-specific information in there, pass it to the `RuntimeEnvironment` and `RuntimeContext` and let them return all info like `getTaskName` and `getIndexOfThisSubtask` from there?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131767636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131768999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1026#issuecomment-131768999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1026","id":131768999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTc2ODk5OQ==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T10:25:43Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T10:25:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.

I thought about putting every task specific field into the TaskInfo object but since it isn't a real problem, hesitated. \nShould I do that then? I certainly like the idea. The constructors for `RuntimeContext` are somewhat messy, and doing this would make any future changes to contexts a lot easier.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131768999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/131769530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1031#issuecomment-131769530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1031","id":131769530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTc2OTUzMA==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T10:27:30Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T10:27:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Does this work properly with collect() calls? as in, would the following plan still work?\n\n`env = ..\nenv.registerCacheFile()\n...\nsomeSet.collect()\n<doSomethingThatUsesTheCacheFile>\nenv.execute()\n`\n\nif we wipe all cache entries in the collect() call, the files will not be registered in the execute(), right?

There is, however, a strange \"feature\" that won't work anymore. This code works on master: https://gist.github.com/aljoscha/bbe74309a31a16ca8413. It catches away the exception that results from not being able to determine the output type of the generic map. Then, when `execute` is called it executes just fine up until (and including) the generic map as can be seen from the `println` output.\n\nWith this PR this won't work anymore. Upon `execute` the StreamGraphBuilder tries to build the StreamGraph from the graph of Transformations. It encounters the dangling map for which the output type cannot be determined and fails.\n\nThis behavior is problematic since the TestStreamEnvironment is reused for several streaming tests. Tests fail in seemingly unconnected parts of the code because dangling operators without type information still linger in the execution environment. I mentioned this here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2508\n\nI have a quick fix for this, for now. I think, however, that the streaming tests need to be consolidated and the streaming environments also need to be refactored a bit. (In addition to the batch exec envs, because they should probably be reused in large parts for streaming.)

@Rucongzhang,\n\nAs this is your first contribution to Flink and the PR was issued before a relevant notice on the developer mailing list that advises against merging it [1], I am merging this - but I highlight the fact the Flink community seems to have an agreement that these changes should be mostly rejected in the future.\n\nI strongly agree with @fhueske's comment on the mailing list [2] that you find plenty of already open relevant issues on JIRA, I would suggest to pick up one of those. If an issue you like happens to be a bit unclear the community is happy to give you directions.\n\nHappy coding Flink. :smile: \n\n[1]
