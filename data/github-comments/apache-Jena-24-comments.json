took this branch and made a few minor modifications (to see if it would work with JakartaEE 8). I was able to get it to compile and the initialization steps in LangJSONLD11.Sys worked correctly. This was with Titanium 0.8.6 (the last version to support JakartaEE8) and org.glassfish:jakarta.json version 1.1.6\r\n\r\nThe challenge is that the Titanium API has changed in subtle ways between 0.8.6 and 1.x. For example, in both versions, the `com.apicatalog.jsonld.JsonLd.toRdf(com.apicatalog.jsonld.document.Document)` method returns a `ToRdfApi` object. But in 0.8.6, that class is located in the `com.apicatalog.jsonld.api.impl` package, and in 1.1.0, that class is in the `com.apicatalog.jsonld.api` package.\r\n\r\nSo when using this with a JakartaEE 8 platform, I end up with this error: \r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'com.apicatalog.jsonld.api.ToRdfApi com.apicatalog.jsonld.JsonLd.toRdf(com.apicatalog.jsonld.document.Document)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to only support JakartaEE 9 with this code. That might be a fine first step.\r\n\r\nThe way I was approaching this involved using two separate packages: `jena-jsonld` and `jena-jsonld-jee8` in which the first one used the JakartaEE 9 packages and Titanium version 1.1.0. The second package used the JakartaEE 8 packages and the earlier version of Titanium. Then the ServiceLoader did all the work in terms of bringing in the right version (provided that the user of the library included the correct

Leave it in `QueryIterService` for now?\r\n\r\n_Default_\r\n\r\nI'd like to handle the default case (in the PR, no factory found) as a regular `ServiceExecutorFactory` added from `ARQ.init` rather than code here. It is nice to have a \"really no SERVICE support\" done by clearing the registry even if we keep the old context approach.\r\n\r\nThe code will need to handle \"no factory found\" as `QueryExecException` or a join-identity\r\nquery iterator depending on `SILENT`.\r\n\r\n_Substituted vs original op_\r\n\r\nThis isn't so easy to treat as separate.\r\n\r\n* A dispatch may be `SERVICE ?service` with `?service` already bound but the\r\nregistration is to `<someURI>`.\r\n\r\n* This code is in `nextStage` so iteration is happening further out. If the implementation wants bottom-up only, might have to have a different optimizer - i.e. needs to take a wider view. It can still do a single execution and keep that internally (`QueryIterator.close` will be called for clear-up).\r\n\r\nI don't think that is common so the API can focus on the usual case because the other can still be done as long as the original is available.\r\n\r\nHow about providing both in the factory call so the implementation is informed?\r\n\r\nWith those points:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface ServiceExecutorFactory {\r\n    QueryIterator createExecutor(OpService op, OpService original, Binding binding, ExecutionContext context);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe switch to `ExecutionContext` is a good idea.\r\n\r\n_Timing_\r\n\r\nWe are close to the 4.2.0 release point. As an extension to advertise, we should take the time to get it right. A whole cycle (3-4 months) is a bit long so my suggestion is include in 4.2.0 with the understanding that it is \"Experimental - work-in-progress - subject to refinement\".\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/912978339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/913015382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1064#issuecomment-913015382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1064","id":913015382,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec42a4JW","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-04T18:05:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-04T18:05:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the updates.\r\n\r\nHow about WebACL?

Returning the QueryIterator directly does not guarantee that; some iterators may already be live when they are returned - others only initialize on .next / .hasNext. \r\nAs a custom service clause is essentially a specification of some task, createExecutor should essentially take the role of **validating** the OpService (raise an exception if something is wrong, like illegal arguments). Only if all is fine then return the object from which the execution can be started. I'd say this is an important aspect in the architecture. As mentioned, this could also be a separate method - but then the code typically becomes:\r\n```java\r\nif (factory.validate(args)) {\r\n  factory.run(args); //  Usually calls validate as first thing again\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo with the supplier I wanted to avoid to introduce yet another interface, but I actually had that in mind:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface ServiceExecutorFactory {\r\n    ServiceExecutor createExecutor(OpService op, OpService original, Binding binding, ExecutionContext context);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface ServiceExecutor { // Similar to QueryExecution\r\n    QueryIterator exec(); // Similar to execSelect\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet, it does not exactly match up, because in QueryExecution/ResultSet vs ServiceExecutor/QueryIterator the QueryIterator is the actual execution (it also has the close() method which aborts execution).\r\n\r\nI realize that some time ago we also discussed the use case where SERVICE is invoked for batches of bindings (possibly in parallel) by using a different base class than QueryIterRepeatApply.

RDF.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/951376039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/953992540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1089#issuecomment-953992540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1089","id":953992540,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec443MVc","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-28T16:09:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T16:09:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PR
