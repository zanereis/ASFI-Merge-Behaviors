There is code overlap between this PR and PR #5452. After discussion with Mingyu Chen, we first push forward PR #5452. About storing stream load meta in BE, it's a tradeoff. If BE reports the stream load result to FE  when each stream load job finished, it may result in too much stress for FE RPC. So the stream load results are temporarily stored on BE and then sent to FE by batch. After finished data sending, stream load meta will be removed from BE soon. Do you have any better idea?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/810298145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/810698322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/5488#issuecomment-810698322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/5488","id":810698322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDY5ODMyMg==","user":{"login":"kangkaisen","id":9894906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTQ5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9894906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen","html_url":"https://github.com/kangkaisen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangkaisen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-31T01:58:20Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T01:58:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@weizuo93
