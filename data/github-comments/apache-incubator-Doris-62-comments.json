Seems there are some misunderstands, the example  in #7204 is for KEY not VALUE。  aggregation function for **KEY columns** should be MAX or MIN, if we use SUM, it should report like \"the type of agg on StorageEngine's Key column should only be MAX or MIN\".  hope this explanation make you more clear.

I see. Doris already has `max_connection` limit which can be set for each user. But I think what you need is not just limit the number of connection, but to limit the `rate` of request.\r\n> \r\n> As far as I know, Guava's rate limiter may meet the requirement. But what more important is, how to define the `rate`? Simply put, it may be a limitation of QPS. But the essence is \"control the consumption of cluster resources per unit time.\"\r\n> \r\n> So I think in the first version, we can implement this function through simple rules (such as QPS). But in the specific design, we must reflect the abstract design of \"system resources\" so that we can add more rules later.\r\n> \r\n> Looking forward your PR!\r\n\r\nWhere do you think the limiter should be put, BE or FE? As Guava is for Java, Do you think the limiter is better in FE?

The doris-flink naming method refers to the previous doris-spark naming\r\n2. I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean very much, do you want to only support json format import?\r\n3. Batch delete only supports unique model. When merge_type: DELETE, data with the same key will be deleted automatically. For changelog data, adding this request header should be fine.\r\n4. RestService is a package class for requesting FE, such as reading the execution plan, obtaining the BE list, etc. DorisStreamLoad is the package class used by StreamLoad when writing Doris. I personally think that the distinction between meetings is clearer","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/979966681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/981052992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/7209#issuecomment-981052992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/7209","id":981052992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs46ea5A","user":{"login":"doudianer","id":33255987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU1OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33255987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer","html_url":"https://github.com/doudianer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doudianer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-28T09:32:08Z","updated_at":"2021-11-28T09:32:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you.

The reason is that at the beginning, flink-connector only supports csv, and the json format import was added later. In order to be compatible with historical versions, two formats are reserved.\r\n3. The idea of using merge is great, especially when there are **append** and **deleted** events in a batch of data, you can directly set `__DELETE_SIGN__` to 1, so there is no need to split into multiple batches of data, but StreamLoad does not seem to provide modification at present `__DELETE_SIGN__`

Execution of Table Function Node\r\n\r\nTable Function Node (TFN) contains one or more Table Functions, and its main logic is to expand the data received from the child nodes into multiple rows through the Table Function and return the data to the upper layer. The main execution process is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Get a row of data from the child node child row.\r\n2. Pass the child row into each table function, and each table function will calculate and get a result set: S1, S2,...\r\n3. Do the Cartesian product of child row and each result set and send it to the upper layer.\r\n\r\nfor example. Suppose the child row has 3 columns, k1, v1, v2:\r\n\r\n| k1 | v1 | v2 |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| 1 | \"a,b,c\" | \"4,5,6\" |\r\n\r\nTwo Table Functions: `explod_split(v1,',')` and `explode_split(v2,',')` respectively produce the following result sets:\r\n\r\n| `explod_split(v1,',')` |\r\n|---|\r\n| \"a\" |\r\n| \"b\" |\r\n| \"c\" |\r\n\r\n| `explode_split(v2,',')` |\r\n|---|\r\n| \"4\" |\r\n| \"5\" |\r\n| \"6\" |\r\n\r\nThe final Cartesian product result is:\r\n\r\n| k1 | `explod_split(v1,',')` | `explode_split(v2,',')` |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| 1 | \"a\" | \"4\" |\r\n| 1 | \"a\" | \"5\" |\r\n| 1 | \"a\" | \"6\" |\r\n| 1 | \"b\" | \"4\" |\r\n| 1 | \"b\" | \"5\" |\r\n| 1 | \"b\" | \"6\" |\r\n| 1 | \"c\" | \"4\" |\r\n| 1 | \"c\" | \"5\" |\r\n| 1 | \"c\" | \"6\" |\r\n\r\n### Table Function Interface Design\r\n\r\nBecause Doris does not currently support complex data types (such as Array), and Table Function is essentially an expression that returns an array type. So in this implementation, we will do special treatment for Table Function.\r\n\r\n1. DummyTableFunctions\r\n\r\n    This is a deception class. Its main purpose is to generate the scalar function signature of the table function on the BE side to facilitate query planning on the FE side, and to use the existing scalar function framework when the BE performs parameter expression calculations. In other words, in the planning and execution preparation stages of the entire query, Table Function is treated as a scalar function.\r\n\r\n2. TableFunctionFactory\r\n\r\n    The factory class of Table Function returns real Table Function instances based on the function name. Currently only supports matching Function by function name.\r\n    \r\n3. TableFunction\r\n\r\n    The actual Table Function implementation class. Provide the following interfaces:\r\n    \r\n    1. prepare()/open()\r\n    \r\n        Some preparations, such as calculation of constant expressions, memory allocation for intermediate result sets, and so on.\r\n    \r\n    3. process(row)\r\n\r\n        According to the incoming data (row), calculate the Table Function result set.\r\n    \r\n    4. reset()\r\n\r\n        Because of the Cartesian product relationship between multiple Table Functions, all the result sets of a Function may be traversed multiple times. This method will set the cursor of the result set to the initial position in order to continue the traversal.\r\n    \r\n    5. get_value()\r\n\r\n        Get the value of the position pointed by the current cursor.\r\n    \r\n    6. forward()\r\n\r\n        Move the cursor forward, then you can call get_value() to get the next value\r\n    \r\n    6. close()\r\n\r\n        The cleanup work after Function execution.\r\n        \r\n    The subclasses of TableFunction are concrete implementations of each Table Function. The following three functions are implemented in this issue:\r\n    \r\n    1. `explode_split(str, delimiter)`\r\n\r\n        Split str into multiple strings according to delimiter.\r\n        \r\n    2. `explode_json_array_xxx(json_str)`\r\n\r\n        Split a json array. According to the type of elements in the json array, xxx can be string, int or double\r\n        \r\n    3. `explode_bitmap(bitmap)`\r\n\r\n        Expand a bitmap and return the value of each element in the bitmap.\r\n        \r\n### Table Function Node Interface Design\r\n\r\n Table Function Node inherits from Exec Node. There are the following interfaces:\r\n \r\n 1. init()\r\n\r\n    Some initialization work, including obtaining Table Function objects, etc.\r\n    \r\n2. prepare()/open()\r\n\r\n    Some preparations. For example, prepare()/open() of the call expression\r\n    \r\n3. get_next()\r\n\r\n    Get a batch of results. Here, get_next() of the child node will be called to get the child node data first, then calculate the result of the Table Function, and return the data after the association.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/982366698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/982404951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/7245#issuecomment-982404951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/7245","id":982404951,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs46jk9X","user":{"login":"wangxingsen666","id":73706454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzA2NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73706454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxingsen666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxingsen666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T08:39:40Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T08:39:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> This bug does not include in 0.15.0-rc04, and it has been fixed by #7172\r\n\r\nThis bug still exists in 0.15.0-rc04 !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/982404951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/982412880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/7245#issuecomment-982412880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/7245","id":982412880,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs46jm5Q","user":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T08:48:50Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T08:48:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That is strange.
