I requested an option to hide it (not remove it completely).

IMHO.\r\n\r\nI totally disaggree with the \"empty editor\" I think first the problem is with the wording, It is not an editor IMHO the edior is a tab with content inside. This is the background of an empty editor or the area where editors can be placed. If you have an empty editor, it is just a empty tab.\r\n\r\nSecond I aggree with more options (yes makes it more comples but this is the reality someone wants it, someone doesn't want it). So yes an option to hide this should be good. For me I also use NB since 2013 I guess but for my daily work, unfortunately I need to move to another IDE but this is another point. Why I say this in this context? We have more stuff here to do and to make it more professional or also to make it more stable as before. But it is our work to do this.

This feature displays an empty results panel immediately upon activation and then progressively loads search results as you begin typing. The results appear quickly, even if they aren’t instantly complete, and this popup includes search customization options, such as case insensitivity, without requiring a prior configuration step.\r\n\r\n@Chris2011 By \"instantly,\" I don’t mean that all search results load instantaneously but rather that the popup itself should appear right away with any initial results, even as more results load progressively (this will still be quick, as is the case with \"Go to File\"). Currently, even with the `ctrl+f7` configuration popup, loading takes time, so I don’t see the pre-configuration window step as enhancing speed.\r\n\r\nThe following points address some specific feedback:\r\n1. **Configuration Before Search**: `cmd+click` should skip the configuration popup, similar to how \"Go to File\" works, where options like case insensitivity are secondary and don’t require a pre-search configuration screen. This simplifies the workflow and allows for immediate interaction.\r\n2. `ctrl+shift+click` **as a Reverse Navigation Mechanism**: I fully agree with @mbien’s suggestion to use `cmd+shift+click` (or `ctrl+shift+click` on Windows) as a reverse of `cmd+click`, enabling a “find usages” action directly from the clicked symbol. This approach mirrors the existing \"go to declaration\" action and enhances symmetry in navigation.\r\n3. __Displaying a Long Results List in Context Menu__: I understand @mbien's concern that a long list of usages may be overwhelming in a single popup. However, we already handle potentially large results lists effectively in other contexts. For instance, the \"Go to File\" search shows numerous files in a popup without issue. Furthermore, this list could provide sorting or filtering options to refine search scope or narrow down results.\r\n4. **Setting a Reasonable Default Scope**: By default, the search could cover open projects and dependencies. This default setting also aligns with the behavior in the current `ctrl+f7` \"find usages\" which provides a familiar experience for users and can still allow for further configuration if needed.\r\n5. **Jumping to Specific Usage Items**: In cases where a user wishes to jump directly to one specific usage, there are several options: they could use bookmarks, a filter within the popup, or the traditional `ctrl+f7` \"find usages\" in a dedicated tab. Furthermore, the popup could include an option to display all usages in a new tab, offering the flexibility to switch between quick access and a more detailed view.\r\n6. **Accessibility of the Dedicated Usage Window**: While `ctrl+f7` is technically one shortcut away, it still requires at least one button click and some waiting time for results. A dedicated, progressive-loading popup would offer users more immediate access to results. Furthermore, the convenience of `cmd+click` offers a much more accessible, user-friendly shortcut compared to `ctrl+f7`, especially for actions like \"find usages\" which are frequently used during navigation and code review. While `ctrl+f7` requires both hands and disrupts flow to a degree, `cmd+click` is as simple as a mouse click with a quick key press, making it feel more intuitive. This accessibility is key, particularly in large codebases where quick, context-aware navigation can significantly improve productivity and user experience.\r\n\r\nThis streamlined approach aims to improve efficiency by allowing users to access \"find usages\" results without the interruption of an initial configuration popup, letting them focus on the actual search and refinement steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2449063613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2449161512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7915#issuecomment-2449161512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7915","id":2449161512,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6R-z0o","user":{"login":"lahodaj","id":51319204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5MjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51319204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj","html_url":"https://github.com/lahodaj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-31T06:58:28Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T06:58:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have no issue with adding an alternative UI for Find Usages, but I have a few comments:\r\n- there is no shortage of good ideas on what should or could be done, but there's not always enough people to do them.

I [asked](https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/jdk-dev/2024-October/thread.html#9469) on the JDK list a few weeks ago, there was also a proposal to [log on halt too](https://www.mail-archive.com/core-libs-dev@openjdk.org/msg19309.html) - but it was decided to not implement it there specifically due to the risk of the callback into application code (logger) which could fail for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, `-Xlog:safepoint+stats=info` could be also used to figure out the exit cause - however this isn't ideal for runtime.

Malicious or not - dependencies like that are filtered out by the java ecosystem, library supply chain reviews etc. You should not blindly use libraries you don't know - only protecting against exit/halt gives only a false sense of safety - a disappearing JVM is the smallest problem if you truly don't trust the code you execute.\r\n\r\n>for the clipboard, there's \"Paste from History\" (Ctrl-Shift-D), which I believe depends on the ability to listen on the clipboard, and the standard Swing clipboard is not firing events, so the history may be missing some entries.

I appreciate the insights on the current state of the \"Find Usages\" feature, particularly regarding the immediate display and incremental loading of results, which I hadn’t fully realized before. I also understand the limitations around development resources.\r\n\r\nHowever, several specific usability aspects still make this proposal relevant and valuable:\r\n1. **Bypassing the Configuration Dialog**: Currently, triggering \"Find Usages\" presents a configuration dialog where users must select search parameters before results are shown. This extra step can interrupt workflow, especially when quick searches are needed. The proposal aims to eliminate this dialog, showing results instantly, similar to how \"Go to File\" works. Users would still have the option to adjust parameters as needed, but with the default search executed immediately.\r\n2. **Results Filtering**: The current \"Find Usages\" feature lacks the ability to filter results, which would allow users to quickly narrow down results without the need to scan manually through the list with their eyes, as is necessary in the existing results panel.\r\n3. **Shortcut Accessibility**: While `ctrl+f7` (on Mac) opens \"Find Usages\", it’s not as accessible as `cmd+click`, which provides an intuitive experience directly in the code editor. This single-click approach mirrors shortcuts available in other IDEs, allowing users to work fluidly without leaving the code view.\r\n4. **Contextual Display of Usages**: A popup view displaying usages within context allows for quick previews without shifting focus to a dedicated panel, preserving workflow continuity.\r\n5. **Alternative Flat View for Usages**: The current hierarchical view of results can sometimes make it harder to scan results efficiently. A flat view listing class name, usage, and line number on each line could offer a clearer overview, minimizing navigation through nested structures.\r\n\r\nI’d be very interested in becoming a significant contributor to the implementation of this alternative UI and am keen on any guidance to help get started. It would be great to have some initial direction on contributing to NetBeans in this area so that I can be as effective as possible. I believe these adjustments would streamline the \"Find Usages\" experience, making it more intuitive and responsive to developer needs.\r\n\r\nI look forward to any further feedback on refining this idea!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2451727714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2452945447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7888#issuecomment-2452945447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7888","id":2452945447,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6SNPon","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-02T10:20:17Z","updated_at":"2024-11-02T10:20:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@trashgod could you please check whether #7932 fixes the issue for you?

The problem is, that in contrast to git CLI, github tries to be clever on squash. git CLI uses the author information of the commits, github tries to interpolate author information from the public information of the account, github thinks is responsible for this. We had multiple cases where commits ended with mutilated author information: no email or githubs broken pseudo email, nickname instead of real name. The function is just not trustworthy.\r\n\r\nThe second question: PRs are just copies of your local branches. The idea is, that you do a local squash of your commits. Pushing this modified branch is normally prohibited by the git client as it is a destructive action. You need to tell the git client that you want to do it by doing a \"forced\" push.\r\n\r\nInfo about squashing: https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash, info about force pushing: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---force (it is just a flag when pushing)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2453137636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
