@greghogan,\nI looked at the PR in more detail and I have some thoughts.\nFirst, why do we need a `Translate` class and `Translator` interface? Can't we simply add methods in the `Graph` class that wrap a `MapFunction` or receive it as an argument like in `mapVertices`?\nSecond, translating values is already supported by `mapVertices` and `mapEdges`. Couldn't we simply extend these methods to also support changing the vertex key types?\nLet me know what you think!

What are use cases for the extra context (namely, the label) provided by `mapVertices/Edges`? Implementations of `Translator` can be reused across functions whereas the `MapFunction` provided to `mapVertices/Edges` are specific to that method. Would `mapLabels` require two new `MapFunction` or use an interface like `Translator`?\n\n`Translator` is wrapped by a specific `MapFunction` for each `Translate` function.\n\nOnly one of the five current `Translate` functions operates on a `Graph`. `tranlateGraphLabels` could be moved to `Graph`, and there could be a `translateVertexValues` and `translateEdgeValues` also added to `Graph`. We don't always have a `Graph`, sometimes algorithms return a `DataSet` of vertices or edges, so having the static methods is helpful for these specialized `Vertex` and `Edge` operations.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/214782976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/214790629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1931#issuecomment-214790629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1931","id":214790629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDc5MDYyOQ==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T15:50:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T15:50:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

of `MapFunction`s can also be reused :)\nWhat I was thinking was to provide the translator simply as map functions, e.g. like `Tuple2ToVertexMap`. We can add them to `org.apache.flink.graph.utils` or create a subpackage for that. Then we can add the `translate*` methods to `Graph`. If someone wants to use the provided translator on a dataset of vertices or edges, they can simply do this with a mapper.\n\nMy concern is that we should try to be consistent with the existing Gelly API. e.g. something like `graph.translateIds(new LongValueToStringValue())` is Gelly-like, while\n`Translate.translateGraphLabels(graph, new LongValueToStringValue())` is not. Also, I think that this feature is simple enough to be implemented as a collection of map functions instead of a separate utility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/214819709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/214825734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1900#issuecomment-214825734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1900","id":214825734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDgyNTczNA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T17:48:32Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T17:48:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By reuse I was referring to needing `MapVertexValueLongToString` and `MapEdgeValueLongToString` since the current `Graph` methods operate at the level of `Vertex` and `Edge`.

I looked through the code changes. I was quite impressed that your PR touches nearly every class of the current API.\n\nBasically your changes seem to work, however, I'm not sure if we want to implement the validation phase for every scalar function ourselves. Actually, Calcite already comes with type inference, type checking and validation capabilities. I don't know if we want to reinvent the wheel at this point. Your approach inserts a layer under the Table API for doing the validation. However, instead, this layer could also translate the plan into a SQL tree (on top of RelNodes). We could then let Calcite do the work of validation.\n\nThis could also solve another problem that I faced when working on FLINK-3580. If you take a look at `StandardConvertletTable` of Calcite, you see that Calcite also does some conversions which we also need to implement ourselves if we do not base the Table API on top of SQL.\n\nWe need to discuss how we want to proceed.

I also finished a first pass over the PR. \n\nI'd like to propose a third alternative, in addition to the custom validation phase (this PR) and generating `SqlNode`s and using Calcite's validator. Both approaches would mean that the validation happens before the logical plan is translated into a `RelNode`. I think it would be good to eagerly check each method call of the Table API. This would make debugging easier, because exceptions would be thrown where the error is caused. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I think we would not lose validation coverage compared to the coverage this PR if we do eager validation? It might also be easier, because we do not need the recursive operator traversal (still the expression traversal though). Maybe we can even directly translate to `RelNode`s after validation, just like we do right now. I think a lot of this PR could be used for eager validation, not sure if it would be easily possible with the `SqlNode` validation approach. \nWhat do you think about eagerly validation, @yjshen and @twalthr?\n\nWhile reviewing the PR, I noticed that some classes seem to be partially derived from Spark's code base (e.g., `TreeNode` and `RuleExecutor`).
