So this is fine but there's another issue. The reason why it has become a blocker for the latest release candidate is that `bro`, `snort`, and `yaf` is already aggregated.\r\n\r\nAnd the topology info for the three of them coming back from the `storm` endpoint is just fine. It says it's `ACTIVE` but since the UI doesn't get any information about their \"group\", it's unable to render the three sensors as they are grouped together. \r\n\r\nSo currently, the name of the topology item regarding the three aforementioned sensors is \"bro__snort__yaf\" but there is no group with the same name so the UI can't figure it's a group and the three sensors belong to it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/487922557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/487950714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1396#issuecomment-487950714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1396","id":487950714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4Nzk1MDcxNA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T13:24:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T13:24:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You're correct @ruffle1986.

Since with these changes we no longer rely on Vagrant to kick-off Ansible, we could alter the steps so that it first completes the build and packaging and then only after that is done, it launches the VM.  That way we don't have the two fighting for memory at the same time.\r\n\r\nFirst off, does that sound like a reasonable thing to do @ottobackwards ?  If so, is it a heavy lift we should hold off on for a follow-on PR?  Or is it just a simple re-ordering of some of the actions in `metron-up.sh`?\r\n\r\nEdit: We should probably just get the basics working here before going on changing anything else drastically.

I have a question about the implementation details in the test changes around TestZKServer.runWithZK. We generally try to keep our start/stop for beefier components to the @Before/AfterClass scope with intermediate cleanup at the individual test level so that we manage overall build times. It looks like this splits up some tests  (to be clear, I'm very much in favor of taking something named `test` and splitting it into well named units for clarity) and does a full spin up and teardown of ZK for every individual test. That's probably not what we want. Can you talk to that a bit more?

Everyone in the UI team has worked on this. The reason why you can see my name everywhere is because I had to clean the commit history last year as well because it was messed. It seems like it's the nature of this long living feature branch and there must be something wrong with our approach to keep it up-to-date with the master. First I tried rebasing it with master but it caused headaches when others wanted to have the latest version on their local computer. Then we agreed on using merging commits to make it obvious what was going on. \r\n\r\nWe already have a discussion thread on this. Unfortunately I couldn't find it the mailing list but remember? This was the thread where we introduced the benefits of a better state management strategy and a new module called Ngrx. As I can remember, you liked the idea and we got the green light. \r\n\r\nHowever the commit history is messed up, once it's solved, I think it's enough to introduce this change set in one feature branch because it's one feature called Parser Aggregation.\r\n\r\nFor the record, @merrimanr reviewed it a few months ago and he liked the approach how we achieved better state management. He reported a few bugs and we also found a few after manual testing and we also found some uncovered edge cases.
