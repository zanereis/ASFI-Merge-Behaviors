Interesting point in regards to Metadata, I think that it makes sense to go that route.

I haven't had a chance to test this on older versions, I was planning to take a look over the weekend, but in my `tesseract 4.0.0-beta.1` (latest on Ubuntu 18.04) and psm 0 I get the OSD info in `stdout`, not `stderr`, if the output format is specified as `stdout`, and in the `$out.osd` if output is `$out`.
