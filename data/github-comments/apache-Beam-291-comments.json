I think either way the default/stub/mock should already be set up in `DoFnInvokersTest`. Or maybe those methods are in ByteBuddyDoFnInvokerFactoryTest, which covers the same logic since `DoFnInvokers` right now just delegates to it.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4482#-:-L3iZd3FYhfkp9VukC8_:b-hzgnuz)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360555991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360556392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4478#issuecomment-360556392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4478","id":360556392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDU1NjM5Mg==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T18:28:38Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T18:28:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There are reasons why a user my actually want to know what files were staged and this could be one way for them to get it.

Separately, it seems like we should just map SQL types to existing Beam coders unless we know these are a big win. Mostly, I expect they are not, reading their code. Since encoding/decoding can dominate a CPU-bound pipeline and shuffle costs are also important, we should measure this.\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/SqlTypeCoder.java, line 49 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4488#-L3j7MTEmlcRb30WoZWk:-L3j7MTEmlcRb30WoZWl:b-k4rq3w) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b96407aa84967a71caef6e88db35c603b7f0557c/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/SqlTypeCoder.java#L49)):*\n> ```Java\n>  * <p>Relies on URN for equality and hashcode.\n>  */\n> public class SqlTypeCoder extends CustomCoder<Object> {\n> ```\n\nA `CustomCoder` is really a shorthand/shortcut for users, to mean \"A coder that only the Java SDK understands and is serialized via Java serialization\".\n\nI had thought there was a registry from coder class to translator. I think we need such a thing. So coders are unchanged and the URN would like in the `CoderTranslator`. Basically a registry with a `Map<Class<? extends Coder>, CoderTranslator>` to see how to turn a coder into a proto and then a `Map<URN, CoderTranslator>` to know how to turn it back into a Java coder.\n\n@tgroh didn't you do something along these lines?\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/example/BeamSqlExample.java, line 52 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4488#-L3j8EwqKTytaJhcWPXm:-L3j8EwqKTytaJhcWPXn:b9y13yf) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b96407aa84967a71caef6e88db35c603b7f0557c/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/example/BeamSqlExample.java#L52)):*\n> ```Java\n> \n>     //define the input row format\n>     BeamRecordType type = BeamRecordSqlType\n> ```\n\n+1 nice and readable\n\n---\n\n*[sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rel/BeamJoinRel.java, line 130 at r1](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4488#-L3j8SlQ8tuIfJjj5kpH:-L3j8SlQ8tuIfJjj5kpI:b-clvfq) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b96407aa84967a71caef6e88db35c603b7f0557c/sdks/java/extensions/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/sql/impl/rel/BeamJoinRel.java#L130)):*\n> ```Java\n>       types.add(leftRowType.getFieldCoder(pairs.get(i).getKey()));\n>     }\n>     BeamRecordType extractKeyRowType = new BeamRecordType(names, types);\n> ```\n\nThis reads like unusually low-level code for what it does.

In samza, this will decide the number of tasks for a job. \n\nWhat I was saying (I think Kenneth meant the same) is that it'll be super nice that BEAM provides an API for the source to split into a default number, like the number of partitions in Kafka. So as a user, he doesn't need to bother finding out the number of each input kafka topic parittions when he runs the job. For LinkedIn, this is very valuable since a Kafka topic might have different partitions in different fabrics, so a default will be very helpful to the users. That's also the behavior in Samza today if the user doesn't provide a customized grouper of partitions: each partition becomes a task (or a split in this case).\n</blockquote></details>\n\nThanks. I am not sure if I you would like me to address any specific question. Please let me know.  If the purpose is to let the user set number of tasks for a job, may be the option could be named '(max)NumberOfTasks'. I am just thinking aloud with little overall context. \n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4340)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360605147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360608617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4483#issuecomment-360608617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4483","id":360608617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDYwODYxNw==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T21:37:14Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T21:37:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Apologies, forgot to actually push the changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360608617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360619209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4417#issuecomment-360619209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4417","id":360619209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDYxOTIwOQ==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T22:17:23Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T22:17:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to merge this because it seems to help for Apex runner and is harmless otherwise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360619209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/360622187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4226#issuecomment-360622187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4226","id":360622187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDYyMjE4Nw==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T22:29:11Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T22:29:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@justintumale Why was this PR closed?

For example,`BeamSqlExpression`'s output type currently is Calcite's `SqlTypeName`.

Even without schema, by just updating low level things like output types to the coders should remove the need of reverse mapping.
