I'm ok to extend the discussion further before pulling this commit. So I'll reply on my proposal doc.\n</blockquote></details>\n\nIt may also be helpful to have a quick discussion on slack to iterate on what exactly the proposal is, and then update the list. Specifically, it seems like one possible path forward is to move towards a model where all Beam metrics delegate directly to some underlying metrics implementation and then runner never gets involved.\n\nSuch a model would lose the ability to support committed metrics (we would need to make that decision consciously) but would then simplify the metrics implementations by allowing allowing the SDK to connect metrics to a metrics reporter, and then it is just a matter of implementing a Dropwizard metrics reporter. This would still mean that the Dropwizard library is only a dependency of the Dropwizard metrics reporter, not the base metrics interfaces.\n\n---\n\n*[runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterCell.java, line 38 at r4](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555#-Kp1AGjycjkaup_Fr4lL:-KpGXh_5IPoTAmf1e0Fn:bvshfbz) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/aa9bff62c8b88cc8c6a36ec224b799d7217dbb4d/runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterCell.java#L38)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, unsleepy22 (Cody) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nIt's ok for runners to implement meters without using a dropwizard Meter because my implementation only passes the Meter.count() to runners and based on the count, the runners are free to implement their own meters.\n</blockquote></details>\n\nThe meter count isn't enough to determine the rate without knowing at what points in time those events occurred. This makes it impossible for runners to implement their own meters.\n\n---\n\n*[runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterData.java, line 49 at r4](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555#-Kp1Adm0vIK3FzCRiXe0:-KpGY7H9gXTDr74KvTmc:b5tvscc) ([raw file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/aa9bff62c8b88cc8c6a36ec224b799d7217dbb4d/runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/MeterData.java#L49)):*\n<details><summary><i>Previously, unsleepy22 (Cody) wrote…</i></summary><blockquote>\n\nThis is a point we need to consider: In a distributed application, is the sum of `mean` rates  referable? Or can we calculate an accurate sum of mean rates? Especially for meters with different start times. I think m1,m5,m15 are more referable numbers. Even so, I still think your example is reasonable acceptable because the mean rate of each meter depicts the average rate calculated so far, i.e, an static value at 10:00, it makes sense to sum them together to get a total mean rate for all meters at that time.\n\nFor the second problem, I'm not sure about the use case, could you take an example? \n</blockquote></details>\n\nI don't the sum of mean rates is meaningful, but the \"total rate\" does make sense. This is why just adding the means isn't enough to compute the total rate.\n\n---\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/3555)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io

only transform where evaluating it correctly uses additional inputs (specifically, non-additional inputs). I think the right way to do this is probably to just put the main input in the payload and have the evaluator use that.\r\n - Hitting the DisplayData methods to get them to crash, to not regress validation, while leaving them out of the proto since it isn't on the critical path.
