To me it seems it should not contain any other schedulers too. The executor does not need any scheduler jars, since the scheduler starts before executors and the scheduler itself launches all the executors. When scheduler is running as a service it is contacted using scheduler independent http calls. In the other non-service cases, the scheduler is embedded in the client (https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/tools/rules/heron_client.bzl#L32). Perhaps this needs to be asked in a new issue. \r\n@maosongfu, @kramasamy, @neng WDYT?\r\n\r\nw.r.t. this issue, the solution would be add the non-service scheduler (aurora in this case) to the `healthmgr` jar. However I am not sure if inclusion of aurora jar is sufficient. Any files needed by aurora scheduler need to be present on `container-0`. Is that feasible?\r\n@huijunw Are you able to run the `healthmgr` in
