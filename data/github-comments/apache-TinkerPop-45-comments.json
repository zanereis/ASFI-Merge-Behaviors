Micro benchmarks can sometimes be tricky to design and  interpret. It appears that Throughput is calculated over all threads (Fork=3) whereas AverageTime is per op, single thread so it's not the actual inverse of each other. Also for throughput, the actual boost here is (598/580) 3% not 10%.  The variance wasn't published but if it's anything like the 3% for Average Time, then the boost is marginal. I don't think it will be perceptible unless it's over a huge dataset but even then there are so many other things to contend with. The throughput benchmark points to how quickly that performance boost dissipates.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think we can all agree that in general not having a method call overhead is going to be slightly faster.

get.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/445273536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/445795440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1001#issuecomment-445795440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1001","id":445795440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTc5NTQ0MA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T12:15:14Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T12:15:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've

believe that I need to revert/modify some of these changes. For classes that are designed for extension, like `GraphStep` it's possible that a method called in the subclass could be overridden to not use the field (somewhat unlikely in these cases but remotely possible) in which case the behavior we've had would be broken. I intend to go through each change and either fully revert it or in cases where the performance improvement is important (i.e. GraphSON) I will keep the change but add a `final` to the method declaration to ensure that it's not overridden with the expectation that it will alter behavior somewhere else. The use of `final` is technically a breaking change so it should probably only happen on `master`.  I'm not sure what that means for #1014 at this point.

Is there any reason you could not convert that into a test as part of this PR so that we have some insurance against regression?\r\n\r\n> ideally the client (who handle the connection pool) should allocate and free the connections and not the connection itself\r\n\r\nI think your approach is fine, but I suppose that the `Client` which borrows the `Connection` should be the thing to return it to the pool. If you felt like refactoring that at some point I think that approach would be ok as well.

In my experience, the use for dynamic pools is very limited. Usually when there is spike in requests, opening new connections can lead to a latency with no added benefit (there is a limited number of requests that a server can process at any given time).\r\n\r\nYou mean that the pool should simply have a fixed size instead? Wasn't that what you asked for in TINKERPOP-1774:\r\n\r\n> Similar to the java connection pool, we should limit the maximum amount of connections and start with a minimum number.\r\n\r\nor what do you mean exactly with dynamic pool sizes?\r\n\r\nI don't really have a strong opinion on that. My assumptions was just that it's probably hard for users to set a good value for the size. Dynamic pool sizes basically avoid this as the pool will automatically grow to a size that is big enough to handle the number of parallel requests the application typically uses. Later on, we could also add a mechanism to remove idle connections if they were only created because of a spike in requests as too many idle connection seem to be problematic with certain providers (especially CosmosDB, judging from the tickets we currently have open). Although this mechanism would of course make the latency problem even worse for spikes when the connections were already closed again since the last spike.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/448621688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/448625959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1016#issuecomment-448625959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1016","id":448625959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODYyNTk1OQ==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-19T15:02:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T15:02:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The behaviour that motivated TINKERPOP-1774 was the unbounded number of connections that was being created, but it's true that references the java driver as the reference implementation, sorry about that.\r\n\r\nI think having a fixed amount of connections leads to a predictable behaviour (latency / resource provisioning / etc) and a simpler implementation.

I just wanted to wait for another review and not use lazy consensus as the change isn't exactly trivial and also because of the holidays where probably not so many contributors had the chance to review this. However, if you want to start the release process, then this PR shouldn't stop it in my opinion. So, I can merge this tomorrow morning or later today.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/450736628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/450736955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1016#issuecomment-450736955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1016","id":450736955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDczNjk1NQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-01T15:10:45Z","updated_at":"2019-01-01T15:10:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok - i have to start with 3.2.11 first so it will be a bit before i get to 3.4.0. you have some time to finish up.
