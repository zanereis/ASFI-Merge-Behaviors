Well, I understand that this TansactionManager is used by Shardingsphere internal to commit to the backend database servers especially in the case of splitting a origin insert sql statment into two or more statments and routing to the different databases, which should be running with XA or SEAT transaction mode to make the data consistency. @RaigorJiang , is it right ?\r\n> \r\n> In @roodkcab scenario, it seems that he wants to use a XA transaction in the application and connect to the shardingsphere-proxy. So @roodkcab can you describe your question in more detail ? e.g. what is your application want to do in XA transaction ?\r\n\r\nright, I have to use XA statements without jdbc. It's actually some PHP scripts connect to shardingsphere-proxy with PDO extension, using XA statements to get distribution transaction done.\r\n\r\nI've solved this problem by using a SchemaAssignedDatabaseHandler in TransactionBackendHandlerFactory when tclStatement is  an instance of MySQLXAStatement.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1700820/135231739-fd5e3f65-7268-4fe4-97d6-a8636ad9be6c.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/929957228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/929973888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/12771#issuecomment-929973888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/12771","id":929973888,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M43bkaA","user":{"login":"zhfeng","id":1246139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDYxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1246139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-29T08:52:06Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T08:52:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's nice to hear that you resolved this issue.
