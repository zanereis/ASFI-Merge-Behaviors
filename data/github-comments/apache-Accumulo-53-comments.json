This was to deal with code that should either be part of the public API/SPI or removed from configuration properties, like I did with the MemoryManger.  We had a property for users to write their own MemoryManager but the interface used server components that were not user friendly.  \r\n\r\nI think I will have to do the same with the interfaces in org.apache.accumulo.server.security.handler classes (Authenticator, Authorizor, PermissionHandler).  These interfaces are called when Accumulo executes important security procedures (like creating users, initializing a system) but they really only work internally.  It feels like they were added to add the ability for Kerberos to work with the default Zookeeper behavior.  I don't know how we can rework these interfaces to extend this behavior without completely rewriting the interfaces to work in the SPI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/703807374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/703846749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1659#issuecomment-703846749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1659","id":703846749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzg0Njc0OQ==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-05T19:40:36Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T19:41:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner @ctubbsii I came up with one solution in #1721 to solve the issues with the security interfaces.

Even if there was an easy way to time out before that, we would probably end up with false negatives (we conclude that ZK is not running when it really is, but we didn't give it enough time to connect). If tests are set to time out before 2x ZK timeout, I'm surprised we don't have more flaky tests. I would consider 2x ZK timeout to be the minimum time we should wait for a test to finish (but it's not worth changing it if they are working today).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/705091620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/705092106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1718#issuecomment-705092106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1718","id":705092106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTA5MjEwNg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-07T17:43:10Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T17:43:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It's possible there's not a good way to fail fast, and there's nothing to be done for this ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/705092106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/705099412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1718#issuecomment-705099412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1718","id":705099412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTA5OTQxMg==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-07T17:57:02Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T17:57:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You should be able to set the ```.zkTimeout()``` [here](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/3fd5cad92f9b63ac19e4466f3f2d5237b905262c/test/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/harness/conf/StandaloneAccumuloClusterConfiguration.java#L110) on the ClientInfo.

Ideally, I would be able to check for manager status or something like that before trying to connect to zookeeper so I could fail quicker but I don't know if that is possible.\r\n\r\nIt's not worth it to check the manager status if you can't connect to ZK. If it can't connect to ZK, then you wouldn't be able to connect to the manager either. I think this is fine, as-is. @milleruntime what do you think?

However, a `Stream` would only give us a stream of `Entry<Key, Value>`, and a `forEach` for that wouldn't be as useful as one with a `BiConsumer`, like the `Map` interface provides. It might be nice to have both eventually. However, this can be done independently without worrying about all the messiness that comes with decisions about streams (like what to do with `.stream().parallel()`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/712649953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
