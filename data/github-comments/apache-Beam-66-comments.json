does not guarantee that it can be closed multiple times -- that's `Closeable`.\r\n\r\nGood catch, but this fix doesn't go all the way. Possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. The double-close is happening because we allocate two different `AutoCloseable` objects in the try-with-resources block. Inline `writer` into the allocation for `printWriter`, so that there is only one close.\r\n\r\n2. If we don't want to use try-with-resources, we should properly handle failures. E.g., make finer-grained `try` blocks and call close in the right `catch` blocks.

Let's discuss on the mailing list the issue of how to deal with transforms that assume that they're running in a particular OS environment, and then resume this review. In particular I'd like to see the following questions addressed:\r\n\r\n- How should such transforms be documented? Should they say they're only guaranteed to work in runners X,Y,Z? Should they just say this is best-effort and it is up to the user to ensure that the command makes sense in the environment provided by the runner this user uses, and Beam per se makes no guarantees whatsoever?\r\n- Should runners in general be documenting and providing guarantees on the execution environment?\r\n- Should pipelines be allowed to control the execution environment? (we have `filesToStage`)\r\n- Where should such environment-dependent transforms (like this one) be placed in the Beam source code tree?\r\n- What are the implications of having non-portable transforms like this at all? E.g., obviously, anything that uses this transform also becomes non-portable.\r\n\r\nAssuming these issues are resolved, I'm wondering if a transform is needed at all. It seems like all the nontrivial code is in ExecFn.processElement() - would it be sufficient to provide a single static function \"String executeCommand(String command, String workingDirectory, long timeout)\" and let the user wrap it into DoFn's whichever way makes most sense in their pipeline?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/263698184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/263726746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1189#issuecomment-263726746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1189","id":263726746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzcyNjc0Ng==","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-29T22:53:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T22:53:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PTAL

Why do you need to wait to start the bundle, given that the bundle's arrival is what caused the evaluator to exist?\r\n\r\nPatterns of `start()` and `finish()` are nicely expressed as an object representing the start-to-finish lifecycle, a la `Closeable` or Python's context managers whenever possible. It is much less error prone, hence its popularization. Even without language support, it is pretty easy to use a similar discipline.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/264033509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/264035234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1473#issuecomment-264035234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1473","id":264035234,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDAzNTIzNA==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-30T23:55:03Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T23:55:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My motivating example was code related to Splittable DoFn that looks like this:\r\n```\r\nevaluator = ParDoEvaluator.create(processFn)\r\n...wire up processFn with evaluator...\r\nprocessFn.setup()\r\nreturn evaluator;\r\n```\r\nand this was failing cause `ParDoEvaluator.create()` called `processFn.startBundle()` and that expects `setup()` to already be called.\r\n\r\nI can just call `setup()` earlier, but it logically makes more sense to call `setup()` on a fully prepared `processFn`.\r\n\r\nI like the start-to-finish lifecycle pattern, but it doesn't play well with cyclic dependencies like this, where you need to wire some objects together and only then kick off the processing.\r\n\r\n@tgroh WDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/264035234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/264037664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1470#issuecomment-264037664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1470","id":264037664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDAzNzY2NA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T00:08:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T00:08:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That was fast!
