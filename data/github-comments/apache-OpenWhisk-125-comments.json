For environments with a limited number of functions this change isn't a big deal. But, if your OpenWhisk installation has many thousands of different functions that get invoked within the current 5 minute cache timeout then this may be an issue.\r\n\r\nUntil or unless we test filesystem-based attachment caching, we may want to set a `maximumWeight` or `maximumSize` on the `Caffeine` cache instances so that cached attachments get evicted before relying on the JVM garbage collection of soft references and/or expiration time.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the performance improvement for Java functions under load is worth figuring out these other details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/381577307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/381578265","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2855#issuecomment-381578265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2855","id":381578265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTU3ODI2NQ==","user":{"login":"bbrowning","id":56071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrowning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-16T12:13:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T12:13:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Speaking of performance improvements, I thought I'd share some basic throughput numbers here.
