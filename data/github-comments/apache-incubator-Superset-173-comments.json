If that's the intent here, I think it would be smart to focus solely on ES 6.3.0+ -- am I understanding this correctly?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/427618778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/427681108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/785#issuecomment-427681108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/785","id":427681108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzY4MTEwOA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-07T19:45:13Z","updated_at":"2018-10-07T19:45:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@napjon I don't think the problem you are describing is related.

Since our web servers are stateless, the pandas dataframe needs to be brought up in memory from the network prior to performing aggregations / filters.

It doesn't matter if you open a 100MB or 2TB file, it is practically for free\r\n\r\nI always planned to add Arrow support, but I never saw the same performance, so didn't bother yet. However, for compatibility, it would be great to have.\r\n\r\nThere is also a (stateless) vaex server for accessing remote datasets and build on top of that a distributed part (although less mature) which is almost trivial since almost everything vaex computes is embarrassingly parallel.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know if a connector for vaex is potentially interesting. I don't know much about Druid's performance, so I don't know how fast it could produce the data for these visualizations I produced. If it would be an order of magnitude, it could be interesting, otherwise probably not worth the effort, maybe you have some statistics on this.\r\n\r\nAlso, to really make superset work well with vaex, it probably needs some custom viz as well, like something I demonstrate here:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bP-JBbjwLM8?t=1125 (the 150 million taxi dataset)\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bP-JBbjwLM8?t=1741 (1 bilion stars)\r\nWhich is similar to the Heatmap viz, except here it will use numerical data with limits/bounds, and adds the ability to zoom/pan (and select/filter).\r\nAgain, here I don't know if this is potentially interesting for superset.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMaarten\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/427744413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/427752568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1866#issuecomment-427752568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1866","id":427752568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzc1MjU2OA==","user":{"login":"mohan-kumar","id":7701038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDEwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7701038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar","html_url":"https://github.com/mohan-kumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohan-kumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T08:14:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T08:14:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Webgardener \r\nyour config for nginx works for almost all links except filters in the dashboard.\r\nFilters are not working.
