From source-code you can see that logging is mostly enabled on pluggable components as storage and collectors, if you're expecting to see something specific, check here https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/search?q=LoggerFactory.&unscoped_q=LoggerFactory where we use logging and if something doesn't look right, please open an issue.\r\n\r\nIf you're using memory storage (default), then you'll probably not get much logs tho. To check loggers level: http://localhost:9411/actuator/loggers e.g. if you want to enable ALL logs, try `--logging.level.ROOT=TRACE`\r\n\r\nIf you're interested on `zipkin-server` logic behaviour, I'd recommend to look at metrics we expose instead of logs: http://localhost:9411/actuator/prometheus or http://localhost:9411/actuator/metrics or self-tracing capabilities. We focus on making zipkin easier to operate, and metrics and self-tracing seems enough for it. For debugging we have testing. Adding more logging on this component is not something we have received much requests about and personally I don't think it will get prioritize on the short term.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/530792798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/530821938","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2798#issuecomment-530821938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2798","id":530821938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDgyMTkzOA==","user":{"login":"fbeaufume","id":25341695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQxNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25341695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume","html_url":"https://github.com/fbeaufume","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fbeaufume/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T13:19:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T13:19:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @jeqo for the feedback.\r\n\r\nI guess this is not a bug anymore, but maybe a feature request to add some logs, or in the mean time mention in https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server that no logs are produced by the core and the in-memory storage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/530821938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/530882796","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2798#issuecomment-530882796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2798","id":530882796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDg4Mjc5Ng==","user":{"login":"jeqo","id":6180701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODA3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6180701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo","html_url":"https://github.com/jeqo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeqo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T15:37:01Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T15:37:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"IMO I don't think it's worth mentioning we don't log a component, the same way we don't mention when we do log them.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, test-cases are enough for explaining behavior, debugging and reproducing errors we should fix; I won't expect someone adding logs just for the sake of logging.

This is an instrumentation bug. With that fixed, the order should be consistent. Check you are running all the orders, then check what is generating the SERVER span with \"id\": \"408ee7f252391ae6\",. This is not setting span.shared, which it should and something that brave's default middleware does. Once you identify that component, if it is sleuth and running the latest version of sleuth than raise a bug if still persists.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/532437119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/532444203","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2805#issuecomment-532444203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2805","id":532444203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjQ0NDIwMw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-17T23:48:25Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T23:48:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A
