express a subset of the world may be interesting for everyone\r\n- the custom fab security should imho be a different package and just a configuration for your installation, not something you'll be shipping with superset\r\n- for the templates you should use something like this i think https://buxty.com/b/2012/05/custom-template-folders-with-flask/\r\n- the color configuration changes seems

This is\nconfusing for new users who haven't got used to it, and it's also a\npotential area for a nice feature.\n**Potential Fixes:** For any viz which sets *is_timeseries* to false we\ngrey out the time grain selector to avoid confusion. In addition for the\ntable viz, it would be great to toggle whether the time grain is used or\nnot. When it is used, it functions as an additional *Group By* fields and\nbecomes the first column of the table.\n\nOn Sun, 22 Jan 2017 at 10:54 Riccardo Magliocchetti <\nnotifications@github.com>
