formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.000\r\neach=2021-11-09 20:35:03.67, localDateTime=2021-11-09T20:35:03, formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.000\r\neach=2021-11-09 20:35:03.678, localDateTime=2021-11-09T20:35:03, formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.000\r\n```\r\nLooks the milliseconds are erased.\r\n\r\nSince `datetime-lower` and `datetime-upper` could specify milliseconds, I'm afraid it might cause issue. e.g.\r\n```\r\ndatetime-lower=2020-01-01 00:00:00.456\r\ndatetime-upper=2020-01-01 00:00:00.789\r\n```\r\nFor value `2020-01-01 00:00:00.123` and `2020-01-01 00:00:00.890`, which sharding will it be routed to?\r\nI suggest to add related unit test to verify it. I'll mark it in review comment.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1023840928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1023846860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/15069#issuecomment-1023846860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15069","id":1023846860,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M49BqnM","user":{"login":"yx9o","id":12792261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzkyMjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12792261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o","html_url":"https://github.com/yx9o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yx9o/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T03:14:50Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T03:14:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

\r\n- I did originally plan to change `private static final DateTimeFormatter DATE_TIME_FORMAT`, the following may be what you want. `Java8 LocalTime` is different from `MySQL DateTime`, the time precision of `MySQL DateTime` supports up to 6 decimal places. is the reason for `.appendFraction(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND,0,6,true)` in the test case.\r\n````java\r\nprivate void pr15131ParseTest() {\r\n       DateTimeFormatter dateTimeFormatter = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()\r\n                .appendPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\")\r\n                .appendFraction(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND,0,6,true)\r\n                .toFormatter();\r\n        List<String> timeStrings = Arrays.asList(\"2021-11-09 20:35:03\", \"2021-11-09 20:35:03.6\", \"2021-11-09 20:35:03.67\", \" 2021-11-09 20:35:03.678\");\r\n        for (String each : timeStrings) {\r\n            LocalDateTime localDateTime = LocalDateTime.from(dateTimeFormatter.parse(each, new ParsePosition(0)));\r\n            String formatted = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS\").format(localDateTime.toInstant(ZoneOffset.of(\"+8\")).toEpochMilli());\r\n            log.info(\"each={}, localDateTime={}, formatted={}\", each, localDateTime, formatted);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\nturn out\r\n````java\r\neach=2021-11-09 20:35:03, localDateTime=2021-11-09T20:35:03, formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.000\r\neach=2021-11-09 20:35:03.6, localDateTime=2021-11-09T20:35:03.600, formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.600\r\neach=2021-11-09 20:35:03.67, localDateTime=2021-11-09T20:35:03.670, formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.670\r\neach=2021-11-09 20:35:03.678, localDateTime=2021-11-09T20:35:03.678, formatted=2021-11-09 20:35:03.678\r\n````\r\n- For the test that needs to be added, I think I should explain, because the unit of `AutoIntervalShardingAlgorithm` is only `seconds`, it does not allow to modify this unit. And there is a step in the function `Duration.between(dateTimeLower, dateValueFirst).toMillis() / 1000;` , this will automatically erase all time precision after the second. I've provided my test within this `pull request`, proving that this step will cause something like `2021-10-11 00:00:00.123` Time maps to `2021-10-11 00:00:00`.\r\n````java\r\n public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        DateTimeFormatter DATE_TIME_FORMAT = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()\r\n                .appendPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\")\r\n                .appendFraction(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND,0,3,true)\r\n                .toFormatter();\r\n        LocalDateTime dateTimeLower = LocalDateTime.parse(\"2020-01-01 00:00:00\", DATE_TIME_FORMAT);\r\n        LocalDateTime dateValueFirst = LocalDateTime.parse(\"2021-10-11 00:00:00\", DATE_TIME_FORMAT);\r\n        LocalDateTime dateValueSecond = LocalDateTime.parse(\"2021-10-11 00:00:00.123\", DATE_TIME_FORMAT);\r\n        long shardingValueFirst = Duration.between(dateTimeLower, dateValueFirst).toMillis() / 1000;\r\n        System.out.println(\"shardingValueFirst-->\"+shardingValueFirst);\r\n        long shardingValueSecond = Duration.between(dateTimeLower, dateValueFirst).toMillis() / 1000;\r\n        System.out.println(\"shardingValueSecond-->\"+shardingValueSecond);\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n- I will not propose changes like `Duration.between(dateTimeLower, dateValueFirst).toNanos() / 1000;` in this PR, because in my practice this change is completely different from the original intention of this class, Maybe a new algorithm class is needed to deal with nanoseconds.\r\n- I just want to make the read value with milliseconds usable by the algorithm class instead of throwing an exception `could not be parsed`. So in the new commit I removed `private` for `Property` A change to the `private LocalDateTime getDateTime()` function, which is an attempt of mine in the past, and it turns out that this change is not necessary. I changed the description of the documentation synchronously.\r\n- I submit a new `commit` for such issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1023965291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1023969551","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15140#issuecomment-1023969551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15140","id":1023969551,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M49CIkP","user":{"login":"zzs52","id":72447048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDQ3MDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72447048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52","html_url":"https://github.com/zzs52","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzs52/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T07:54:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T07:54:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can

A better way is to use both JDBC and Proxy through the Mode feature. Proxy is responsible for managing configuration and DDL operations, and JDBC reads these configurations through Mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1024775857/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1024801610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/15154#issuecomment-1024801610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/15154","id":1024801610,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M49FTtK","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T01:40:03Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T01:40:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
