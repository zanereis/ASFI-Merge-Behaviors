: Thanks for the patch. I am actually not sure if we should patch the handling of response parsing error this way. If the parsing fails due to a Kafka bug, we should just fix the bug in the source. Otherwise, we'd expect the parsing of the receive to always succeed and there is no need to add any additional logic.\n\nWhen there is a bug that causes parsing to fail, currently, we just throw an exception back to the caller. This is probably what we want, instead of hiding the error from the user. Also, the patch makes the code more complicated. For example, I am not if we should add failReceive() to Selector since the parsing failure happens at NetworkClient level.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199329868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199363536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/719#issuecomment-199363536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/719","id":199363536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTM2MzUzNg==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-21T16:21:06Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T16:21:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure we want this behavior -- it's different than the behavior of `java.util.Properties` which seems like it will just be confusing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199363536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199366361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/145#issuecomment-199366361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/145","id":199366361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTM2NjM2MQ==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-21T16:27:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T16:27:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@onurkaraman : Do you want to take a look?

@guozhangwang @ewencp for review.\n\nThis patch changes the asynchronous commit behavior to try and force the send during the commitAsync() call itself. Prior to this patch, we simply queued the commit to be sent in poll(), which causes send failures because NetworkClient doesn't allow more than one request to be sent on each invocation of poll() and ConsumerNetworkClient simply fails the rest. Based on my testing, this makes the problem go away in practice and also has the nice side effect of allowing heartbeats to be sent in commitAsync().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/199464813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
