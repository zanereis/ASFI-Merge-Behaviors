A few comments/thoughts: \r\n\r\n1. It's also worth pointing out that the current relative timestamp sometimes uses _now_ and other times uses _today_ as the reference point which is somewhat confusing.\r\n\r\n2. Related to SIP-15 should we align on supporting dates and timestamps or just make everything timestamps? I proposed the former in SIP-15 but I'm not opposed to the later. Note there are other temporal grains; week, month, quarter, year etc. however we (and other BI tools) normally just encode these as dates (or timestamps), i.e., `2019-01` or `2019-Q1` is defined as `2019-01-01`.\r\n\r\n3. For `DAY` I'm not sure that  \"Today so far (now)\" should reference now as we're talking about dates and not times. I'm uncertain whether it should be `[, today)` (exclusive of today) or `[, tomorrow)` (inclusive of today). \r\n\r\n4. We need to ensure that the time window is apparent when the widget is closed.\r\n\r\n5. From a UX perspective we're really specifying a time window either as: i) a start and and end, ii) a start with a duration, or iii) and end with a duration, and was wondering whether there was merit in trying to design/encode this into the widget somehow (which ties into #4).  \r\n\r\n6. We also have a time grain selector and wonder if it make sense to keep these decoupled or somehow combine them. I guess you could have a monthly time grain but the time filter is based on years (as opposed to months).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/497037835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/497040337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7604#issuecomment-497040337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7604","id":497040337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzA0MDMzNw==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T17:47:50Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T17:47:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also [here](https://docs.looker.com/reference/filter-expressions) is Looker's various date/time filters which provide some additional context regarding the various patterns they support.

I recently opened a PR which solves a subset of this problem, namely the now/today one ( #7525 ), but I do feel that Superset would benefit a lot from adding more functionality in this space. I would like to add that `Last Month` or similar might mean very different things to different people; for one it means a moving window(e.g. `2019-04-30` to `2019-05-29`) , while for others it usually means last full period (`2019-05-01` to `Today`). This is often tightly coupled with time grains, and probably benefits from anecdotal analysis where the current functionality was insufficient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/497051108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/497052519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7433#issuecomment-497052519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7433","id":497052519,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzA1MjUxOQ==","user":{"login":"michellethomas","id":817955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/817955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas","html_url":"https://github.com/michellethomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T18:20:30Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T18:20:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Set the threshold to 0% based on @DiggidyDave's suggestion and removed ignore directory.

In the future when proposing a change to UX of the tool please add the label [design-review](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/labels/design-review). \r\n\r\n1. The number of defaults under for example the Default - Today tab is overwhelming. We should draw a thoughtful line around how many options we provide users. The more choices a user is presented with, the longer the user will take to reach a decision. Check out [Hick's Law](https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law).\r\n2. This feels like a move towards supporting power user needs over general usability. It should be noted this provides greater friction for the non-power user. Having to select Today, Day, Week of Month first to find a specific default is not as user friendly/discoverable as it exists today. I question if some aspects of this should this live behind a more advanced option and/or feature flag for the time filter?\r\n3. I appreciate that you're trying to provide greater clarity of the selected time range for the user. The placement of the what I would suggest calling \"Selected Time Range\" looks like a bit of an afterthought right now. My guess is this a limitation of the tool you're using to mock this up in. It would be worth thinking about the hierarchy of information here. Rank it and order it as such. I would probably place the selected time range first. I think this is a great add all around.\r\n4. Week Start Day under Defaults > Week/Month is a bit hidden and unless I'm mistaken should probably be closer to the Today, Day, Week, Month selector.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/497106528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/497112635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7615#issuecomment-497112635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7615","id":497112635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzExMjYzNQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T21:17:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T21:17:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7615](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/fc3b043462cf00e8415e8ece22f4d01b131b9cd7?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `37.5%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7615      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   65.24%   65.23%   -0.02%     \n==========================================\n  Files         435      435              \n  Lines       21503    21508       +5     \n  Branches     2379     2377       -2     \n==========================================\n+ Hits        14030    14031       +1     \n- Misses       7353     7357       +4     \n  Partials      120      120\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [...uperset/assets/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor.jsx](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvYXNzZXRzL3NyYy9TcWxMYWIvY29tcG9uZW50cy9TcWxFZGl0b3IuanN4) | `54.76% <37.5%> (-1.44%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7615?src=pr&el=footer).
