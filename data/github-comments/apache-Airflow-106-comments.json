But you can go manually in the jenkins interface and abort the job and that will make the airflow task to fail.\r\n\r\nEdit : After a quick search https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21021905/how-to-stop-a-build-in-jenkins-via-the-rest-api to stop a job through API, I don't think it's already exposed in the library but it's possible to send the request at least.

The Docker operator seems special in that you can use it just fine without a hook. Moving the operator to `contrib/` looks like a breaking change for anyone who's built something on top. Having said that, if nobody objects, I'd leave the operator where it is and add the hook in `contrib/`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/333925552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/333929545","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2628#issuecomment-333929545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2628","id":333929545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzkyOTU0NQ==","user":{"login":"moe-nadal-ck","id":28959205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28959205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck","html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-03T18:06:47Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T18:06:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My bad, I didn't realize the docker operator was already available in the codebase, and in this case, moving it will definitely be a breaking change. \r\nHaving the hook is more a way to factorize all docker related operations at one place (in the case you have sensors, different operators, etc...). \r\nI would go to have the operator and the hook in the same code area (so not putting the hook in contrib) to ease file navigation, but I'm just a newbie here so I'll let more experimented contributor answer this point :).
