from Mu Li:**\r\n\r\nHi Cliff,\r\n \r\nThank you for your summary. We thought to fix it before. One solution is using C++11 execption_ptr (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception_ptr) to pass all exceptions to the main thread, so that we can catch all of them at the python frontend. \r\n \r\nThis feature is not on our team roadmap now, it will be great if you can work on it.\r\n \r\nThanks\r\nMu\r\n\r\n**Comments from Junyuan Xie:**\r\n\r\nOne problem with this is that once an operator fails inside engine it will never be complete and all subsequent operations will hang.\r\n \r\nIt’s unclear how one should recover from this.\r\n \r\n**Comments from Junru Shao:**\r\n\r\nWill it be a good try to\r\nprint out related operands to some log file\r\npass the exception to main thread\r\nkill the operators depending on the operator that throws the exception?\r\n

I understand well, your need is similar to a one-to-one RNN structure in which the first 50 outputs are ignored. \r\n\r\nIf you're not already using it, I think it would be worth looking at the `mx.symbol.RNN` which provides a convenient abstraction for working with of recurrent structure. In short, it takes as input a data of dims batch_size x sequence_length and its output is of dims hidden_features x batch_size x sequence_length. For your need, you could slice that output to remove the first 50 elements of the sequence_length dimension and then proceed to the decoding and application of the output layer as usual. \r\n\r\nNot sure if the model might crash because some elements of the RNN outputs end nowhere because of the slicing. If it's the case, it could do a dummy trick such as multiplying by 0 these first 50 outputs and merge back to the rest for decoding. \r\n\r\nI don't have code that do exactly that, but I'm currently looking to bring that RNN structure into the general R API, you can take a look at the WIP here so see how to deal with `mx.symbol.RNN`: https://github.com/jeremiedb/mxnet_R_bucketing/blob/master/blog/Blog_LSTM_NLP_Classification.Rmd","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/320822751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
