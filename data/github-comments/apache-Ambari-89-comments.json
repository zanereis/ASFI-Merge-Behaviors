issue with all the other component that added to a kerberized cluster,\r\nonce a component  added to  kerberized cluster, service check will failed due to hadoop proxy user not refreshed.\r\n\r\nAlthough you have refreshed the configuration in hive service, the Ambari web still prompts to restart HDFS. Therefore, to completely resolve this issue, we need to work together on the frontend and backend.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can raise this issue on the dev mailing list and create a few tasks to address it:\r\n\r\n1.The frontend should check if the current configuration includes a \"refresh\" command, and if the backend refreshes successfully, the frontend should no longer prompt to restart the HDFS cluster.\r\nIf no HDFS components exist on the nodes where Hive is deployed, kinit will not be able to find the keytab and will report an error. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the HDFS service to perform the refresh command.\r\n2.In the HDFS frontend menu, there is a \"refresh configuration\" button. Once a new component is added, and only when the configuration for that proxy user changes, that interface can be automatically called to perform the refresh.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1501296760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1501298476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3679#issuecomment-1501298476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3679","id":1501298476,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c5Ze_8s","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-10T02:02:24Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T02:02:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@virajjasani

@vishalsuvagia \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25929\r\n\r\nAdding support for Ranger in Ambari is a rather complicated change. It involves packaging Ranger in Apache Bigtop, integration of Ambari Ranger service itself, integration with Ambari Infra, and fixing bugs in Ambari Advisor, since installing Ambari Ranger requires Advisor to provide a lot of recommended configurations. Therefore, I have organized all related pull requests (PRs), and the progress of these PRs can be found in the description of this issue.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all Ranger-related PRs on the Bigtop side have been reviewed and merged. As for the three bugs in Apache Ranger, they have been patched and placed in the resource package of Bigtop because there is currently no one reviewing them in the Apache Ranger community. Therefore, only the Ambari-related PRs need to be reviewed for Ranger support.\r\n\r\nThus, to support Ranger, we need to review and merge the Advisor-related PRs and the PRs for Ambari Infra integration first, and then review the PR for Ranger support. During my testing, I have locally reviewed and merged all the PRs mentioned in the issue description and conducted rigorous testing, and so far, no issues have been found.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1562156984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/1562324366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3697#issuecomment-1562324366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3697","id":1562324366,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c5dHy2O","user":{"login":"virajjasani","id":34790606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzkwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani","html_url":"https://github.com/virajjasani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-25T06:03:58Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T06:03:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JiaLiangC thank you for your efforts!
