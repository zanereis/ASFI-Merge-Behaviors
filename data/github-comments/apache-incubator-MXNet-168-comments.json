That helped me narrow things down. Last night I got it working on both operating systems. \r\n\r\nIn case anyone has a similar problem in the future:\r\nI had installed MXNet prior to RMSProp moving to NNVM. I used `git pull && update && make clean && make -j$(nproc)` to recompile the C++ interface after the new updates were introduced, and then updated the python interface. This is around the time that the NaNs started appearing, so I'm guessing there was a mismatch between the Python & C++ interface. Since it wasn't reproducible I decided to completely uninstall & reinstall everything from scratch (on both the Python and C++ side).
