Using `WordCloud` as an example.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWordCloud\r\n  |--buildQuery.js\r\n  |--transformProps.js\r\n  |--transformData.js\r\n  |--metadata.js\r\n  |\r\n  // for the vanilla js / d3 components\r\n  |--WordCloud.js \r\n  |--ReactWordCloud.jsx // convert WordCloud.js to react component\r\n  // for the React components\r\n  |--WordCloud.jsx\r\n  |\r\n  // Use temporarily until the plugin system is fully implemented\r\n  |--adaptor.jsx\r\n  // This will replace adaptor.jsx once the plugin system is fully implemented\r\n  |--plugin.js\r\n  |\r\n  // TBD: Control configuration \r\n  |--controlConfig.js\r\n  |\r\n  // TBD: This could be class for input/output of the transformProps function\r\n  |--formDataSchema // \r\n  |--dataSchema // \r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is in each file? \r\n\r\n### 1. buildQuery.js\r\n```js\r\nexport default function buildQuery(formData) {\r\n  return queryObject;\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. transformProps.js\r\n```js\r\nexport default function transformProps({ \r\n  slice, \r\n  payload, \r\n  setControlValue,\r\n}) {\r\n  // Return props that are compatible with <WordCloud />\r\n  // In the future can enforce type for the returned object if we use TypeScript. \r\n  return props; \r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote: In the future, will replace `slice` with specific fields, such as `width`, `height`, or `formData` and perhaps add type (if we use typescript) for `formData`\r\n\r\n### 3. transformData.js\r\nTransform props that are based on `payload`. The logic formerly in `get_data` will be moved here.\r\nFor the first version, it will be called from `transformProps.js`, but separated into another function can be useful for future optimization.\r\n```js\r\nexport default function transformData({ payload, formData }) {\r\n  return props;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. metadata.js\r\nDescription of this chart\r\n```js\r\nimport thumbnail from './WordCloud.png';\r\n\r\nexport default new ChartMetadata({\r\n  key: 'word-cloud',\r\n  name: 'WordCloud',\r\n  description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet',\r\n  thumbnail,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.1 WordCloud.js and ReactWordCloud.jsx\r\n\r\nFor vanilla components that are not React yet, we have been refactoring to make it convertible\r\n\r\n#### WordCloud.js\r\n```js\r\nexport default function(element, props) { ... }\r\n```\r\n#### ReactWordCloud.jsx\r\n```js\r\nimport reactify from '../../utils/reactify';\r\nexport default reactify(WordCloud);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.2 WordCloud.jsx\r\n\r\nFor components that are already React component\r\n```js\r\nclass WordCloud extends React.Component {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\nexport default WordCloud;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6. adaptor.jsx\r\nShim to make it work with current Superset app. **This file will be deleted** after we completely move to the plugin system. \r\n```js\r\nimport createAdaptor from '../../utils/createAdaptor';\r\nimport WordCloud from './ReactWordCloud';\r\nimport transformProps from './transformProps';\r\n\r\n// return function(slice, payload, setControlValue) that render the component\r\nexport default createAdaptor(WordCloud, transformProps);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 7. plugin.js\r\nThis is how a chart plugin is defined. It will replace `adaptor.jsx`.\r\n```js\r\nimport buildQuery from './buildQuery';\r\nimport transformProps from './transformProps';\r\nimport metadata from './metadata';\r\nimport WordCloud from './ReactWordCloud';\r\nexport default new ChartPlugin({\r\n  key: 'word-cloud',\r\n  metadata,\r\n  buildQuery,\r\n  transformProps,\r\n  Chart: WordCloud,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins are installed like this\r\n```js\r\nimport wordCloudPlugin from './WordCloud/plugin';\r\nwordCloudPlugin.install();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can use\r\n```js\r\n<SupersetDataProvider type=\"word-cloud\" formData={...}>\r\n  <SuperChart type=\"word-cloud\" xxx={...} />\r\n</SupersetDataProvider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing work for plugin system in #5882 which explains what happens behind-the-scene in `.install()`. Please see the PR for more details. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n@conglei \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/421175040/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/421200414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5692#issuecomment-421200414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5692","id":421200414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTIwMDQxNA==","user":{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-14T01:18:45Z","updated_at":"2018-09-14T01:18:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Until the plugin mechanism is implement, we will be converting the existing chart to conform with the structure above.

User started from add more and more metrics and filters. When user hit run query, server-side return 400 error. so all ajax calls like run query, save slice, shorten link etc, all stop working. \r\nFrom my observation, `adhoc filter` increased payload a lot. But it doesn't reached chrome's limitation. When we call pushState to browser's history, the state will be sent as `Referer` header in the post request. For airbnb actually its nginx/haprox has hard limitation on header size. we increase the limit from 8k to 16k and now we don't have this issue any more. You can check your header size.\r\nI was thinking to remove this payload from header when airbnb first hit this issue. But\r\n- i think you like `stateful url` :) maybe your url is shorter so that you can always refresh the page.\r\n- if removed payload from history object, user can't use back/forward button to undo and redo.\r\n\r\nI am ok to disable pushState by now (i am not sure your solution will work?). for long term I think explore view can use `redux-undo`, like Dashboard remember user editing history.

The problem here is \"a broken build\", which really in most cases the broken build is really just a lint issue related to a bad merge. Maybe the solution is that we should not break the build on lint errors, and instead warn on the PR, and have a policy (either hard or softly enforced) to not merge PRs with lint. \r\n\r\nThis way, when lint shows up as a byproduct or a merge, it wouldn't break the build, it would just generate a tiny bit of lint for anyone who rebases while in this state, and those who do would fix that one-liner. That would prevent the false-negative \"broken build\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422570752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/422571834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5918#issuecomment-422571834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5918","id":422571834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjU3MTgzNA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T22:00:57Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T22:00:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@john-bodley
