The main thing we need to take care is the output shape.\r\n\r\nOk for now I went an easy route of just defining concat_last op. It seems to work, but I'm getting the following typing error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  %101 = @map(tensor_constructor_float32_?_2_4(Tensor[(?, 2, 4), float32]), %100);\r\n  %102 = @tensor_array_concat_last_float32_?_2_?(%101) unable to unify: `static_tensor_float32_?_2_4_t` and `static_tensor_float32_?_2_?_t`; ;\r\n  %103 = @tensor_get_data_float32_?_2_?(%102);\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first axis is already Any by tensor array stack. Now I'm trying to concat (?, 2, 4) tensors along -1 axis to get (?, 2, ?) tensor. Is this possible?

Is torchscript list immutable or mutable like python's list?\r\n\r\nYes it is mutable. List `append` is mapped to `aten::append` in Torchscript and it is entirely side-effecting operation. See below for a simple module that only does list append and its Torchscript representation.\r\n\r\n Even though variables that are updated in the loop are supposed to be passed to `prim::Loop` op to become loop variables, this does not apply to side effecting operations like list append. Translating this module to Relay is complicated because also in Relay loop variables are the only ones that can be updated between iteration. If we naively translate it, the list `outputs.1` below appears free in the loop and can not be updated.\r\n\r\n```Py\r\nclass ListAppend(nn.Module):\r\n    def forward(self, input):\r\n        # type: (Tensor) -> List[Tensor]\r\n        outputs = []\r\n        for i in range(input.size(0)):\r\n            outputs.append(input)\r\n        return outputs\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ngraph(%self : __torch__.ListAppend,\r\n      %input.1 : Tensor):\r\n  %8 : bool = prim::Constant[value=1]() # rnn_test.py:142:8\r\n  %4 : int = prim::Constant[value=0]() # rnn_test.py:142:34\r\n  %outputs.1 : Tensor[] = prim::ListConstruct()\r\n  %5 : int = aten::size(%input.1, %4) # rnn_test.py:142:23\r\n   = prim::Loop(%5, %8) # rnn_test.py:142:8\r\n    block0(%i : int):\r\n      %12 : Tensor[] = aten::append(%outputs.1, %input.1) # rnn_test.py:143:12\r\n      -> (%8)\r\n  return (%outputs.1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo workaround the difficulty of list append, I use list concat to append one element at the tail of a list. The original LSTM models in Pytorch repo do not use list append either and use concat instead, probably for the same reason.

I wonder if we can also discuss the alternative abstractions. Right now the abstraction seems to suggest that conceptually the size of the warp is reduced to half(as the shuffle size). However, another way to view it would be to keep the size of the warp to be fixed(32), but support the index access pattern of the subgroups, for example, the canonical form below describes a shuffle in the group of 4\r\n> \r\n> ```c++\r\n> A[wi] = B[(wi/4)*4+ ((wi % 4) +1) %4]\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIn the alternative approach, `__shfl(x, (threadIdx.x + 1) % 4, 4)` becomes `__shfl(x, threadIdx.y * 4 + (threadIdx.x + 1) % 4)` (and `threadIdx.z` might also be involved). Is my understanding right?\r\n\r\nI think the good thing is better compatibility for OpenCL. By this approach, we can support OpenCL using the old 2-parameter intrinsic.\r\n\r\nAnd I think the bad thing comes with CUDA's new shuffle API. `__shfl` has actually been [deprecated](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#warp-shuffle-functions) by CUDA, and we will have to switch to the new `__shfl_sync` API. The new API requires an explicit argument `mask` to specify which threads are active during this shuffle. In the approach of this PR, we will only need to calculate the activeness within a partial (say 1/2, 1/4, etc) warp, which can be calculated from the `if` nest, given the thread indices of the current partial warp. But in the alternative approach, we will need to calculate the activeness within a whole warp, which means other threads outside the current partial warp will be involved. It may bring a lot of complexity, and even run time overhead when there are dynamic conditions.\r\n\r\nTo better support both CUDA and OpenCL, maybe we can use both of the approaches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/612545516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/612547407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5310#issuecomment-612547407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5310","id":612547407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjU0NzQwNw==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-12T01:20:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T01:37:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@masahi Yeah, I only have some hypothetic explanations which motivated me to make this change. I think the reason why heap was slow was because we generated a huge amount of stmts for array initialization. It makes the code size so huge even though many of them are simple. But each optimization and codegen on it would be still very slow (particularly they are pointers). However, after we move the array to the data segment, we can remove these stmts but only have one pointer. Therefore, the compilation should be much faster. In the latter case, linking and data loading would take more time, but it is still insignificant compared to compilation.
