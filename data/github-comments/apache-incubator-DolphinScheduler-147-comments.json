After generating a task instance, the task instance is in the initial state first. At this time, the pre dependency of the task is checked regularly. If it is completed, the task state is changed to ready and queued into the executable queue. Use a separate service to check dependencies, not as a task!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/951626828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/951671505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6605#issuecomment-951671505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6605","id":951671505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms44uVrR","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T08:10:16Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T08:10:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"### Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\n### operate\r\nwhen I run a shell for   testing mapreduce in ds  (fee image below)，ds web log shows : yarn status get failed.\r\nshell content :\r\n`hadoop jar /opt/app/hadoop-2.9.2/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.9.2.jar pi 10 10`\r\n![360截图17520712172535](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20452924/138829616-ce15ed7b-6ad1-46b3-be4d-c45025294689.png)\r\n### ds web log\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.745  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[115] - create dir success /exec/process/1/1/6/89\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.754  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[88] - shell task params {\"rawScript\":\"hadoop jar /opt/app/hadoop-2.9.2/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.9.2.jar pi 10 10\",\"localParams\":[],\"resourceList\":[]}\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.758  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[154] - raw script : hadoop jar /opt/app/hadoop-2.9.2/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.9.2.jar pi 10 10\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.759  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[155] - task execute path : /exec/process/1/1/6/89\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.760  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[87] - tenantCode user:root, task dir:1_6_89\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.760  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[92] - create command file:/exec/process/1/1/6/89/1_6_89.command\r\n[INFO] 2021-10-26 10:34:28.760  - [taskAppId=TASK-1-6-89]:[111] - command : #!/bin/sh\r\nBASEDIR=$(cd `dirname $0`;
