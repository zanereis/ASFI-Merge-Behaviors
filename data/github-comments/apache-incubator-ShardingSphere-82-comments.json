Here are my designs for the information_schema queries:\r\n\r\n**Design one:** Fake the responses of queries about information_schema. We can intercept such sqls and fake the responses.\r\n\r\n**Design two:** Use default datanode. Create the logic tables in the default datanode, and route these sqls to default datanode for querying.\r\nFor example, following is the logic table t_order structure:\r\n```\r\nt_order:\r\n          |____demo_ds_0:\r\n          |          |_____t_order_0\r\n          |          |_____t_order_1\r\n          |___demo_ds_1:\r\n                     |_____t_order_0\r\n                     |_____t_order_1\r\n```\r\nWe can create empty table with the same name as t_order in the default datanode like demo_ds_0.t_order for information_schema query.Also, this table can be used for getting

@tristaZero Here are my designs for the information_schema queries:\r\n> \r\n> **Design one:** Fake the responses of queries about information_schema. We can intercept such sqls and fake the responses.\r\n> \r\n> **Design two:** Use default datanode. Create the logic tables in the default datanode, and route these sqls to default datanode for querying.\r\n> For example, following is the logic table t_order structure:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> t_order:\r\n>           |____demo_ds_0:\r\n>           |          |_____t_order_0\r\n>           |          |_____t_order_1\r\n>           |___demo_ds_1:\r\n>                      |_____t_order_0\r\n>                      |_____t_order_1\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> We can create empty table with the same name as t_order in the default datanode like demo_ds_0.t_order for information_schema query.Also, this table can be used for getting metadata.\r\n\r\nI understand this design need user create a table `t_order`  only for query information_schema.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is a good idea. User must maintain it's structure keep up with `t_order_0`.\r\n\r\nParse query sql and rewrite the sql is a good idea?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/557515811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/557632821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/3580#issuecomment-557632821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3580","id":557632821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzYzMjgyMQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T18:03:22Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T18:03:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
