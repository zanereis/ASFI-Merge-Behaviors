you can not specify a <dependency> on \"beam-runners-spark with -Pspark1\"_\r\n\r\n_And if I build my own pom.xml with -Pspark1, it will have no effect at all, or it will fail, because my pom.xml won't have a profile named \"spark1\"_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337676517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337681824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3999#issuecomment-337681824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3999","id":337681824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzY4MTgyNA==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T18:17:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T18:17:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ping?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337681824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337683207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3677#issuecomment-337683207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3677","id":337683207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzY4MzIwNw==","user":{"login":"bschell","id":8600774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8600774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell","html_url":"https://github.com/bschell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T18:22:27Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T18:22:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Added license headers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337683207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337684082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3677#issuecomment-337684082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3677","id":337684082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzY4NDA4Mg==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T18:25:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T18:25:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks!

So this is mostly a total rewrite so I rebased anyhow; please take a fresh look.\r\n\r\n - The pipeline being \"staged\" is actually the `DataflowRunner` talking to the runner harness, so it isn't really part of the other staging logic that is the SDK/user pipeline talking to the SDK harness. The staging location just happens to be a convenient place where we know the client can write and the runner harness can read. So I went back to using the raw `stage_file` method but I am happy to use more appropriate helper logic if it exists.\r\n - The setting of the metadata `\"pipeline_url\"` to this proto is the common piece across SDKs. Everyone needs to put it somewhere accessible to the runner harness, but the SDK can choose where and set this field to anything. Is it a mandatory part of every job from now on.\r\n - It looks like the `stage_file` method returns nothing if staged to a local file or the full GCS `Object` (this is the `response`) if it is GCS. Normally, I would set the metadata field to maybe a URL returned by `stage_file` but I didn't want to mess with that. So the URL is hardcoded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337987136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/337987418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4010#issuecomment-337987418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4010","id":337987418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzk4NzQxOA==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T17:57:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T17:57:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Incidentally, my formatting may or may not matter to you.
