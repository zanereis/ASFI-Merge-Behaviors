one more high-level comment that needs to be resolved before continuing.\nI think representing every database row by a JdbcDataRecord will be inefficient, since every such object requires allocating 4 arrays, boxing the primitive-type columns into the Object[] array, etc. My experience with pumping a lot of data from/to a database says that these overheads can easily become a serious bottleneck.\n\nI would recommend a slightly different approach that, e.g., Spring JDBC uses (RowMapper and BatchPreparedStatementSetter, see http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html): make this source and sink generic and let the user provide callbacks for extracting their type from a ResultSet/ResultSetMetadata, and for filling in a PreparedStatement from their type. I don't mean necessarily use Spring JDBC's classes directly (I don't know if we can or want to have that as a dependency, though if the answer was \"yes\" then it'd be nice)\n\nAdditionally, in the sink:\n- for efficiency it'd be great to introduce batching.\n- for both efficiency and generality, it'd be better to let the user supply a parameterized SQL string, rather than hand-assemble the string in the processElement call. It might be e.g. that the user wants to update() things rather than insert, or that they want to use a custom SQL dialect supported by their database of choice.\n\nI'll also make a pass now over the code and comment on things that will likely stay relevant after such a refactoring.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/246434275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/246442720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/942#issuecomment-246442720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/942","id":246442720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjQ0MjcyMA==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T18:23:25Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T18:23:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for your comments.

check issues with Jenkins seems to be a Jenkins issue and one of the 5 Travis builds just timed out so that also doesn't look like a code related issue.\n\nAnyway, I think I have all the comments taken into account now and the new travis build/check with eclipse-jdt seems to have passed.  Anything left?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/247111190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/247123945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/958#issuecomment-247123945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/958","id":247123945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzEyMzk0NQ==","user":{"login":"charlesccychen","id":1055135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1055135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesccychen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T19:17:51Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T19:17:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R: @mdvorsky\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/247123945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/247135516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/949#issuecomment-247135516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/949","id":247135516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzEzNTUxNg==","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T20:01:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T20:01:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A couple more comments, but otherwise looks good.

The benefit we gain here from reshuffling is that we are able to reduce the read latency that comes from oversharding for a large collection of small elements [i.e. gcs paths](through prefetching and skipping empty shards).  But for a large collection of moderately sized elements, perhaps it's the case that this overhead is negligible and most of the time is spent actually reading the elements.  I don't have any numbers, but I could see adding an extra shuffle step here in this case to be somewhat costly because it bottlenecks on one worker.
