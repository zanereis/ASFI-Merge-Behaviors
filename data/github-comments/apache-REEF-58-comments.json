I should have be more specific for what I'd like to point out: I agree that it's great to support as many versions as possible. Also, the maintenance cost is tiny as you mentioned.\nHowever, the guide (README.md) will have a long list if we keep all the supported versions. We can avoid this just by showing in a different way (e.g., adding \"Supported versions\" column and having \"0.24-0.27\" in Mesos row)\nThis is a minor improvement and can be handled in a separate PR though. I think we can merge this PR as it is for now :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/186793630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/186796111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/820#issuecomment-186796111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/820","id":186796111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Njc5NjExMQ==","user":{"login":"yunseong","id":1748276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1748276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong","html_url":"https://github.com/yunseong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunseong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-21T10:44:59Z","updated_at":"2016-02-21T10:44:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The tests passed on Mesos 0.26, but unfortunately, failed on Mesos0.27.
