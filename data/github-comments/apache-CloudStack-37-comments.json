My first commit was not performed properly. Sadly, the eclipse ended up formatting classes I touched, and that is why the line number added was higher than the removed one.\n\nI do understand that “s_ something“ is a proper way to instantiate a static variable in ACS classes. However, in few of the subclasses of “com.cloud.utils.component.ComponentLifecycleBase” it was used names such as “LOGGER” (that is a proper name for static field as JAVA standards), log, status_logger and others.\n\nWhat we propose is to change the logger variable in “com.cloud.utils.component.ComponentLifecycleBase” to protected and remove its static and final declaration. Therefore we did the following in ComponentLifecycleBase:\nprotected Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(getClass());\nThis way, every single subclass of ComponentLifecycleBase, when instantiated would automatically have a logger instance for its proper class ready to be used.\n\nI have edited the commit, what do you think of it now?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/132654938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/132662044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/714#issuecomment-132662044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/714","id":132662044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjY2MjA0NA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-19T16:08:34Z","updated_at":"2015-08-19T16:08:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pedro-martins your motivation makes sense to me, can you create a jira ticket and c&p it there? then use that as a tag for any commits (including cleanup/autoformat).\n\nOne concern remaining is (not knowing the entire hierarchy by head) whether instance level loggers will be any kind of overhead.

PR is a great example of how to do code refactoring. Write unit tests that exercise the semantics, change the logic around it, run the unit tests again to show the semantics is the same.\nGreat work.\n\nHowever, @anshul1886 has a point related to the tests being coupled to the implementation via the path string. IMHO that is not a result of having the tests, that is a result of having the path string hardcoded in the class. That was there already and @rafaelweingartner worked with that to make the rest better.\n\nI would merge this now, because it is good work, and later (new PR) refactor the class XcpOssResource (and respective test) to make it parametric on the path string. While putting this specific string in a constants class, or in a config attribute (maybe in the DB, not sure about that), to make it easier to change and reuse.\n\nEdit: give credits to the committer (not sure if @cristofolini was also involved in this, but if that is the case credits to him too :smile:)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/132949485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/132957093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/700#issuecomment-132957093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/700","id":132957093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjk1NzA5Mw==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-20T09:42:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-20T09:42:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks all for your efforts, I'm merging this now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/132957093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/132962997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/721#issuecomment-132962997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/721","id":132962997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjk2Mjk5Nw==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-20T10:04:01Z","updated_at":"2015-08-20T10:04:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM here as well.
