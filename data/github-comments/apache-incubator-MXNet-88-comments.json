example and the code implementation in kvstore_dist_server.h,\nI find when use kvstore_server, the updater mush be set by call set_optimizer in the worker node, before call kvstore push.\nwhen just use local version kvstore, the updater can be default as the \"Assign\" operation, which is consistent with the doc.\nI have a question why there can't be default assignment behavior in kvstore server?\nfor example, the code in \n\n```\nvoid DataHandle(const ps::KVMeta& req_meta,\n                  const ps::KVPairs<real_t>& req_data,\n                  ps::KVServer<real_t>* server) {\n```\n\ncan such code\n\n```\n // async push\n        exec_.Exec([this, key, &recved, &stored](){\n          CHECK(updater_);\n          updater_(key, recved, &stored);\n        });\n        server->Response(req_meta);\n        stored.WaitToRead();\n```\n\nbe modified to\n\n```\n // async push\n        if(updater_ != nullptr){\n          exec_.Exec([this, key, &recved, &stored](){\n            CHECK(updater_);\n            updater_(key, recved, &stored);\n          });\n        } else {\n          CopyFromTo(recved, &stored, 0);\n        }\n        server->Response(req_meta);\n        stored.WaitToRead();\n```\n\n?\nand sorry, another question, after try them all, I guess kvstore is not design as I read from its name, a key-value storage and support distribution.\ndirectly use it to share value in different process is not easy (finaly, i only achieved in the 'dist-async' mode, the 'dist-sync' mode will blocking when call push).\nmaybe It try to do some automatic work for parameter-server.\nand, If I want use serveral workers for training and one worker just pull param only for prediction. is there any convenient way by using kvstore? or I should do the communication by myself like use multiprocessing?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/230295298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/230315427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2612#issuecomment-230315427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2612","id":230315427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDMxNTQyNw==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-04T15:35:28Z","updated_at":"2016-07-04T15:35:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen
