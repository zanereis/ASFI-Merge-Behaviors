Now in your design approach you can assume that the file containing the permissions for all notebooks would be stored in a folder that can be accessed only by an administrator (essentially the same person who has the permission to start/stop the zeppelin process). That approach is fine too and you don't need encryption in that case. However, key point is you need to have note permission stored in a separate file not in the actual notebook data. In either approach this is the prerequisite.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nSourav\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/183949562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/183951948","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/681#issuecomment-183951948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/681","id":183951948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mzk1MTk0OA==","user":{"login":"sourav-mazumder","id":14955207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU1MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14955207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder","html_url":"https://github.com/sourav-mazumder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T19:03:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T19:03:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Hayssams,\n\nI liked your approach.

User should be able to pick and choose. This PR does not need to implement all of those options right now.

I think it make sense to handle as a separate issue. but while we want to minimize incompatibility of notebook format and configuration file format every release, I think ZEPPELIN-666 must be resolved before the next release.\n\nRegarding authorizing interpreter, it is a good idea.\nBut to do that, Zeppelin should provide per user interpreter-binding, as a precondition. Therefore it'll bring much more codebase change and incompatibility of conf/interpreter.json. So, I think it's nice subject to have discussion in a separate issue.\n\nRegarding independent notebook structure per user, \nI think it's conflict with this Authorization implementation. Because this design allows multiple owner, and it's not clear how multiple owner can be handled in 'independent notebook structure per user'.\nAnd this subject is also related to API of NotebookRepo interface, as well as migration of old directory structure.

Thanks!\n\n@hayssams - Your design allows for fine-grained controls and is elegant. I am trying to figure out how I would make it work in my company where we have a homegrown authentication scheme described below. The LDAP server is locked down tight and I am not sure if the security team would allow Zeppelin to write to it.\n\n> If an incoming request to the Zeppelin server does not have a cookie with user information encrypted with the authentication server public key, the user is redirected to the LDAP authentication server. Once the user is verified, the authentication server redirects the browser to a specific URL in the Zeppelin server which sets the authentication cookie in the browser. The end result is that all requests to the Zeppelin web server have the authentication cookie which contains user and groups information.\n\nWe have made the implementation in this pull request work in my company environment by setting   userAndRoles in the NotebookSocket constructor using the information in the authentication cookie.\n\n> Not sure if your implementation currently protect from discovering the notes through the search service.\n\nIt does not. We are mostly concerned with preventing users from viewing results in notes for which they don't have read permissions. We can create a separate issue to prevent users from viewing queries in notes for which they don't have read permissions.\n\n@Leemoonsoo's - I understand your concern regarding notebook portability and agree we should resolve ZEPPELIN-666 before the next release.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/184474829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/184484524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/715#issuecomment-184484524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/715","id":184484524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDQ4NDUyNA==","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-16T02:35:40Z","updated_at":"2016-02-16T02:35:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/184484524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/184497319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/681#issuecomment-184497319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/681","id":184497319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDQ5NzMxOQ==","user":{"login":"sourav-mazumder","id":14955207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU1MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14955207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder","html_url":"https://github.com/sourav-mazumder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-16T03:24:51Z","updated_at":"2016-02-16T03:24:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi
