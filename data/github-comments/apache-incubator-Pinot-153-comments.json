I checked the usage of `StreamConfig.getGroupId()` and I think we already handled the case of missing group id (in `PinotTableIdealStateBuilder.getGroupIdFromRealtimeDataTable()`). @navina In which scenario are we getting the `null` group id?\r\n\r\nI was not aware of the `PinotTableIdealStateBuilder.getGroupIdFromRealtimeDataTable()` usage. But when the kafka consumer client config doesn't contain `group.id`, the kafka consumer created ends up using `null` as group id. Previously, it would default to empty string. This is breaking monitoring tools for existing users. \r\nIdeally, LLC consumer shouldn't care about group id. However, it looks like some users are relying having a non-null `group.id` for the sake of monitoring.

So, the default in the partition level consumer ends-up being empty string and with newer kafka version, it is null. You can set group.id explicitly in KafkaPartitionLevelStreamConfig.java.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am unable to understand the above comment. Is `group.id` will be set similar to what is done [here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9260/files#diff-8a2ae243067a42eca9160d77eafb886e42a9aefe37046259d31d6fe7a31ada6dR101) .

Here are some possible ways in which you can verify that the ingestion is still progressing:\r\n1. Using the Rest APIs via the Swagger UI:\r\na. `/getTableStatus` and verify that the state is `HEALTHY`\r\nb. `/debug/tables/{tableName}` to view the debug information for the table. You can increase the verbosity to see more details.\r\nc. `/consumingSegmentsInfo` -> if this doesn't return any segments, it means there are no consuming segments and ideally, you would have caught this \"error\" state in the previous 2 queries\r\n2. Look at the metrics, if you have them exported somewhere:\r\na. if `LLC_PARTITION_CONSUMING` is non-zero, there is an ingestion issue\r\n3. Look at the ZK status - make sure that the ideal state (IS) and external view (EV) for that table match and each partition has a consuming segment. \r\n4. Search the server logs for any error or exception.\r\n\r\nHappy to connect on the Apache Pinot slack and troubleshoot as well.
