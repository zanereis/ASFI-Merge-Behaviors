This is a developer error and the action will timeout. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223311806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223312909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/484#issuecomment-223312909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/484","id":223312909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzMxMjkwOQ==","user":{"login":"jberstler","id":7012682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTI2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7012682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler","html_url":"https://github.com/jberstler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T14:41:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T14:41:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> it would be better converting from bash to nodejs, using shelljs or cash\n\nI tend to agree.  In the past, I've made bash scripts truly cross-platform by converting them to Node using the shelljs module. It was very easy and straightforward to accomplish, as well as making my scripts more powerful than when they were written in bash.  \n\nBut really... this is probably a discussion for a separate

The beauty of Python is that we do not define the type for any parameters. We can simply name it and use it as the type we like. There can be no key, one key, multiple keys for a dict. We just take it by dict.get('key') or dict['key'] without any declaration.

further.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223480596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223481180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/556#issuecomment-223481180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/556","id":223481180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ4MTE4MA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T03:16:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T03:16:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223481180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223487183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/73#issuecomment-223487183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/73","id":223487183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ4NzE4Mw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T04:18:43Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T04:18:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@domdom82

I will break this over several comments\n\n# 1. Feed Architecture Choices\n\nThere are at least 3 strategies for creating a feed: \"Hooks\", \"Polling\" and \"Connections\".\n\n## Hooks\n\n\"Hooks\" means we set up a feed using a webhook facility from another service.   In this strategy, we configure a webhook on a service to POST directly to a whisk URL to fire a trigger.  This is by far the easiest and most attractive option for implementing low-frequency feeds.\n- The github feed is implemented using webhooks.\n\n## Polling\n\n\"Polling\" means that we arrange a whisk action to poll an endpoint periodically to fetch new data.\nThis is easy to build, but is low performance, and is limited by the polling interval.\n- I have a prototype of a MessageHub feed using polling.\n\n## Connections\n\n\"Connections\"  means that we stand up a separate service somewhere that maintains a persistent connection to a feed source.    The connection based implementation might interact with a service endpoint via long polling, or to set up a push notification.\n- Our cloudant changes feed is connection based.   We are working on a high-performance MessageHub connection-based feed using Kafka consumers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223589233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223592054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/559#issuecomment-223592054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/559","id":223592054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzU5MjA1NA==","user":{"login":"sjfink","id":1533170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink","html_url":"https://github.com/sjfink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T14:21:38Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T14:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"# 2. Difference between Feed and Trigger\n\nSome definitions:\n- Whisk processes **events** which flow into the system.\n- A **trigger** is simply a name for a class of events.   Each event belongs to exactly one trigger.   A good analogy is \"topic\" in pub-sub world.    A Rule T -> A means \"whenever an event from trigger T arrives, invoke action A with the trigger payload.\n- A  **feed** is a stream of events which all belong to some trigger T.

Implementing Feed Actions\n\nThe feed action is a normal OpenWhisk action, but it should accept the following parameters:\n- lifecycleEvent: one of 'CREATE', 'DELETE', 'PAUSE', or 'UNPAUSE'\n- triggerName: the fully-qualified name of the trigger which contains events produced from this feed.\n- authKey: the Basic auth credentials of the OpenWhisk user who owns the trigger just mentioned\n\nThe feed action can also accept any other parameters it needs to manage the feed.  For example the cloudant changes feed action expects to receive parameters including 'dbname', 'username', etc.\n\nWhen the user creates a trigger with the --feed parameter, the system automatically invokes the feed action with the appropriate parameters.\n\nFor example,assume the user has created a `mycloudant` binding for `cloudant` with their username and password as bound parameters.  Then when the user issues:\n\n`wsk trigger create T --feed mycloudant/changes -p dbName myTable`,\n\nthen under the covers the system will do something equivalent to:\n`wsk action invoke mycloudant/changes -p lifecycleEvent CREATE -p triggerName T -p authKey <userAuthKey> -p password <password value from mycloudant binding> -p username <username value from mycloudant binding> -p dbName mytype`\n\nThe feed action takes these parameters, and is expected to take whatever action is necesssary to set up a stream of events from cloudant, with the appropriate configuration, directed to the trigger T.    For cloudant, the action happens to talk directly to a `cloudanttrigger` service we've implemented with a connection-based architecture.   We'll discuss the other architectures below.\n\nA similar feed action protocol occurs for `wsk trigger delete`.

6. Implementing Feeds via Connections\n\nThe previous 2 methods are easy .. but if you want a high-performance feed, there is no substitute for persistent connections and long-polling or similar techniques.\n\nSince OpenWhisk actions are stateless, right now there is no way keep a persistent connection open to a third party.   So instead, we are forced to stand up a separate service (outside of whisk) that runs all the time.   We call these **provider services**.  A provider service can maintain connections to third party event sources that support long polling or other connection-based notifications.   \n\nThe provider service should provide a REST API that allows the whisk feed action to control the feed.   The provider service acts as a proxy between the event provider and whisk -- when it receives events from the third party, it sends them on to whisk by firing a trigger.\n\nThe cloudant built-in feed is the canonical example -- it stands up a cloudanttrigger service which mediates between cloudant notifications over a persistent connection, and whisk triggers.\n\nThe alarm feed is implemented with a similar pattern.\n\nWe will soon provide a MessageHub feed with a similar pattern.\n\nFor the moment, these provider services must POST events to whisk in order to fire triggers.  Eventually, we will hook up MessageHub events directly into whisk to avoid the POST overhead.   \n\nThe connection-based architecture is the highest performance option -- but it's far more difficult to operate and maintain than the polling and hook architectures.   The provider service must be production-quality: it must be highly-available and fault-tolerant.    Our current providers do not meet this requirement, and will need work to reach production quality standards.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223606222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/223606614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/559#issuecomment-223606614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/559","id":223606614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzYwNjYxNA==","user":{"login":"sjfink","id":1533170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink","html_url":"https://github.com/sjfink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T15:13:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T15:13:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"# 7.
