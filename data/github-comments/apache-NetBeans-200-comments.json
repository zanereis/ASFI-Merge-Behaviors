I already have one CSS hint/suggestion on another branch, just to test smth but without any test.\r\n\r\n* The best implementation that I found is the PHP stuff for suggestions, but the problem is that I get a timeout when I try to run a PHP related suggestion test like this one locally: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/php/php.editor/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/modules/php/editor/verification/InitializeFieldsSuggestionTest.java and on my branch, on the pipeline, the tests are not executed/skipped, but maybe because of the failing latte tests.\r\n\r\n* I also had a look into JsHintsProvider and JsHints. There is just one fix, changing the EcmaLevel but everything seems a warning. The tests will not work with suggestions. There will be a Parse exception, when I change the severity warning to a current_line_waning. Ok I really don't know whether I need to change smth else.\r\n\r\nFazit: It seems PHP and maybe JS are better implemented in their *HintsProvider and I need to change the whole logik of the HtmlHintsProvider but JS also lacks of tests and suggestions are also not a big player for JS (not yet). Should this be part of this ticket? I guess not.\r\n\r\nI also think that we should make this somehow consistent for all CSL languages as good as possible. PHP uses Classes for like SuggestionRule, HintRule and ErrorRule, which just set the severity to the correct one and so on. ~~So probably I will create another PR with the \"fx\" of the HtmlHintsProvider with using Tests~~. I will ake the refactoring in this PR because I already have a Suggestion here.\r\n\r\nI think I ran into a rabbithole and yes, it is not your business but the code is a big mess and I want to rework it and hope to not break more than before.

@febilus, you did good since I see only one commit in your branch - so the squashing worked.\r\n\r\nthe branch is a few weeks old but I think this shouldn't matter here since the Wildfly area has low traffic.\r\n\r\nin future: lets say the PR is reviewed and someone asks you to squash the PR to make it ready to integration you can do the following:\r\nyou could update your branch (rewrite history) and put your commits on top of latest changes **without a merge commit**, all you have to do is:\r\n```\r\ngit pull --rebase git@github.com:apache/netbeans master\r\n```\r\n(this assumes you have the PR branch checked out)\r\n(you can also use origin alias if it points at the apache repo)\r\n(this will also get rid of any existing merge commits, if there are any)\r\n\r\nNow its easy to squash the commits however you like them to be (in most cases it will be just one commit).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind other projects might have a different policy, some don't allow force pushes and let the person who integrates the PR squash it etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1962335042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1962337645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7055#issuecomment-1962337645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7055","id":1962337645,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M509uVt","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-24T11:49:08Z","updated_at":"2024-02-24T11:49:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"tests
