When worker failover, in the function of `killYarnJob`, the logic is send a view log request to worker and then parse it. However, worker is just the client to submit yarn job, the worker failover will not auto-kill submitted yarn jobs, so in the situation that worker is failover and how can it response the log info?\r\n> \r\n> Feel sorry that i don't have the production environment, so I'm not sure whether it's a bug or i understand it wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is a history issue, in the before, there exist a LogServer deploy at the worker's machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1211867162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1211870492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11262#issuecomment-1211870492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11262","id":1211870492,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5IO60c","user":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T11:35:43Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T11:35:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > already\r\n> \r\n> > > @ruanwenjun Yeh, maybe a practicable solution, we can simply talk about it.\r\n> > > Before submitting a yarn job, the client apply the application context from RM first, and get appId which will be then written into NM's environment variable. We can use java agent to read it before executing yarn job's JAR file, also, can take taskInstanceId as input of agent program. However, where to store this mapping relationship need to be further considered.\r\n> > > Please let me know if you have any good suggestions!\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > In fact, there is already a issue(#4025) talk about use agent to collect the appId, but I think it isn't a good way üò¢ , we need to maintain a agent and we may need to maintain different version agant.\r\n> \r\n> I think there's no need to maintain different version agent, for example, we can parse the appId from some environment variables such as `APPLICATION_WEB_PROXY_BASE`. All yarn jobs' `AM` maintain this environment variable, i've already verified it in Flink, Spark, Hive, MR, Spark-SQL. The only difference is how to set java options which can be defined in each type of task.\r\n> \r\n> So, it seems like yarn jobs submitted by shell command can all get appId in this way. Anyway, there are some other design problems, like where to store the mapping relationship, as mentioned in issue([#4025](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4025)). I'll carefully think about that.\r\n\r\nYou need to make sure the agent can work for all yarn

You need to make sure the agent can work for all yarn client.\r\n\r\n@ruanwenjun  I think most of yarn clients can share the same agent, cuz in these clients, AOP will intercept func `submitApplication`, except for submitting yarn job with JDBC connection, like `beeline`(hive server2, as mentioned in issue(https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4025)), however, beeline may create an external JDBC connection, we can not kill an external yarn job, right? So, if we don't consider these special situations, we can use the same agent for all other yarn
