design requires updating rocketmq-client, which might bring cost for users to update rocketmq-client. I've some suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. `accessKey` should be defined as a globally unique string, so that complexity is reduced and users with older versions of rocketmq-client may adopt this feature. \r\nSome uniqueness check of `accessKey` should be added in ACL mqadmin command to keep `accessKey` globally unique with best effort.\r\n\r\n2. One `accessKey` can only be granted permissions to access resources in the same namespace.\r\n\r\n3. Separate presentation with storage of namespace in ACL module. `{namespace}%{resource}` is just a presentation way of resources in a namespace. For the definition of `account` data structure, a new field should be added to store namespace. When checking permissions, resources defined in ACL account are converted as `{namespace}%{resource}`.\r\n\r\nIn that way, the ACL config file would like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nglobalWhiteRemoteAddresses:\r\n  - 10.10.103.*\r\n  - 192.168.0.*\r\naccounts:\r\n  - accessKey: RocketMQ  # accessKey is globally unique\r\n    secretKey: 12345678\r\n
