I've been thinking about it and I'm still not sure the best option. The point you made in the JIRA about skipping over corrupted transaction markers is a good one, so I feel we're restricted in that case. For parsing errors, it's a bit trickier. One option that we've toyed around with on several occasions is making the parsing lazy (i.e. moving it into `ConsumerRecord`). In that case, the consumer's offset would be advanced when the record is returned and it would only be when the user calls `key()` or `value()` that an exception is raised. This is effectively like skipping over the failed records. The risk there is that the user will now be expected to rewind the offset to avoid having it committed (if that is indeed the behavior they want). \r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like having the consumer skip records internally because it introduces an inconsistency with the behavior of the consumer given its current position (i.e. what I tried to explain before; that the result of a fetch depends not only on the current state, but the previous history). So if we want to let the consumer skip past parsing errors, then I think the lazy parsing would be a better option. However, I'd be a little reluctant to implement this for the current release, so my preference is probably to not do any skipping for now. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/303478525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/303486792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3075#issuecomment-303486792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3075","id":303486792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzQ4Njc5Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-23T18:15:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T18:15:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
