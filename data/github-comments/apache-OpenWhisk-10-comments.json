I think it's exactly the same situation with @eljuanchosf .\n\nI'm sure my local CouchDB runs well. It can be reached both by https://127.0.0.1:6984 and http://127.0.0.1:5984. I tested by \"curl -k https://127.0.0.1:6984\" and \"curl -k http://127.0.0.1:5984\".\nI'm even quite sure the whisk.system is stored in the database. I can query the data by: curl -s -k --user root:ps -X GET https://127.0.0.1:6984/subjects/whisk.system.\n\nI tried to config _https_ and 6984 in couchdb-local.env, it reported the same error as @eljuanchosf reported when \"ant deploy\". Then I tried to config _http_ and 5984 in couchdb-local.env, it reported the same error: The supplied authentication is invalid.\n\nIt's quite interesting because ./tools/db/createImmortalDBs.sh can successfully insert data to CouchDB, but it looks like wsk cannot. I'm quite curious how @eljuanchosf work it around.\n\nDaisy\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/219962314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/219962806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/337#issuecomment-219962806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/337","id":219962806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTk2MjgwNg==","user":{"login":"daisy-ycguo","id":1657701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1657701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo","html_url":"https://github.com/daisy-ycguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daisy-ycguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T08:41:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T08:42:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh.

made some corrections and minor edits. Also tried to clarify, where it might be confusing, what commands run on the host vs Vagrant vm. Lastly, I removed the experimental native Mac instructions because they're not complete and as is, will not work. \n\nFor your review https://github.com/rabbah/openwhisk/commit/fe4e9f845f297da1d22388e6643e224c57a510ee (I will squash as part of the commit to master).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/220887564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/220911117","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/364#issuecomment-220911117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/364","id":220911117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDkxMTExNw==","user":{"login":"lzbj","id":17563447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTYzNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17563447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj","html_url":"https://github.com/lzbj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzbj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-23T07:55:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-23T07:55:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@csantanapr , I updated the catalog.md for this issue and created a pull request.

2 is particularly important as the occasional slowness of consul as well as our data set growing can lead to constant banging on consul which can make things worse.  Since we are refactoring all of this now, we might as well do it.  The original Thread version with inter-iteration sleep prevents this from happening because it would start the next iteration 5 seconds after the prior iteration completes.  The new version will schedule an iteration every 5 seconds regardless of how long a prior iteration took.\n\nSeparately, note that we are hitting consul unnecessarily because the loadbalancer piece of the info is locally available.
