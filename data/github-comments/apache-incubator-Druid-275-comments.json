How I got into referring to this feature as \"resource pools\" is that I was borrowing the name from Vertica. (https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/ResourceManager/ManagingWorkloads.htm?tocpath=Administrator%27s%20Guide%7CManaging%20the%20Database%7CManaging%20Workloads%7C_____0)\r\n\r\nIn Vertica one can define separate resource pools that have attributes like  how much bandwidth they may use etc. A user account can be associated with a resource pool and resource pools can be set up in such a way that a query can start in one resource pool and can be moved to a different resource pool on certain conditions like if it hasn't completed within a given amount of time.\r\nThis goes along the same lines of what ccaominh has described above.\r\n\r\nRecently, Amazon announced \"Automatic workload management and query priorities \" for their AWS Redshift product:\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/09/amazon-redshift-announces-automatic-workload-management-and-query-priorities/\r\nThey even boast to use machine learning. I don't like the product but the naming \"automatic workload management\" is nice and it is also interesting that it has \"automatic\" in it, suggesting that resource management is actually something that doesn't require that much tuning and administration but something that kind of can be done almost in a mathematically optimal way.\r\n\r\nI think the current Druid mechanism with query priorities is quite nice, but a priority that is 1 higher than another priority is already completely dominating the query prioritisation. \r\nSo whether using names or numbers to denote a priority, the prioritization should be gradual, not absolutist. Currently, as long as there are segments for a prio:10 query in the processing queue, no single segment for a prio:9 query will be processed. Instead I would think that a probabilistic interpretation of a numeric priority would be smoother. One could then put a higher-level construct on top of that. For instance a query analyzer which can compute how heavy a query is and can map that to a priority which makes sure that the query is neither allowed to starve nor to slow down interactive queries, simply by mapping it to the right numeric priority.\r\nSuch an approach would be nice in that it is such a generic concept that sophisticated features could be realised later on on that foundation. If on the other hand an \"engineered\" approach is taken as a foundation, like a fixed,  predefined number of lanes with fixed, predefined behaviours, then this limits how many later innovations could be put on top of it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n>> More generally, this pair of issues and #4773 (to control which segments can and can not be in the file cache) should make separating Druid clusters into multiple tiers completely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nInteresting!

How I got into referring to this feature as \"resource pools\" is that I was borrowing the name from Vertica. (https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/ResourceManager/ManagingWorkloads.htm?tocpath=Administrator%27s%20Guide%7CManaging%20the%20Database%7CManaging%20Workloads%7C_____0)\r\n\r\nThe Vertica resource pools are a bit more pool-y, they have things like `MAXCONCURRENCY`, `MAXQUERYMEMORYSIZE`, and `PRIORITY` that look like they correspond pretty closely to Druid concepts (see [documentation for CREATE RESOURCE POOL](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Statements/CREATERESOURCEPOOL.htm)).\r\n\r\nThe `RUNTIMECAP` + `CASCADE TO` mechanism doesn't correspond to any current Druid concept, but maybe it should. It is trying to solve the same problem that @ccaominh brought up.\r\n\r\n> Such an approach would be nice in that it is such a generic concept that sophisticated features could be realised later on on that foundation. If on the other hand an \"engineered\" approach is taken as a foundation, like a fixed, predefined number of lanes with fixed, predefined behaviours, then this limits how many later innovations could be put on top of it.\r\n\r\nWould it really be that tough to make the system more flexible in the future? I'd imagine giving the fast and slow lanes special names and then allowing people to define more. We might have to deprecate a couple of config properties, but that doesn't seem too bad.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/534230983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/534334581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8555#issuecomment-534334581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8555","id":534334581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDMzNDU4MQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T00:18:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T00:18:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThis kind of question is exactly why in Druid 0.16.0 we are introducing a `Paste data` inline data option!

What problems in Historical Java processes are you referring here?\r\n\r\nAny problems from degenerate GC behaviour to \"poison queries\" to an upgrade of a part of the Historical fleet with a bug which may lead to crashes of Java servers, but the download servers may be OK and still serving the remaining healthy Historicals which are not upgraded yet.\r\n\r\n> Probably this sidecar should be able to process simple filters, so that row selection as well as column projection could be done in storage historicals.\r\n\r\nIn this design, the network throughput of the Storage shouldn't generally be a bottleneck because currently, Historicals underuse the network resources allocated to them by cloud providers by default (they currently heavily use mem and CPU, but not so much the network).\r\n\r\nAlso, row filtering may sometimes even increase the transmission size anyway because you have to decompress columns.\r\n\r\nFinally, it means much more intrusive dive into programming in a native language and supporting two parallel implementations of segment serialization/deserialization and row filtering: in Java and in a native language.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I doubt implementing filtering on the side of the download servers is a worthwhile addition from the support perspective (i. e. considering the cost of support of parallel logic in two languages).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/534446936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/534481736","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8356#issuecomment-534481736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8356","id":534481736,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDQ4MTczNg==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T09:46:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T09:46:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">On
