Right now Appenderators are only used by the KafkaIndexTask. @javasoze has been working on a custom Appenderator as an extension and wanted to use it with realtime nodes too, which this would help with.\n\nThe motivation for the custom Appenderator is that @javasoze is wanting to create a new segment type based on Lucene indexes rather than the traditional Druid columnar format with smooshes and all that.\n\nThe hope is that with some changes in Druid we could support more than one kind of segment format, where \"base\" queries (like topN, timeseries, groupBy) work on all formats, but maybe additional extension queries only work on specific formats, or maybe certain features (like certain filters) would be implemented in more optimal ways on certain formats.\n\nThe first step towards experimenting with that is making it possible to customize segment creation via implementing a custom Appenderator, which this PR helps with by making that interface usable in realtime nodes. If that works out then we'd also want to make it usable in batch ingestion and in realtime tasks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217037147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217045288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2525#issuecomment-217045288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2525","id":217045288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzA0NTI4OA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T00:18:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T00:18:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@navis some more comments.

The goal though is to make it possible to store a Druid dataSource using some engine other than Druid's traditional storage engine (like Lucene).\n\nProbably in addition to this PR, a sketch of a fuller proposal is,\n- using Appenderator for batch ingestion too (there's already an `Appenderators.offline` builder method that should work for this)\n- somehow abstract over IndexIO so `SegmentLoader` can use different loading strategies for getting `Segment` objects, other than `IndexIO.loadIndex` to allow historicals to load segement with alternative storage engines\n- something in `Segment` that lets query engines get different interfaces other than `QueryableIndex` and `StorageAdapter`, maybe `T as(Class<T> clazz)` where `as(StorageAdapter.class)` would do the same thing as `asStorageAdapter()` but could also be used for interfaces that only exist in extensions. this would allow queries to use features that are only present in alternative storage engines. if those engines also implemented StorageAdapter, then all existing queries would work on them too.\n\nI think these changes could be done in a pretty non-invasive way and then open up some cool possibilities for storage engine extensions.\n\nHopefully this PR can be reviewed before a fuller proposal is ready.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217218492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217222463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2914#issuecomment-217222463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2914","id":217222463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzIyMjQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T17:42:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T17:42:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@gianm maybe a better solution is to remove the parser field from the data schema, since the parser just defines how to read the data, but has nothing to do with the actual schema in Druid\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217222463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217224909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2914#issuecomment-217224909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2914","id":217224909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzIyNDkwOQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-05T17:51:39Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T17:51:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It unfortunately does have to do with the schema, because the parser defines both the data format and the dimensions for the schema.

The runner would accept a `generateBaseline` parameter which would cause the results of that run to be written by the writer with a `baseline` flag; on the next run, the reader would then scan the file and would find the latest events tagged as baseline and use them as the baseline for that run.\n\nTo make this more clear, this is how it might work:\n- JMHRunner is executed; it reads a benchmarks.json file and finds the latest entries for each test (benchmark/parameter combination) that is labelled with the baseline flag\n- If each test in the list of tests to run didn't have a previous run to use as a baseline, the runner aborts and tells the user they need to generate a baseline for that test\n- If there was a baseline for all tests to run (or the runner had the `generateBaseline` parameter specified), the runner would execute the tests (by calling JMH's new Runner().run() which will do the usual process forking stuff) and would return the results of the test\n- The results would be appended to the benchmarks.json file\n- If it wasn't a baseline run, the results would then be compared to the baseline, and if they exceeded some threshold, the runner would exit with failure.\n\nThe proposed format for writing results would be something that is easily ingested into Druid so that we would have the option to use Druid to monitor performance tests (in the same way we use Druid for metrics monitoring, because Druid is da best).

it would be pretty cool if we could do something like:\n- create a new EC2 instance and load the JMH runner JAR with the benchmarks\n- read a baseline file from S3\n- run the tests\n- write the results to Tranquility Server for ingestion into Druid\n- terminate the EC2 instance\n\n### Metrics and Threshold\n\nJMH's benchmark \"score\" is calculated as the mean result over all the runs (not including warmups). It is supplemented with a \"score error\", which is the mean error at a 99.9% confidence interval. If the confidence interval is too wide (due to not enough iterations or wild variance during the iterations), the score error will be large proportional to the score. I think it makes sense to fail test runs if the scoreError/score ratio exceeds a certain threshold, since this means that the result is unreliable and not that meaningful anyway. This could be because of too few iterations, too much variance going on in the testing environment, or a badly written test. In any case, comparing say a baseline of [1000ops/sec] with a result of [1000ops/sec +/- 1000ops/sec] is a pretty useless comparison and should be a failure.\n\nWe can also get percentiles from the JMH results (in the above example I'm storing the p50, p90, p95, and p99). I'm undecided as to whether it is really necessary to capture percentiles as I believe performance benchmark results should be fairly normally distributed and hence the mean + CI should be good. Looking for any thoughts on this.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nThe primary alternative I see to building our own runner is to use JMH's Maven script to build a benchmarks.jar file, configure it to write the results to a file, and then write scripts to parse and act on the output generated by calling `java -jar target/benchmarks.jar`. I think building our own runner has a number of advantages over this, the main ones being the ability to check before running the benchmarks to make sure we have baselines available, and the ability to output the results to a format we want directly from their Java RunResult object instead of parsing their output file.\n\nThere are also plugins for [Jenkins](https://github.com/brianfromoregon/jmh-plugin) and [TeamCity](https://github.com/presidentio/teamcity-plugin-jmh) available; I haven't looked too much into them as I don't know that we want to tie ourselves to any specific build framework (and I like the idea of being able to emit results in a format that we can ingest into Druid).\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217962307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/217972449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2938#issuecomment-217972449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2938","id":217972449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzk3MjQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T20:01:22Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T20:01:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
