Does mvnd fit in that use case?\r\n\r\nmvnd is just like maven but it has a warmed up daemon running in the background. Additionally the mvnd launcher is a native image which makes execution time of maven commands very fast while the \"regular\" hotspot JVM running the the background keeps as much state as possible without having to parse the pom again and again etc. Just point NetBeans to the mvnd installation instead of regular maven and most builds should \"just work\".\r\n\r\nmvnd runs many tasks in parallel, which is the main reason why some projects with more exotic plugins might fail. I have seen it happening before, but since maven and mvnd are a drop-in replacement its usually not a big deal - I simply switched back on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNB 17 will have some mvnd specific fixes since the maven output looks slightly different which confused the stacktrace linker and things like that.

There are multiple issues (for example there are people here, that think gradle is not a great build system) and there are already people out there, that tried to convert the build to gradle and have not yet succeeded. As said this is a major issue and at this point in time I'd veto any PR, that tries to introduce a mix of build systems.\r\n\r\n> dear, can i do PR's that removed some compile warnings or you also skip it?\r\n\r\nNot sure what you try to say. I can't speak for \"we\", but for me: I will look at PRs in the pace that I can manage, while also progressing \"my\" pet issues.  You can ask on the mailing list for more committers to look.\r\n\r\nAt this point in time PRs that touch many file are a bad idea, as currently the release for 17 is being prepared (as announced on the mailing list).\r\n\r\n> Can i make supercommit with replacing \" + \" into \"append\" change there SB already used? \r\n\r\nIf you mean you want to change this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\nsb.append(\"Hallo\" + \"Welt\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```java\r\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\nsb.append(\"Hallo\");\r\nsb.append(\"Welt\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSure. But remember: You need to motivate people to review. In my mind, if the code is not performance critical, the first form is not optimal, but works and thus does not need to change. If you fix a real bug and change it then, it is a different matter.\r\n\r\nAll this is IMHO and others might feel differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1405270535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1405282051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5368#issuecomment-1405282051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5368","id":1405282051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5TwucD","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-26T16:37:37Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T16:37:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lbownik  and @tbw777 \r\n> But I'm not allowed to make that kind of changes anymore\r\n\r\nThis is nonsense.
