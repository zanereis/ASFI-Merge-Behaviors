The `rockermq ` project has all the required files and the documents to help you configure your IDE, but you have to do some changes and adapt some part to match your local configuration:\n\n1. My OS: **Window 11 Pro**\n2. Read and configure your IDE according to the [CONTRIBUTION GUIDE](https://eventmesh.apache.org/community/contribute/contribute/)\n3. Create a folder, lets say `rocketmq` where you will clone 3 different projects:\n    - [rocketmq](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq)\n    - [rocketmq-docker](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-docker)\n    - [rocketmq-dashboard](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-dashboard) \n4. In the `rocketmq-docker` project you will find a folder named `scripts` in the following path: `rocketmq-docker/scripts`. Copy this folder in your root folder `rocketmq`. This folder contains the scripts to start `rocketmq ` component (proxy, nameserver and broker)\n\nAt this point I have created custom `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfiles ` and a build file to run `rocketmq ` in docker compose. The compose file in mostly inspired by the one provided in the [documentation](https://rocketmq.apache.org/docs/quickStart/03quickstartWithDockercompose). \nThe important modification in the compose file are:\n\n- the use of custom docker images of `rocketmq ` components build locally\n- the integration of the image of the dashboard built locally\n\n5. To activate the debugging mode, you have to uncomment  line **67** in the `rocketmq\\scripts\\runbroker-customize.sh` file. This mean you should configure your IDE to communicate with the same port in container\n6. The same thing is applied for the `rocketmq-dashboard` project with a different port already configured in the `compose.yaml` file\n\n### Warning 1: because of some issue with the `proxy ` component, I had to use the image available on the docker hub\n### Warning 2: a common error that will appear is the following **connect to <null> failed** with the dashboard container. You will the find some solutions in the **Troubleshoopting.md** file in the rocketmq repository.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/206790d5-b6b3-474f-94d9-1423e2545e39)\n\n7. You will find the content of the files I am using to build my local project. You can bring any modification, I will be happy have you point of vue.\n\n**compose.yaml**\n\n```\nversion: '3.8'\nservices:\n  namesrv:\n    image: hattorihenzo/rocketmq-broker-dev:latest\n    container_name: rmqnamesrv\n    ports:\n      - 9876:9876\n    networks:\n      - rocketmq\n    command: sh mqnamesrv\n  broker:\n    image: hattorihenzo/rocketmq-broker-dev:latest\n    container_name: rmqbroker\n    ports:\n      - 9555:9555\n      - 10909:10909\n      - 10911:10911\n      - 10912:10912\n    environment:\n      - NAMESRV_ADDR=rmqnamesrv:9876\n    depends_on:\n      - namesrv\n    networks:\n      - rocketmq\n    command: sh mqbroker\n  proxy:\n    image: apache/rocketmq:5.3.1\n    container_name: rmqproxy\n    networks:\n      - rocketmq\n    depends_on:\n      - broker\n      - namesrv\n    ports:\n      - 8080:8080\n      - 8081:8081\n    restart: on-failure\n    environment:\n      - NAMESRV_ADDR=rmqnamesrv:9876\n    command: sh mqproxy\n  dashboard:\n    image: hattorihenzo/rocketmq-dashboard-dev:latest\n    container_name: rmqdashboard\n    networks:\n      - rocketmq\n    ports:\n      - 9090:8282\n      - 5005:5005\n    environment:\n      - JAVA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -Drocketmq.namesrv.addr=rmqnamesrv:9876\n      - NAMESRV_ADDR=rmqnamesrv:9876\nnetworks:\n  rocketmq:\n    driver: bridge\n\n```\n\n**Dockerfile.broker**\n\n```\n#\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n# contributor license agreements.

In RocketMQ’s implementation, maxMsgNums (which corresponds to pullBatchSize) cannot be 0, as this prevents correct access to the logical queue.\n\nSpecifically:\n\t1.\tIn your code, you did not set consumer.WithPullBatchSize(), which caused the default value of 0 to be used.\n\t2.\tWhen this value is sent to the server, stricter parameter checks in the RocksDB storage mode result in message pull failures.\n\t3.\tIn the default ConsumeQueue storage mode, this issue might not be apparent due to fault tolerance mechanisms, but in RocksDB mode, it directly fails.\n\nSolutions\n\nShort-term Solution:\nExplicitly set pullBatchSize when creating the Pull Consumer:\n\npullConsumer, err = rocketmq.NewPullConsumer(\n    consumer.WithGroupName(consumerGroupName),\n    consumer.WithNameServer(nameSrv),\n    consumer.WithMaxReconsumeTimes(2),\n    consumer.WithPullBatchSize(32), // Add this line and set a reasonable value (1-1024)\n)\n\nLong-term Solutions:\n\t1.\tSet a reasonable default value (e.g., 32) for pullBatchSize in the Go client.\n\t2.\tAdd parameter validation to ensure that pullBatchSize falls within a valid range (1-1024).\n\t3.\tImprove the documentation to clearly explain the requirements and limitations of this parameter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2617835409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2623216131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/7801#issuecomment-2623216131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7801","id":2623216131,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86cWxoD","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-30T00:09:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T00:09:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is stale because it has been open for 365 days with no activity.
