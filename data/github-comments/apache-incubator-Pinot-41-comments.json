Given that our docs frequently get appended, this will be a pain. UMP team which earlier used readthedocs moved away from it. So I presume it didn't work out well.\r\n\r\nLet's review what other solutions we have. Github wiki is not a bad option to consider.

Apache Incubator had the restriction on releasing non-apache approved releases to public. The policy seems that as long as we publish the docker image created from the official apache releases (e.g. 0.1.0), it's fine. But, it's NOT ok to publish any arbitrary version that did not go through the voting process.\r\n\r\nSome guideline from the general@incubator for docker is the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDocker\r\n\r\nArtefacts need to be placed in https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/<project> or https://hub.docker.com/u/apache<project>/<project>\r\n\r\nTo comply with ASF release and distributions please ensue the following:\r\n- The overview should include the incubator disclaimer.\r\n- The docker file should include an ASF header.\r\n- The docker file should include the incubator disclaimer.\r\n- \"docker pull apache/<project>\" should not install an artefact containing unapproved code.\r\n- Release candidates, nightly or snapshots need to be clearly tagged.\r\n- The latest tag should not point to an artefact containing unapproved code e.g. to master or dev branches or to a RC or snapshot.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome related
