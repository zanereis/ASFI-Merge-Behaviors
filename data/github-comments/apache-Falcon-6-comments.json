for the churn on this and thank you for taking this up @prongs. This is a very valuable addition to the project.\n\nI agree with @bvellanki 's observations but I am satisfied with @prongs approach. Things may seem bit unorganized but for sake of smaller commits and moving forward I think this is the correct approach. Also, it shouldn't impact any of the existing functionality so is a low risk change. This has been pending for quite some time and couple of iterations have already been done without any blocker issues, so I will commit this after 24 hours unless someone shouts out :-)

@pallavi-rao I propose to use Apache Yetus. It has several benefits over the existing approach\n1. Generating changes.txt from jira is much more flexible than from commit messages. \n   As I noted earlier also, commits can't be modified, so if a developer forgets to attach metadata / attaches wrong metadata then generating release notes will be incorrect.\n2. Yetus provides nice markdown formatted change log with links to each issue. They are easy to read and you can go to the jira by clicking through the github.\n3. It can also automate the generation of release notes, if we add them to corresponding JIRA.\n4. We don't need to write / maintain and go through all the existing/future learning that YETUS went through.\n\nI have tested it and will send a pull request for the docs generated for all the releases

YETUS.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/231164659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/231166386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/falcon/pull/213#issuecomment-231166386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/213","id":231166386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTE2NjM4Ng==","user":{"login":"ying-eng","id":10202347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAyMzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10202347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng","html_url":"https://github.com/ying-eng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ying-eng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T18:29:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T18:29:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/231166386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/231168064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/falcon/pull/33#issuecomment-231168064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/33","id":231168064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTE2ODA2NA==","user":{"login":"ajayyadava","id":373156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzE1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/373156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava","html_url":"https://github.com/ajayyadava","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajayyadava/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T18:35:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T18:35:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In
