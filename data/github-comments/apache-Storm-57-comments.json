\nI don't understand the EventHub system well enough to really be able to judge if the code is functioning properly in corner cases, etc.  I get at a high level what it does (http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/) but I have never used it myself.  The code itself looks OK, but I am not comfortable voting on it either way with my current knowledge.  \n\nI am a bit nervous about pulling this in as we don't have a very good way to test it beyond the unit tests. EventHubs is a Microsoft Azure specific system.  I cannot spin up my own instance of it to validate that the code is doing what I expect prior to a release.  Although it may be a bit painful, I can do that for Kafka, Redis, HDFS, and HBase integration that we have accepted in so far.  That doesn't mean we cannot/should not pull it in.

I will take a look at the complete PR today.\n\nNot to derail the discussion but personally, I would much rather not store errors in zk at all if its just for rendering the errors in UI. If the spouts/bolts could just store this in memory with some expiration that should suffice and we could expose  an API at worker layer to get this information directly from it. If the host dies you lose some errors but that does not seem like a big deal. The only downside will be ui would now have to make requests against worker hosts to get erros but that seems ok to me, you would also get parallelism as all these worker calls can be made in parallel.

I converted SupervisorInfo, Assignment and StormBase to thrift structures and I am now working on converting the ZkWorkerHeartBeat to thrift.While working on thriftifying these structures I have realized that the defrecords for all these structures are pretty meaningless. The code does not really adhere to fields defined in defrecord and does not take advantage of defrecord structure in any way(no defaults, no validations, not implementing any protocol or interfaces, not used in any multimethods). It treats these structures as open maps and that is actually very very confusing. For example StormBase does not define \"delay_secs\" or \"previous_state\" as fields but when we do rebalance or kill transition we still store this information as part of StormBase instance.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest way to address this jira would be to just get rid of these defrecords and instead create mk-X methods for each one of them which just returns a map representing the structure. The reason serialization breaks currently is because defrecords are treated as java classes and serialized accordingly. If we just make all these structure open maps that is no longer an issue. If the code starts making assumptions about certain keys will always exist in the map that is equivalent to adding a new required field in the thrift structure which is not going to be backward compatible anyways. You would think we will lose some redability if things were marked as maps instead of predefined types but I think we will actually gain redability as we are not respecting the defined type anyways which again is super confusing. The only advantage I see for moving to thrift at this point would be for future projects like moving the heartbeat from zookeeper to nimbus. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"revans2\">Robert Joseph Evans</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ptgoetz\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"ptgoetz\">P.

Right now I have the plumbing in place to send a \"load\" measurement for each bolt in the worker to a worker that is connected to it.  This is sent through the messaging layer, so there is no global state, but a local state for what each worker is connected to. I have an alternative version of the shuffle grouping that uses psudo random numbers to pick a downstream bolt.  The probability of picking the downstream bolt is more or less inversely proportional to the load on the bolt.  All of that seems to be working fairly well, but where I am running into issues is what should the \"load\" truly be.  Currently calculate I as </p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">boltLoad = max(localBoltLoad, messagingClientLoad);\nlocalBoltLoad = boltInputQueuePopulation/boltInputQueueCapacity;\nmessagingClientLoad = min(1024,clientMessagesPending)/1024;\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n\n<p>All of this seems to work OK, but I am a bit nervous about spikes in load, and also in overall latency.  The goal behind this is to be able to deal with heterogeneous hardware and heterogeneous load. With acking enabled and a truly the current shuffle implementation the total throughput of the topology is limited by the slowest path through it, and I would like to decouple them.  If we are polling the instantaneous load and there is a spike that we quickly recover from the bolt we be slowed down for the entire polling period.  Also if we are going off of queue length and we reach a stable point, inherently that stable point will have some number more entries in the queue for the slower bolts, so any tuple that is unlucky enough to be assigned to a slow bolt will take a double latency hit, it will not only have to be processed by a slower bolt, but it will also have to wait in a longer line to do it. Do others think the capacity metric would be a better measure, perhaps a combination of the two?</p>\n\n<p>I think for now I am just going to try and get the framework in place, and a shuffle implementation that can be configured to the original behavior.  Then after that we can play around with it and see how it performs.  But I would like feedback on it if others have good ideas.
