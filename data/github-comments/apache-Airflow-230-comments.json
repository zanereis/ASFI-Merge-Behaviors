I was wondering though, how does this work with the `Rendered` view in the web-UI?

But I guess it should work the exact same way as today: `BaseOperator.render_template` has not changed... Then if template fields are currently rendered in this `Rendered` view, they should still be rendered (and nested ones also).\r\n\r\nI will try to take a look at this view soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/497835880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/497836581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5330#issuecomment-497836581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5330","id":497836581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzgzNjU4MQ==","user":{"login":"pgagnon","id":12717218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzE3MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12717218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon","html_url":"https://github.com/pgagnon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-31T19:41:06Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T19:41:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Fokko I'm still investigating what's going on.
