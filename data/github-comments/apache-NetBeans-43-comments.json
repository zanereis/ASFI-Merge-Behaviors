Let's take this piece of code for discussion before my change:\r\n\r\n`Class clazz = cl.loadClass(\"org.jboss.as.controller.client.helpers.Operations\");`\r\n\r\nSo what Netbeans is doing is loading a Class and removing the type information by setting it to a raw type. \r\n\r\nMy change simply maintains that type information. I know it's a pretty generic statement. But, the Java Language Standard, sec. 4.8 says the following:\r\n\r\n> The use of raw types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code. The use of raw types in code written after the introduction of generics into the Java programming language is strongly discouraged. It is possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow the use of raw types. \r\n\r\nWhy does this code exist? My rookie opinion is this code is \"old\" and therefore was never designed to work with generics in the first place. \r\n\r\nAlso, given the limited resources I'm not sure things like this will ever be fixed properly. There are simply more pressing needs.\r\n\r\nAs we fix more of these raw type errors, it should make us more diligent in terms of creating better code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/522731901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/522857163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1412#issuecomment-522857163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1412","id":522857163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjg1NzE2Mw==","user":{"login":"jGauravGupta","id":15934072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTM0MDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15934072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta","html_url":"https://github.com/jGauravGupta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T05:19:16Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T05:19:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @peedeeboy,\r\n\r\nI have fixed the ergonomics error, May you test the PR again with the latest commit?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/522857163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/522968332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1203#issuecomment-522968332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1203","id":522968332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjk2ODMzMg==","user":{"login":"branscha","id":279746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTc0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/279746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha","html_url":"https://github.com/branscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-20T11:18:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T11:18:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@oyarzun @ebarboni Yes that seems to be the case.
