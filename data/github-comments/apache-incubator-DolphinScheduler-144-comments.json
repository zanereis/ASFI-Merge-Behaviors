This maybe more convenient and easy-understanding.\r\n\r\nYeah, this is the first step we make, but we wish it could be more powerful. We could support python functional task later, such as\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@task\r\ndef func_task():\r\n    print('This function could run in DolphinScheduler')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef func_task_follow():\r\n    print('A task run after `func_task` success')\r\n\r\nwith process_definition('workflow_name') as pd:\r\n    func_task >> func_task_follow\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich mean that our python could be run in DolphinScheduler. But I'm not pretty sure could we run pyflink or pyspark code like that cause this need flink and spark environment, but we hope it could.\r\n\r\nIf you have idea please let me know, or you could join us to build this feature together if you interested in this\r\n\r\n[1]: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra4fd314479930ac91efdf6917b9747f3328c8378b6a1a50be2cc6465%40%3Cdev.dolphinscheduler.apache.org%3E","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/939654995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/939657424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6407#issuecomment-939657424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/6407","id":939657424,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms44AgjQ","user":{"login":"zuston","id":8609142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDkxNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8609142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston","html_url":"https://github.com/zuston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-11T03:56:58Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T03:56:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds great! @zhongjiajie \r\n\r\n> But I'm not pretty sure could we run pyflink or pyspark code like that cause this need flink and spark environment, but we hope it could.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure but if implemented, it's exciting.
