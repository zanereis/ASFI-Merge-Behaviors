I'm asking because in that case, I think it makes more sense to concatenate the services files rather than hard-coding fs impls in Druid code. Hard-coding the impls in Druid wouldn't help for other FS types (like S3) unless we add them all, and the strategy of adding these things in the code would tie us more closely to a particular version of hadoop.\n\nFwiw, what I've seen work for self contained jars in the past is using the maven shade plugin with a configuration like:\n\n``` xml\n<plugin>\n  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n  <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>\n  <executions>\n    <execution>\n      <phase>package</phase>\n      <goals>\n        <goal>shade</goal>\n      </goals>\n      <configuration>\n        <shadedArtifactAttached>true</shadedArtifactAttached>\n        <shadedClassifierName>selfcontained</shadedClassifierName>\n        <transformers>\n          <transformer implementation=\"org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.AppendingTransformer\">\n            <resource>META-INF/services/org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem</resource>\n          </transformer>\n        </transformers>\n      </configuration>\n    </execution>\n  </executions>\n</plugin>\n```\n\nThis will concatenate the listed services files together so different files from different jars don't clobber each other. There may be something equivalent for the assembly plugin.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114988760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114992942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/726#issuecomment-114992942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/726","id":114992942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDk5Mjk0Mg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T19:55:40Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T19:55:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@davideanastasia, sorry for letting this fall by the wayside.

So, I'm going to close this PR, but please let us know if you still have problems after running a version of Druid that includes #1428.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114995336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114996771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1462#issuecomment-114996771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1462","id":114996771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDk5Njc3MQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T20:12:38Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T20:12:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/114996771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115001409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1462#issuecomment-115001409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1462","id":115001409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTAwMTQwOQ==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T20:29:09Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T20:29:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115001409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115006277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/723#issuecomment-115006277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/723","id":115006277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTAwNjI3Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T20:45:03Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T20:45:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@davideanastasia, this looks good to me.

It looks like we are wrapping the child QueryRunner to get metrics, which is a way to get metrics, but I think we should move that instrumentation into the DirectDruidClient.  Reasons are\n1. The metrics are intended to measure the amount of time spent when talking to the child node.  Instrumenting directly in DirectDruidClient ensures the semantics of the metrics won't change.  Using this wrapping here introduces the possibility that other things are pushed into pipeline which muddy the specific semantics we are looking for\n2. It would be great to have an indication of how much time was spent during network transfer apart from how much time is spent receiving the first entry.  This can only really be gotten by instrumenting the http callbacks in the DirectDruidClient\n\nIt might or might not also fix whatever performance thing is happening, but I think we should look at moving this for semantic reasons anyway.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115782208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115810252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1467#issuecomment-115810252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1467","id":115810252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTgxMDI1Mg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-26T17:50:07Z","updated_at":"2015-06-26T17:50:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In agreement with @cheddar 's comments I have retained the removal of the metric at this location for the time being. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115810252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/115828577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1463#issuecomment-115828577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1463","id":115828577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTgyODU3Nw==","user":{"login":"michaelschiff","id":1669670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1669670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelschiff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelschiff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-26T18:44:28Z","updated_at":"2015-06-26T18:44:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Initial work:\n2743da386a3f3d4649d0c47306f7f990ec7a76f3\n\nThe scope of changes is pretty minimal.
