However, if there is no backward incompatibility with the Kafka clients (meaning that any 2.x client can talk to any 2.x broker - we would need to double check), I'd recommend to just keep using the existing ``nifi-kafka-2-0-nar`` and update the client version and add any property that would make sense.

This would easily work around your issue, each session in a session controller could be named `session-1`, `session-2`, etc...\r\n\r\nNote: Livy never updated the documentation when they added this feature (https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/48).  But it looks like you just replace the sessionId with the name when making calls.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/644782068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/644870542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4328#issuecomment-644870542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4328","id":644870542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDg3MDU0Mg==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-16T16:26:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T16:26:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @feitgraph I was able to startup a single cluster node with the zookeeper intentionally not started.
