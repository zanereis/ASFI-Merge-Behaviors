In test_forward.py(for Tensorflow Front-end), I could see that while creating the TVM Graph, they use \"NCHW\" layout by-default and currently there is no option to pass the \"NCDHW\" layout information in the same file. So, I guess we might have to set the layout from somewhere else(may be tensorflow.py in the new function for 3d pooling?), otherwise it will require design changes in existing test_forward.py

This PR provides an interface (annotation) for specialized codegen to do subgraph pattern matching for fusion or similar optimization. However, we also realize that this may be painful for developers and it might be better to provide a more convenient pattern matching for widely used cases (e.g., Conv+BN+ReLU as you mentioned). Our follow-up plans to focus more on the graph partitioning algorithm, and this is one of the cases we want to cover.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/569204482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/569205106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4590#issuecomment-569205106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4590","id":569205106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTIwNTEwNg==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-27T06:54:08Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T06:54:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen I keep NDArray's C++ interface adding const qualifier, but leave C's API as original interface.
