Please include me in all reviews.  Here are the steps I would follow. These will make sure that the feature is NOT enabled until the very end, and each can be tested independently -- either manually or via unit/integration tests added in the PR itself.\r\n\r\n1. PR for server to download a segment (be it realtime or offline). Download should happen either with http or https endpoints. Both should be possible, depending on the config supplied (at server level, so we can use indexingTableConfig for this). You can add a test in the integ test to download one existing realtime segment in LLRealtimeClusterInteg test. Use http or https downloader already available. Since this is a spec change, please include the spec (exact URI you plan to use, etc.) in your design doc, and send out an email to devs, and add in general slack channel\r\n\r\n2. Introduce an Uploader abstraction, that will upload a segment to either controller or deep store. Make sure this class is unit tested, tested to work with your deepstore, but is not used anywhere else yet (except for tests of course)\r\n\r\n3. Change the Split committer to use the uploader abstraction introduced, instead of current hard- oded controller-only. This PR maybe can go wth (2) depending on how but (2) gets.\r\n\r\n4. Introduce a peer downloader (but do not hook it up yet), based on either http or https downloader, depending on configuration. Maybe we dont even need this, so you can even skip this step. We can directly use http or https downloader\r\n\r\nThis completes phase-1\r\n\r\nIn phase-2, we will do:\r\n\r\n5. Intoduce a table config (inside stream config? or maybe in indexing config?) a boolean on whether to abort split commit if upload to deep store fails. This config is not used anywhere as yet. Since this is an architectural change, be sure to email dev mailing list, and also post in slack. Get consensus on where the config should go, and what exactly it means, naming, etc. These things can take time, and are not changeable once introduced.\r\n \r\n5. Change the controller to accept a new URL in the protocol (I suggest we insert the following when segment upload fails: \"peer://peer/URI_INTRODUCED_IN_STEP_1\". Or, simply the word in all caps \"PEER\". I like the previous option, because it is in URI format, and the controller can do one check with the URL decoder for the scheme. When the controller detects peer, it should not set the download URL in  the metadata (or, insert a null, but I prefer NO url  in metadata). Add unit tests to cover this case. Since the server never inserts PEER, we should be good so far.\r\n\r\n6. Change the server to include logic to fetch from peer (using http or https fetcher as configured) IF the fetch from deep store fails, include retries as discussed in phone conference. (i.e. try deep store, if. it fails, try peer, if that fails, try the whole sequence again, N times). Try not to hook up this logic as yet. Add unit tests\r\n\r\n7.

Intoduce a table config (inside stream config? or maybe in indexing config?) a boolean on whether to abort split commit if upload to deep store fails. This config is not used anywhere as yet. Since this is an architectural change, be sure to email dev mailing list, and also post in slack. Get consensus on where the config should go, and what exactly it means, naming, etc. These things can take time, and are not changeable once introduced.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this new config? It looks like we can achieve the same goal by adding a new parameter to control if to upload segment to controller? This is what I have done in the POC. The new segment committer in 2/3 above can invoke this new endpoint.  https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/4914/files#diff-f0bd4d0172521b3f6bd52d4ebe12da2b\r\n\r\nShouldn't changing the LLC protocol endpoint be easier than adding a new table config?\r\n\r\n> 2. Change the controller to accept a new URL in the protocol (I suggest we insert the following when segment upload fails: \"peer://peer/URI_INTRODUCED_IN_STEP_1\". Or, simply the word in all caps \"PEER\". I like the previous option, because it is in URI format, and the controller can do one check with the URL decoder for the scheme. When the controller detects peer, it should not set the download URL in  the metadata (or, insert a null, but I prefer NO url  in metadata). Add unit tests to cover this case. Since the server never inserts PEER, we should be good so far.\r\n\r\nI see. So  Pinot servers will not return an empty segment location to controller, right?\r\n\r\n> 3. Change the server to include logic to fetch from peer (using http or https fetcher as configured) IF the fetch from deep store fails, include retries as discussed in phone conference.

I believe segmentTarDir is cleaned up automatically, but if not, we need to add code to do that.\r\n\r\nYes, my bad Not sure how I missed it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/614136129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/614136404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5221#issuecomment-614136404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5221","id":614136404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDEzNjQwNA==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T16:17:24Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T16:17:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chenboat  I have merged your PR, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/614136404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/614216228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5238#issuecomment-614216228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5238","id":614216228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDIxNjIyOA==","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T18:49:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T18:49:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We missed to discuss the pros/cons of using Groovy on the design doc, apologies.

Perhaps starting with the record extractor, but you decide.\r\n> Regarding your open questions:\r\n> 1 . We face this problem because json and csv dont have any schema. Should we introduce the concept of an input schema ? Should we pick the schema from the first record? (what if it has null for some field, and we find the field later? Should we dictate that the first record MUST have all the fields they ever expect to see in the input, and take that to be the schema? Just adding some ideas for consideration. Some related discussion in PR #4968\r\n\r\nInputSchema seems like the cleanest solution. But that's more configuration and more scope for error for the user. Giving it more thought, I think the current implementation will work fine, because most often, the same input format will be used for all pushes to the same table. The problem arises only if someone keeps switching between input formats of the data.\r\n> 2. Can we assume pinot defaults if input to transform function is null? This will work until we support more input types than pinot itself supports -- far-fetched I think.\r\n\r\nRight now, I think the best way forward is to let the function handle it. The function definition will change only if someone uses data with different input formats to push to the same schema (if they use Avro once and it succeeds, but then they use CSV and the function fails) - which is not a common practical case.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/614230483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/614287400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5250#issuecomment-614287400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5250","id":614287400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNDI4NzQwMA==","user":{"login":"jackjlli","id":35080149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDgwMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35080149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli","html_url":"https://github.com/jackjlli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackjlli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-15T21:23:37Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T21:23:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">
