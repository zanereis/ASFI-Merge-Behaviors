Are there numbers, that show the char variant is faster or what is the reason for this change?\r\n> \r\n> I was trusting the `Inspect & Transform` tool, but now I am testing if this is still true and running some benchmarks. Will update this PR soon and share what I find.\r\n\r\nindexOf/lastIndexOf are still slightly faster on modern JDKs if chars are used. But there is no difference anymore for StringBuilder.append which is intrinsified and should perform identical in both variants.\r\n\r\nFor consistency reasons I often default to chars whenever possible - instead of single-char-Strings - so that i don't have to remember the details.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                          Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nCharVsStringJMH.appendChar         avgt    5  4.493 ± 0.052  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.appendString       avgt    5  4.282 ± 0.028  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.indexOfChar        avgt    5  4.112 ± 0.015  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.indexOfString      avgt    5  5.333 ± 0.187  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.lastIndexOfChar    avgt    5  1.979 ± 0.007  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.lastIndexOfString  avgt    5  2.802 ± 0.038  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.replaceChar        avgt    5  6.932 ± 0.020  ns/op\r\nCharVsStringJMH.replaceString      avgt    5  6.948 ± 0.045  ns/op\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/947981709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/948050568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3227#issuecomment-948050568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3227","id":948050568,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M44ghqI","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-20T21:28:59Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T21:28:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jlahoda done, updated the test + I moved the two .pass files around since i believe they are meant to be in the folder for 14 and not 1.8.\r\n\r\nPinging @matthiasblaesing, maybe we can get this fix for a (fairly annoying) bug in too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/948050568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/948058140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3171#issuecomment-948058140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3171","id":948058140,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M44gjgc","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-20T21:42:44Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T21:42:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing @jlahoda any chance to get this integrated?

Everytime I saw someone messing with the default `file.encoding` the error was elsewhere (mostly broken uses of Writers without a charset configured) and changing it breaks other things. People already have to deal with different `file.encoding` settings. mac OS and Linux both default to UTF-8, to my knowledge only Windows uses different code pages. So when you move from windows to linux you already see differences.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/950097265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/950110759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3265#issuecomment-950110759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3265","id":950110759,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M44oYon","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-23T07:34:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T07:34:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"consistency.
