updated the file. This will be used to test the build process of mxnet.js from the latest emscripten version (built from source) to ensure stability. Emscripten has to be built on ubuntu (and windows) and not apt installed since the apt version on ubuntu is old and fails when building MXNet.js, however on Mac the brew version is sufficiently recent such that this isn't a problem. If we want to standardize on a particular versions of emscripten we can checkout specific hashes in the repo before build.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/292656311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
