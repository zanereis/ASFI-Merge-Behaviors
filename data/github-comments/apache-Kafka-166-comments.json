there any risk that suppressing the log message will have the opposite problem of concealing the fact that the topic doesn't exist (you may have to search way back in the history to find the message)? Or maybe if we added more information to the TimeoutException as suggested by @omkreddy, then we could reduce the log level to DEBUG?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/279580364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/279583704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2492#issuecomment-279583704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2492","id":279583704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTU4MzcwNA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T01:54:26Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T01:54:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
