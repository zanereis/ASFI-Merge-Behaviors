The record output in MR log was much more than that in 5.13.0. This problem can be difficult to detect when importing small tables, and the larger the data volume, the more significant the delay.So I compared the changes of Hbase-import-job in SQOOP between the two versions and found the problem here.\r\n        I think this is an easy-fix for HBase developers, so there is not much description in the issue.\r\nThis change is also easy to understand, since it was added to the mutationList when PUT was initialized, and no subsequent PUT needs to be added again. Otherwise, the PUT will be recorded repeatedly in the generated HFILE.\r\n        I looked at SQOOP-3149, and there is no explanation for this
