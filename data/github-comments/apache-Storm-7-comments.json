href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=klausschaefers\">klausschaefers</a>:</i>\n<p>Hi, I have created a prototype for a graph based dashboard.  The visualization is a little different than the other examples in this task. There are just boxes connected with lines. The boxes should present the different components and the lines the data flowing between them. Also this boxes have little mine dash boards inside so you can see some custom metrics. Its more design as a monitoring solution that runs on a big screen in you ops center. Nonetheless it might be a good starting point. </p>\n\n<p>You can find the code here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/v3080/streamui\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/v3080/streamui</a></p>\n\n<p>And a demo at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://vommond.de/streamui/streamui.html#method=showToplogy&id=WordCount\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://vommond.de/streamui/streamui.html#method=showToplogy&id=WordCount</a></p>\n\n<p>The entire UI is written in JS and communicates via REST with a server to get data about the topology and the metrics. As it is a prototype I can easily change the json format. Let me know if you are interesting in using it.</p>\n\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n<p>Klaus</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612432211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/40416426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/18#issuecomment-40416426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/18","id":40416426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDE2NDI2","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-14T20:50:41Z","updated_at":"2014-04-14T20:50:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One minor comment.

Storm's dependencies are not embedded in an uber jar.  The user's jar is an uber jar.  Storm's classpath always has prescience over the user classpath.  So in any case where there could be a conflict storm's version wins.  This helps ensure that the storm framework works as expected, but does make it difficult for end users, especially for jars that are not needed by the worker.  The plan to handle this long term is two fold.  First to split the worker/client and its dependencies off from the rest of storm-core.  This would then let things like ring and hiccup that are only needed by ui and logviewer from interfering with end user code.  After that we would start to look at shading more of the libraries that are dependencies of storm, so that end user code can pick their own versions.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/40539590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/74#issuecomment-40539590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/74","id":40539590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTM5NTkw","user":{"login":"bbaugher","id":2530095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher","html_url":"https://github.com/bbaugher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbaugher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-15T21:56:50Z","updated_at":"2014-04-15T21:56:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I didn't have a JIRA.
