A couple of reasons:\r\n* We now have ~30 modules. We'll probably have 50+ sometime this year. Guava is not that small in size -- bringing in so many copies is just wasteful for a simple call to, say, `Preconditions`. Minimization could mitigate this concern, but I'm yet-to-be-convinced it works well for libraries.\r\n* We care that Guava is not leaked to our users -- this is totally legit. On the other hand, we don't have a strong reason to avoid Guava on an internal interface between, say, `runners-core` and `core-sdk`. It just doesn't matter to users. Of course, taking a stronger stance can be fine, but I'm a little worried it will bite us (for no real reason).\r\n* Build time.\r\n\r\nSeparately, the amount of \"magic\" worries me too. This will work perfectly in Maven, but what happens when someone imports it into Eclipse, IntelliJ or elsewhere? At least in some IDEs, it will fail.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I'm really strongly in favor of one common configuration. There's literally zero chance that this will work if this configuration is offloaded to every single module. This one outweighs them all for me. (And, I was bitten by Guava 19 vs. 20 just today -- so, I know the pain.)\r\n\r\nIn summary, I'm leaning towards +1 on this. However, I'd be more comfortable if we were explicit in saying:\r\n* how much the build time has gone up\r\n* how much the total bundled jar, across the project, has gone up\r\n* to investigate minimization (separately from this PR)\r\n* that we'll make enforcement that Guava in not brought in transitively (which is currently broken at least in one module).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/284312792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/284318810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1739#issuecomment-284318810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1739","id":284318810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDMxODgxMA==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T07:09:37Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T07:09:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Rebase, back on the original `StorageLevelTest`.
