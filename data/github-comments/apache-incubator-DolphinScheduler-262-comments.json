If you want to reduce the dispatchFailed log, I have fixed the sleep logic in #10631. If there is no worker, the master will not dead loop now.\r\n\r\n> In fact, I don't think we need to use a dispatch failed queue and set the maxDispatchSize for a task.\r\n> \r\n> Dispatch failed due to the worker network error, this should have nothing to do with the task. So the correct thing is to find the dispatch failed worker, and `separate` it rather than separate the task.\r\n> \r\n> And I remember in the current design when a task dispatch failed, it will go back to the task queue, and retry-retry, I think this is reasonable.\r\n> One possibly thing I think we may need to do is separate the task state `Dispatch` to `Dispatching` and `Dispatched`.\r\n\r\nthank you @ruanwenjun ,  the Pending state of the workflow instance and the dispatch failure queue are added to solve three problems:\r\n\r\n1. The status of dispatch failure is displayed to the user, no longer depends on the observation log or is unclear about the real status of the current task.\r\n2. The use of the dispatch failure queue is to avoid the high-priority header occupancy that occurred when the task queue was put back before.\r\n3. Invalid log printing that keeps looping after worker dispatch fails.\r\n\r\nbased on these three points, I think your question can be explained and is consistent with the present. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1173306356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1173310628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10257#issuecomment-1173310628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10257","id":1173310628,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5F70yk","user":{"login":"WangJPLeo","id":103574007,"node_id":"U_kgDOBixp9w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103574007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo","html_url":"https://github.com/WangJPLeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangJPLeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-04T03:54:52Z","updated_at":"2022-07-04T03:54:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > This is a good refactoring plan for me.

The audit log has made an Around aspect to all non-query/statistics APIs, and customized processing based on the current API's local method name and interaction data. After the refactoring, the processing method involving the API will be more convenient and unified, so count me in please @SbloodyS\r\n> > > > \r\n> > > > \r\n> > > > Hi @WangJPLeo May I ask whether you are working on the auditing feature currently?\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > yes, an audit log has been implemented in the project now. @EricGao888\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > @WangJPLeo Thx for the reply.

The status of dispatch failure is displayed to the user, no longer depends on the observation log or is unclear about the real status of the current task.\r\nThis is a good point, we set the status dispatching, dispatched.

The use of the dispatch failure queue is to avoid the high-priority header occupancy that occurred when the task queue was put back before.\r\n\r\nWhen we dispatch failure, the reason is that there is no worker/worker's network is broken, the correct thing is we don't consume command, although use failure queue can mitigating such problem, but this is the same solution to the current plan, put it back to the normal queue, and sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen you put it to failure queue, you need to use another thread to handle it, otherwise, you may influence the normal process.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/9955#discussion_r912302035\r\n\r\n> 3.

I think it's necessary to use another thread to address the risk handling of the failed queue and the 3 second delay. but the biggest difference between the failure queue and the current solution is, To the greatest extent, when tasks with higher priority fail, the highest priority task will not be dispatched every time, and we can do some other expansion processing for these failed tasks relying on the failure queue, like monitor and more.\r\n> \r\n> [#9955 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/9955#issuecomment-1173316182)\r\n\r\nOk, use a single thread to consume the
