I have updated and tested the code for disabling the button (basically calling appbuilder functions in the template). I don't see a need for {{ \"disabled\" if can_add }}. We can simply add it in the if condition to show the button or not. And now the backend handles the same as well. Let me know if you need further modifications in the way its implemented in this PR. I will then create another PR to do the same for some other important features like - save dashboard, download csv. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/207835144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/207835492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/298#issuecomment-207835492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/298","id":207835492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzgzNTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-09T19:06:25Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T19:06:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/5726796/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/5726796)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.04%) to 72.082% when pulling **c1c31c336ab0cabb1bcf17b4a0e473275805b5fa on sid88in:slice_permissions** into **0afa5d2cbaf1f4e009d81fe9c117f28178f3cbba on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/207835492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/207836240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/298#issuecomment-207836240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/298","id":207836240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzgzNjI0MA==","user":{"login":"sid88in","id":1587005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODcwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1587005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in","html_url":"https://github.com/sid88in","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sid88in/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-09T19:14:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T19:14:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fyi - I tried replacing appbuilder.sm.has_access('can_edit', 'SliceModelView') with can_edit and it returned false.

I can take care of the image later (I just added a feature that shows the thumbnail in the viz_type dropdown in the explroe view (https://github.com/airbnb/caravel/pull/313)). It's as simple as creating a 1024*1024 png and dropping it in `caravel/assets/images/viz_thumbnails`, with a name that matches the name of the viz_type. For the gallery there's an extra entry in `docs/gallery.rst`\n\nSo the javascript linter is aggressive and breaks the build. You can run `npm run lint` locally or look at the travis logs for the details. It also looks like landscape.io (python linter) isn't triggering anymore, I'm not sure what's up with it.
