am very concerned about this simplified solution. We should consider:\r\n- Concurrency issues, when the table metadata has been changed between reloads.

I am very concerned about this simplified solution. We should consider:\r\n> \r\n> * Concurrency issues, when the table metadata has been changed between reloads. Maybe we should only refresh the table metadata during checpoints, so we can localize, and handle changes in one place?\r\n> * Load issues, as every TaskManager with a writer task connects to the catalog, and does so periodically. This will become costly very soon. I would prioritize a centralized solution.\r\n> * The current default implementation does not solve the schema evolution problem, since that would mean on-demand table reload instead of periodic reload\r\n> \r\n> If the main goal here is to refresh the credentials, then maybe a proxy solution above the accessor could be a better solution, like the https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/standalone-metastore/metastore-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/RetryingMetaStoreClient.java where we get a new Kerberos token when the previous one has expired.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think?\r\n\r\nTo address your points:\r\n* This PR was updated so the committer will now only reload table at checkpoints. The committer was already updating the table metadata as part of the Iceberg commit and upon restart. Writers will always use the original table metadata and only use the reloaded table to get an updated FileIO, though the hope is that the writers will used the reloaded metadata in the future.\r\n* This PR was designed so that a different and more optimal table supplier solution could be plugged in later. There were limitations with the options we explored for centralized table reload, such as using the new token delegation framework or using a broadcast (I'd be happy to discuss details if you're interested). We went with this initial solution as a starting point. This feature is disabled by default and marked as experimental, so should only be used in cases where it is known that a job will not overburden the catalog with load requests.\r\n* This PR was not meant to solve schema evolution problems but rather make a change that will take a step towards that long term goal.\r\n* The short term goal for our use case was to refresh credentials, so we initially explored adding a FileIO-specific refresh. However, the long term goal is to support table reload in a running Flink job to support schema evolution. We felt that adding in the table refresh capability would be a better step towards reaching that goal, and it could also be used to solve the particular issue we are having.\r\n\r\ncc @danielcweeks @rdblue in case you have additional perspective or feedback...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1718003552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1718225533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8272#issuecomment-1718225533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8272","id":1718225533,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85magp9","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-13T19:49:44Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T19:49:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we need to discuss this more before merging it.

In my opinion we will have very specific events where we need refresh the metadata - namely, when we have a record with unexpected schema. The proposed solution does not point to this direction.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say it is random. In the committer it happens after a commit. In the writer, it happens when a writer is initialized.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I think @gaborgsomogyi and my self would be happy to discuss this problems, since the token delegation framework was designed to solve the exact same issues (Kerberos/AWS token refresh) in Flink, I think it would be good to solve the token renewal with it, if it is possible.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI have a working prototype of refreshing the table using the delegation manager. The main complication is that the manager is iniailized as part of the JM/TM initialization, not application initialization. This requires configuring the catalog for the delegation manager independently and introducing a separate configuration. It also requires the application run in the same classloader as the JM or TM. If those can be addressed then it should be easy to plug in a table supplier that reads from that instead of the catalog.\r\n\r\n> My problem is that having a solution which does not point to the right direction would make future work even harder.\r\n\r\n> As mentioned above, I think it does not point to the right direction. We need the refresh capability, but we specifically need it with a way to trigger manually. Also refreshing the whole table to get the new credentials seems problematic as well.\r\n\r\nWhich part of this do you feed is not going in the right direction? The main change is introducing an abstraction that allows a table to be refreshed, which is the first step to any solution. The actual reloading table supplier is a very small part if this.\r\n\r\nI will make a couple of changes to make the refresh more explicit, hopefully that will address your concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1719726330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1719759083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6967#issuecomment-1719759083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6967","id":1719759083,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85mgXDr","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-14T16:18:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T16:18:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhongyujiang

In my opinion we will have very specific events where we need refresh the metadata - namely, when we have a record with unexpected schema. The proposed solution does not point to this direction.\r\n> \r\n> I wouldn't say it is random. In the committer it happens after a commit. In the writer, it happens when a writer is initialized.\r\n\r\nI am fine with the commit - it was something similar already, as we had to reload the table before every commit, we just had to make sure that we do not have unexpected refresh on the table.\r\nThe writer did refresh from time-ot-time in the middle of the code before your last change.\r\n\r\n> I have a working prototype of refreshing the table using the delegation manager. The main complication is that the manager is iniailized as part of the JM/TM initialization, not application initialization. This requires configuring the catalog for the delegation manager independently and introducing a separate configuration. It also requires the application run in the same classloader as the JM or TM. If those can be addressed then it should be easy to plug in a table supplier that reads from that instead of the catalog.\r\n\r\nI think the configuration handling could be solved - I have seen similar issues solved in production\r\n\r\nThere are 2 possibilities to solve the classloader issues:\r\n- Put the provider/receiver/authentication to a plugin which are using the same JVM. This way the plugin classloader will be used for all of them. I expect the main hurdle here is to redirect the authentication to the plugin\r\n- Put everything on the main Flink classpath - this should be straightforward\r\n\r\n> Which part of this do you feed is not going in the right direction? The main change is introducing an abstraction that allows a table to be refreshed, which is the first step to any solution. The actual reloading table supplier is a very small part if this.\r\n\r\nThis opens up a way to create very bad solutions (calling central components from Tasks - DDoS-ing catalogs), and restricts the future development (we needed only schema refresh for following schema evolution of the tables, and this could be solved by using schemastore solutions. Also the schemastore could be used not only in the Iceberg sink, but in previous steps of the jobs as well, so overall it seems a much better solution than refreshing the tables)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1720983421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1721141201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8566#issuecomment-1721141201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8566","id":1721141201,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85mlofR","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-15T11:45:45Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T11:45:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/36846/ will remove around 7% of the time.

It might be something that needs to be addressed at some point.\r\n\r\nWe considered baking something into the FileIO. We felt that adding table refresh capability in the writers is already something that has been requested for a while, can provide credential and other configuration updates, and the REST API is already spec'd and available.\r\n\r\nImplemenation-wise, a centralized solution for refreshing the table metadata is ideal. The implementation here, where the subtasks perform the refresh, still is works for many cases. If it is a point of contention, we can remove the implementation (ReloadingTableSupplier) but keep the ability to set one.\r\n\r\nA FileIO-specific API for credential refresh will still add load to an Iceberg REST implementation. Table load with the REST API and refs-only snapshot mode can be fairly efficient.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1722157440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1722263748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8555#issuecomment-1722263748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8555","id":1722263748,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85mp6jE","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-16T16:22:17Z","updated_at":"2023-09-16T16:22:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Implemenation-wise, a centralized solution for refreshing the table metadata is ideal.
