For example, if we allow to use `synchronized` on a `String.intern`, the following irrelevant codes may use the same monitor `shuffleId.toString.intern`:\n\n``` scala\ndef foo(bar: Int) {\n    bar.toString.intern.synchronized {\n         ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will definitely be hard to debug and track.\n\nWhat's more, I agree with @JoshRosen and also want to see an real test on these codes to demonstrate the improvement of your modification. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50236563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50237001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1602#issuecomment-50237001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1602","id":50237001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjM3MDAx","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-26T15:22:11Z","updated_at":"2014-07-26T15:22:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50237001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50237468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1565#issuecomment-50237468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1565","id":50237468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjM3NDY4","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-26T15:38:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-26T15:38:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1565.

I think I've addressed most of your comments.  Regarding the GeneratedAggregate code, I'm happy to sit down and explain in more detail at some point.  One thing to note is that its only used in a few circumstances at the moment, and its pretty easy to switch off if we find it causes problems in the future.  That said, I think there is the possibility of pretty huge speed up here.  Here's an example that demonstrates how the rewrite happens for a simple query:\n\n`hql(\"SELECT AVG(key) + 1 FROM src GROUP BY value\")`\n\nPartial Aggregation:\n\n```\nInitial values: 0,CAST(0, LongType)\nGrouping Projection: value#25\nUpdate Expressions: if (IS NOT NULL CAST(key#24, LongType)) (currentCount#30L + 1) else currentCount#30L,Coalesce((CAST(key#24, LongType) + currentSum#31L),currentSum#31L)\nResult Projection: value#25,currentCount#30L AS PartialCount#27L,currentSum#31L AS PartialSum#26L\n```\n\nThe updates compute the new currentSum and currentCount given an update buffer joined with the input row.\n\nFinal aggregation:\n\n```\nInitial values: CAST(0, LongType),CAST(0, LongType)\nGrouping Projection: value#25\nUpdate Expressions: Coalesce((PartialSum#26L + currentSum#28L),currentSum#28L),Coalesce((PartialCount#27L + currentSum#29L),currentSum#29L)\nResult Projection: ((CAST(currentSum#28L, DoubleType) / CAST(currentSum#29L, DoubleType)) + 1.0) AS c_0#22\n```\n\nThe updates calculate the sum of the counts and partial sums.  The result divides them and adds 1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50247741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50247796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1604#issuecomment-50247796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1604","id":50247796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjQ3Nzk2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-26T20:34:03Z","updated_at":"2014-07-26T20:34:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1604:<br>\\- This patch PASSES unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/17226/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50247796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50248537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1590#issuecomment-50248537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1590","id":50248537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjQ4NTM3","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-26T21:02:02Z","updated_at":"2014-07-26T21:02:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've merged this.

IMO this design is still too complicated -- we are passing so much state to resourceOffer and it's not super clear how the different parameters are supposed to interact. What would be wrong with the following solution?\n- Add a NO_PREFS level that is after NODE_LOCAL\n- Return this as a valid locality level from the TaskSet, and make offers for this level as part of the same sequence we make offers in now\n\nThis would be a minimal change from the current code that fixes the bug. I also wouldn't try to optimize stuff as part of this patch by adding new parameters; first of all it's not clear that those things are a performance problem (many of the findTask checks are O(1)) and second any reorganization should be done as a different JIRA and PR, since the goal of this one is to just fix the bug.

After we have scheduled T1 and T2, we need to wait for 3s to check if we have NODE_LOCAL, no, then go to NO_PREFS to launch T3\n\nIn the previous discussion, we thought that this type of waiting is also unnecessary (at least, it is not there in current master branch), \n\nthe current PR ensures that NO_PREFS can only be launched after PROCESS_LOCAL and NODE_LOCAL and when these two higher prioritized ones are all consumed, we don't need to wait unnecessarily \n\nMaybe I missed some comments...I don't think I did some refactoring here? I'm rebasing the PR and adding the comments\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50253029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50253135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-50253135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":50253135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjUzMTM1","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T01:33:32Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T01:33:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1313.

@mateiz, I think ignoring bad dir is needed in production cluster.\nIn production, there is a good chance for disk failures. I always love the idea that we could replace the bad disks without service downtime. I hope this can be implemented in spark cluster.\nTo replace disks without service downtime, it require:\n1. the service is tolerant with bad dirs, which this pr did.\n2. make sure the dir is read-only or remove all permissions anybody have (chmod 000 /dir assume it's a unix-like os), so the service doesn't pick the wrong dir.\n3. replace the bad disk (modern machine supports hot plugging). mount it. bring the permissions back.\n4. service auto detect the new good dir(disk), or provide a reload api so that we can notify it.\n\nI didn't dig the code, so I don't know where `spark.local.dir` are used. But, if it's for storage, it's better to \nchoose different dirs(disks) to spread the disk IO.\n\nOk, let's go back to this behavior. @mateiz, when running spark service, one of the configured dir(disks) fails, I simple prefer ignoring the bad dir rather than bring down the entire service.\nWhat hadoop's datanode and tasktracker do is simply ignoring some bad dirs with a maximum num limit.\n\nwhat about a misconfigure? If a misconfigured directory is usable, we cannot do anything, it's uses' mistake. if the directory is bad, ignoring it isn't that bad.\n\n@YanTangZhai, I believe we should log the bad dir, so user can know there is a bad dir. And what do you think the idea of replace bad disks?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50255139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50255801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1607#issuecomment-50255801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1607","id":50255801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjU1ODAx","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T04:43:36Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T04:43:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1607.
