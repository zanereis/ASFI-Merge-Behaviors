Essentially, `rollback(commit)` should make sure that no data corresponding to that commit is used either from generated parquet files (`commit, deltacommit or compaction commit`) or from appended log files (`deltacommit`).\r\n\r\n**Scenarios**\r\n\r\n1) Rollback of an inflight commit\r\nAn inflight commit file does not contain any details about the current ingestion batch. If an ingestion batch fails during inflight, the inflight commit file has no information on what happened during that batch. All information about the batch is written at the end, after all records have been ingested. \r\n\r\n2) Rollback of a non-inflight commit\r\nAny non-inflight commit (commit, deltacommit or compaction commit) contains complete information of the ingestion batch, namely, which HoodieDataFiles and HoodieLogFiles were affected.\r\n\r\n**Solution 1** \r\n\r\n_Part 1_\r\n\r\n| CommitType |  Solution |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| COMMIT/COMPACTION |  1) Read commit metadata 2) Find parquet files corresponding to commit and delete them 3) update rollback stats 4) delete commit file 5) write a .rollback file |\r\n| DELTACOMMIT | 1) Read commit metadata 2) Find log files corresponding to base commit and write rollback blocks 3) update rollback stats 4) delete commit file 5) write a .rollback file  |\r\n| INFLIGHT | 1) Delete inflight commit file 2) write a .rollback file |\r\n\r\n_Part 2_\r\n\r\n`HoodieCompactedLogRecordScanner` implements a logic to discard all data not belonging to a safe commit. A safe commit = commit present in commitTimeline or commit < earliestCommit in timeline. To achieve this, we need to add a commitTime to each HoodieLogBlock and then during compaction (RecordReader or actual compaction) ignore the LogBlocks whose commit time is not safe.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2** \r\n\r\n_Part 1_\r\n\r\nChange the way commit metadata is written. Instead of writing metadata about the commit after ingestion, write it twice, before ingestion starts and after ingestion ends (for correctness). The metadata can be gathered from WorkLoadProfiler before the actual writing to file starts. \r\n\r\n_Part 2_\r\n\r\n| CommitType |  Solution |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| COMMIT/COMPACTION |  1) Read commit metadata 2) Find parquet files corresponding to commit and delete them 3) update rollback stats 4) delete commit file 5) write a .rollback file |\r\n| DELTACOMMIT | 1) Read commit metadata 2) Find log files corresponding to base commit and write rollback blocks 3) update rollback stats 4) delete commit file 5) write a .rollback file  |\r\n| INFLIGHT | 1) Read commit metadata 2) Perform necessary actions 3) write a .rollback file 4) delete inflight file |","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/320884338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/321046480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/235#issuecomment-321046480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/235","id":321046480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTA0NjQ4MA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T18:45:21Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T22:34:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looked into this issue, it seems like this issue is intermittently reproducible in job executions (with old build).

Typically, if you import a multi-year dataset and earlier years have way less data than current years, sorting just ensures small partitionPaths just get 1 file, while larger ones split gracefully across multiple spark partitions and get written into multiple files. \r\n\r\nof course, this comes at a cost, since sortBy needs to make a pass on the records to determine the splits.. \r\n\r\nDoes `insert()` work for you?  It already uses the custom `UpsertPartitioner` and is intended to be used for regular inserts..  `bulkInsert()` is meant for large datasets, which you can't potentially cache totally in memory to build a custom partitioner.

This sampling (reservoir sampling) is what sort already does. \r\n\r\n>due to sorting it is possible today that single output spark partition can get records from more than 1 hoodie partition and they are serialized while writing. Which can be parallelized.\r\nAgain the determination of sort splits, should ensure teh partitions are sized more evenly. Any alternate solution also need to keep this property. If these spark partitions that have data for multiple partitions are indeed the stragglers, then this hypothesis is true. I'd recommend verifying that if not done already, before going far.. \r\n\r\n>Currently I am not doing that. I will add it to future patch. \r\nI will wait for the PR. But I think we need it to be pluggable right off the bat. It does not add much effort IMO relative to the partitioner itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/322931364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/322938888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/238#issuecomment-322938888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/238","id":322938888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjkzODg4OA==","user":{"login":"ovj","id":899843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTg0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/899843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj","html_url":"https://github.com/ovj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ovj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-17T00:52:51Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T00:52:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yeah it is not possible to avoid assigning records from different hoodie partitions into single spark partition without sampling the records once.

(we can worry about MOR eventually) . But Copy-on-write alone is not much code\r\n\r\n```\r\n [hoodie-hadoop-mr]$ grep -R \"import parquet\" . | awk -F':' ' { print $1 } ' | uniq -c \r\n   6 ./src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hadoop/HoodieInputFormat.java\r\n   3 ./src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hadoop/realtime/HoodieRealtimeRecordReader.java\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- For `hoodie-hive` module, we can add a new `--hive2` flag, that chooses inputformat based on this. \r\n\r\n```\r\n[hoodie-hive]$ gr \"import parquet\" . | awk -F':' ' { print $1 } ' | uniq -c \r\n   1 ./src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hive/HiveSyncTool.java\r\n   4 ./src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hive/HoodieHiveClient.java\r\n   1 ./src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hive/SchemaDifference.java\r\n   6 ./src/main/java/com/uber/hoodie/hive/util/SchemaUtil.java\r\n   3 ./src/test/java/com/uber/hoodie/hive/HiveSyncToolTest.java\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemaining changes are bit more tricky, but generally lends to subclassing and interfaces.. for e.g, HoodieHiveClient can be extended by a HoodieHive2Client... \r\n\r\nDo you want to take a stab at this?

(i,e a simple check to ensure queries wait enough time for files to show up)\r\n- A longer term fix here, could be building out the Hoodie Timeline server tier, that mostly @prazanna and I have discussed amongst ourselves.

The workload profile metadata in the inflight however, has information about all log files that should've been updated.\r\n\r\n5. rollback(inflight) -> Reads metadata from workload profile about ALL log files and writes rollback blocks to them. Now we have a scenario with a log file with an extra rollback block (since the upsert never succeeded for that log file).\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nAdd metadata to log-blocks, more specifically an `instantTime` to every logBlock and a `targetInstantTime` to the RollBack block. Now, when the `HoodieCompactedLogRecordScanner` performs rollback, check if the `targetInstantTime` of the Rollback block is the same as `instantTime` of previous block being rolled back. \r\n\r\n**Thoughts**\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to evolve metadata for logBlocks (say we want to add something more), should we have a evolving schema for metadata ?

HoodieCompactedLogRecordScanner merges blocks only for a specific log file version and not across log files version (for the same log file ofcourse), so the rollback block written in the next log version will miss to rollback the block written in the previous log version.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nMerge log blocks across versions, this requires some changes in `HoodieCompactedLogRecordScanner` and `HoodieRealtimeTableCompactor`\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/329847102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/329850144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/40#issuecomment-329850144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/40","id":329850144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTg1MDE0NA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-15T17:41:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T17:41:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I actually thought these checks were already there.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I agree with high level approach above, but want to concisely summarize the correctness criteria there. \r\n\r\n> Reader will continue to read and merge the records in all log versions, starting with first log version till it either (a) hits EOF on last log version or  (b) encountered a data block with instant time > latest instant time on timeline.
