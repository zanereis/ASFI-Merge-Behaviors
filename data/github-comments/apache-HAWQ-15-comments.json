The command specified in your writable external table definition is executed by all segments in the Greenplum system, whether or not a segment has output rows to process or not.\n\nWhile your command \"hawq register ...\" does nothing about streaming row records but change the native table's file path, so it's not comparable to this DDL's usage.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/222788725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/comments/222867566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hawq/pull/679#issuecomment-222867566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hawq/issues/679","id":222867566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjg2NzU2Ng==","user":{"login":"changleicn","id":6935081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzUwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6935081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn","html_url":"https://github.com/changleicn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changleicn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T01:20:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T01:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Had a offline discussion with @GodenYao.
