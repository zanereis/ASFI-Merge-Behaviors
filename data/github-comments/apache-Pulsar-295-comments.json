The `duplicates` mode works this way (see docs below). It was the original mode it worked on by default but it is not really effective in the \"high strain\" situation as it turned out, and that's why I introduced `allDuplicates`.\r\n\r\nWhy this is not a good idea to use `duplicates` while we are having the \"high queue strain\" problem? \r\n\r\nBecause of the way how workflows are queued. The `allDuplicates` mode have been introduced precisely to tackle the \"high queue strain\" problem. Problem with using the action is that it has to actually start running to cancel anything. And if you have a \"strain\" on the GitHub Action Queue, your \"cancel\" workflow might simply be queued for hours because other jobs will occupy the queue. So the past \"duplicates\" from the same branch will not be cancelled effectively because the job to cancel them will only run hours later after those duplicates have finished.\r\n\r\nIf we really want to be \"queue conscious\", I honestly cannot imagine a situation where you would like to wait for previous build from the same branch to complete when you already have a new one queued. Yeah you will see the result later, but there is probably a reason why you pushed new changes to that branch and what you are really interested in eventually is to see the results of the build for the \"newest\" commit in that branch, not the previous ones. And yeah - it means that you might see some partial results of it later, but this is what I consider as being \"nice\" to others. When you push new version of the same PR, cancelling any (even already running) version of that PR is simply a very nice gesture for the others, because you will anyhow have to look at the result of the newer commits. \r\n\r\nThat's why the `allDuplicates` is much better approach IMHO. It is more aggressive, yes, but also it is much more efficient. Whenever ANY cancel jobs will run, it will cancel ALL duplicates from ALL branches there - therefore it makes all people who push more than one change successively pushing changes to their PRs to ONLY use the job time for the last version of the commit they pushed (in the \"strain\" situation). I think this is really the best way to proceed.\r\n\r\nHere, relevant part from the original documentation from https://github.com/potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs\r\n\r\nThe job cancel modes work as follows:\r\nCancel Mode | No sourceRunId specified | The sourceRunId set to ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nduplicates | Cancels duplicate runs from the same repo/branch as current run. | Cancels duplicate runs for the same repo/branch as the source run.\r\nallDuplicates | Cancels duplicate runs from all running workflows. | Cancels duplicate runs from all running workflows.\r\nself | Cancels self run. | Cancel the sourceRunId run.\r\nfailedJobs | Cancels all runs of own workflow that have matching jobs that failed. | Cancels all runs of the sourceRunId workflow that have matching jobs that failed.\r\nnamedJobs | Cancels all runs of own workflow that have matching jobs. | Cancels all runs of the sourceRunId workflow that have matching jobs.\r\nallDuplicatedNamedJobs | Cancels all duplicate runs of own workflow that share matching jobs pattern. | Cancels all runs of the sourceRunId workflow that share matching job pattern.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/773985961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/773991347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9342#issuecomment-773991347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9342","id":773991347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3Mzk5MTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"BewareMyPower","id":18204803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA0ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18204803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower","html_url":"https://github.com/BewareMyPower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BewareMyPower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-05T12:01:42Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T12:01:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Now

Checking the pulsar-client-admin jar, I see that its protobuf dependency (and others) are included inside and their packages are not [shaded / relocated.](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/class-relocation.html) This caused Eclipse to see the protobuf classes included in the pulsar-client-admin jar rather than the incompatible ones from the protobuf dependency I had defined in my pom.xml, hence the compilation error in my code.\r\n\r\nSwitching to the pulsar-client-admin-original / pulsar-client-original packages fixes my problem since this allows Maven to resolve dependencies as expected rather than running into \"surprise dependencies\" hidden away inside the pulsar jar.\r\n\r\nMaybe pulsar should relocate the packages of its dependencies, or maybe the \"original\" version should be mentioned in the documentation.

But if the CI checks are in the pending queue, the cancel workflow will not be working, correct?\r\n\r\nIt will cancel all scheduled 'duplicate' workflows that are in \"running\" and \"queued\" (or \"pending\" state).\r\n\r\n> For example, I have a PR A has two commits C1, and C2. If the CI checks of both C1 and C2 are pending in the queue, then it will run C1 at first and then run C2. In this situation, it looks like the cancel workflow is not working anymore.\r\n\r\nYes it will work. Just to give you a more complete (and complex) example (also showing the reasons why you have duplicates usually). \r\n\r\nYou have several different people submitting PR1, PR2 from their forks, and a committer pushing branch 'branch-A\" directly to your repository.  Imagine that people pushed several commits in quick succession for all of those. This usually happen when you realized that there is one more change needed or when you iteratively work on your PR. It hp  Usually it is either a \"--force-push\" commit replacing the previous ones or \"--fixup commit\". It works the same in both cases but this is a \"natural\" way people work. For example for many people it is far easier to review whole extent of your change in GitHub (they are used to doing PR reviews there) so they push the change as PR, review it there themselves and realize they need one more line to be removed (and they add --fixup and push again). \r\n\r\nSo coming back to my example. Imagine you have high strain situation. All your PRs generated 10 or so workflows (that's how Pulsar works - produces many workflows per PR). But let's assume we have two \"real\" worklfows \"w1\" and \"w2\" and the \"cancel\" workflow I added \"c\". So initially all of the workflows generated are in \"Pending\" state. assume each of the PRs has been pushed twice - first Commit 1 (C1) and then fixup Commit 2 (C2). So all C1s are 'older' duplicates of C2. \r\n \r\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\r\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | \r\n\r\nThen imagine that PR1 \"standard\" worflows started to run for C1. So they change state to 'running'\r\n\r\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\r\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | running | running | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n\r\nSo far so good. Then the \"cancel workflow\"  starts running for C1 commit in PR1.\r\n\r\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\r\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | running | running | running | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| PR2      | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| branch-A | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n\r\nThe \"cancel\" workflow with \"allDuplicates\" mode is \"aggressive\". It will look for ANY duplicates in ANY PRs/Branches (including the Pending ones) and cancels them. So what happens next it will set all C1 runs to cancelled state (no matter if they were Pending or running):\r\n\r\n\r\n|          | w1-C1   | w2-C1   | c-C1    | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\r\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | cancelling | cancelling | complete | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| PR2      | cancelling | cancelling | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| branch-A | cancelling | cancelling | pending | pending | pending | pending |\r\n\r\nThose runs will be quickly canceled and job slots from the \"Running\" ones will be freed for next runs so likely some of the Pending C2 runs from PR1 will be quickly \"Running:\r\n\r\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2   | w2-C2   | c-C2    |\r\n|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | complete | running | running | pending |\r\n| PR2      | pending  | pending | pending | pending |\r\n| branch-A | pending  | pending | pending | pending |\r\n\r\nNow - the \"cancel\" workflows are not cancelled themselves. They will continue running, but they are very quick usually and any \"cancel workflow\" run next will see there are no duplicates and will complete quickly leaving the \"slot\" for \"real\" workflows of the latest commits (C2) to run - hopefully more slots are available then and your C2 workflows start running after that:\r\n\r\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |\r\n| PR2      | complete | running  | running  | pending  |\r\n| branch-A | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending  |\r\n\r\nHower if the committer again pushes THIRD commit C3 to branch-A in the meantime, the (so far pending) cancel workflows will again prove to be useful. Let's say PR2's \"cancel workflow\" for C2 runs after the new commit has been added by the commiyter:\r\n\r\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |\r\n| PR2      | complete | complete | running  | running  |         |         |         |\r\n| branch-A | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending  | pending | pending | pending |\r\n\r\nThe PR2's c-C2 workflow (or even branch-As, c-C1 workflow if the PR2's one managed to run already) will find that there is a duplicate in `branch-A` and it will cancel those:\r\n\r\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |\r\n| PR2      | complete | complete | complete  | complete  |         |         |         |\r\n| branch-A | complete  | cancelled  | cancelled  | running  | running | running | pending |\r\n\r\nAgain the remaining \"cancel\" workflow (branch A's c-C2 an c-C3) complete quickly and do nothing as there are no duplicates, freeing the slot for \"regular\" workflows:\r\n\r\n|          | c-C1     | w1-C2    | w2-C2    | c-C2     | w1-C3   | w2-C3   | c-C3    |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| PR1      | complete | complete | complete | complete |         |         |         |\r\n| PR2      | complete | complete | complete  | complete  |         |         |         |\r\n| branch-A | complete  | cancelled  | cancelled  | complete  | running | running | complete |\r\n\r\nEffectively what we get is that the \"duplicates\" will be cancelled frequently enough (as often as ANY \"cancel\" workflow from  ANY commit from ANY branch manages to get into \"running\" state) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/774644408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/774647756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9519#issuecomment-774647756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9519","id":774647756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDY0Nzc1Ng==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-07T10:14:21Z","updated_at":"2021-02-07T10:14:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xche Thanks a lot for the help on this issue.

It's a bug in https://github.com/apache/pulsar-test-infra/blob/master/diff-only/entrypoint.sh . \r\nThe diff-only solution doesn't work well together with shallow clones. Because of performance and efficiency, the Pulsar workflows use a shallow clone of last 25 commits. That doesn't work together with diff-only solution when there are more than 25 commits in the PR. \r\nThis must be fixed asap. However, the diff-only solution is not necessary at all. There's a \"paths-ignore\" feature in GitHub Actions that makes the diff-only solution obsolete.

dug into this a bit more this morning, and it's interesting to point out that there are two fundamental differences between the system I am running tests on (macOS, or non linux) and @lhotari's system, which is linux. I'm guessing the `Azure VM` @lhotari references above is a linux machine, but it'd be good to confirm. This _might_ explain some of the differences we're seeing regarding reproducibility. The following conditional block determines the way a broker calculates cpu (and all other) host usage:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/7c68ade453136895d19fa4723351d26256f3d624/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/tools/LoadReportCommand.java#L94-L102\r\n\r\nI plan to take a look at the `LinuxBrokerHostUsageImpl` class later. I wonder if there is a bug in that code because we saw that `Infinity` value for CPU usage in the logs above. I'm guessing we're dividing by 0 in some rare edge case.\r\n\r\nThere could certainly be an issue in the `GenericBrokerHostUsageImpl` class, too, but it seems to me that we're more consistently reproducing the problem in the linux version, so that's where I'll look at the linux class next.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that neither of these Usage classes are explicitly tested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/775287323/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/775326486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9242#issuecomment-775326486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9242","id":775326486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTMyNjQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"joncashe","id":625772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe","html_url":"https://github.com/joncashe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joncashe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-08T17:51:15Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T17:51:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Yes, the broker logs could help us to find more Infomation.\r\n> \r\n> And I have some questions, please take a look.\r\n> \r\n> 1.
