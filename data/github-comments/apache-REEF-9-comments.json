Are we using Resource as a generic term for what in Yarn would be called a Container? It seems Resource is used fairly consistently (e.g. a ResourceStatusEvent maps to the status of a single Yarn Container). However, `RuntimeStatusEvent` uses the term Container -- is this usage a mistake and should be changed to Resource?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/93758605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/93759952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/147#issuecomment-93759952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/147","id":93759952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzNzU5OTUy","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-16T15:13:19Z","updated_at":"2015-04-16T15:13:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This also updates the snapshot from 11 to 92.
