We discussed your proposal and here are our thoughts.\r\n\r\n- Making no changes to the file paths and relying on `FileIO` implementations to internally interpret them differently can cause confusion since the same path could mean totally different locations based on the underlying implementation. \r\n\r\nWith our approach, \r\n- The path we see in metadata files is the path that gets acted upon. We feel this is cleaner and causes less confusion.\r\n- Further, when we use relative paths, they will always be relative to the table. This invariant makes it easier to interpret the paths.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, we prefer the approach laid out in the design doc. We understand the concerns around Iceberg spec with v2 format already changing a lot. We are open to ideas on shipping this with the least interference (even if it means we wait till v2 gets out). \r\n\r\nPlease let us know your thoughts.

@zhijiangW @rkhachatryan  @pnowojski @kl0u @zentol @aljoscha \r\n\r\nI think it is a bug of Flink and was introduced in [FLINK-14228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14228)(apache/flink#9854, apache/flink#10151). The changes for [FLINK-14228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14228) rely on `StreamTask.afterInvoke`  and `OperatorChain.closeOperators` will only be invoked after **end of input**. But that is not true after [FLIP-34: Terminate/Suspend Job with Savepoint ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/JAglBg) long before. Task could enter a **finished** state after synchronous savepoint, that is an expected job suspension and stopping. I am also aware of [FLIP-147: Support Checkpoints After Tasks Finished](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/mw-ZCQ), I think maybe the three should make agreement on terminologies.\r\n\r\nBesides, I think FLIP-27 Source does not work with synchronous savepoint. @becketqin @StephanEwen\r\n\r\nI have pushed branch [synchronous-savepoint-conflict-with-bounded-end-input-case](https://github.com/kezhuw/flink/commits/synchronous-savepoint-conflict-with-bounded-end-input-case) in my local repository. Two test cases failed both:\r\n* `SavepointITCase.testStopSavepointWithBoundedInput` failed due to `BoundedOneInput.endInput` called.\r\n* `SavepointITCase.testStopSavepointWithFlip27Source` failed due to timeout.\r\n\r\nFLINK-14228: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14228\r\nFLIP-34: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/JAglBg\r\nFLIP-147: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/mw-ZCQ\r\n`StreamTask.finishTask`: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/d20867a58d8f9ba7520d611d5fab01e6f98253a5/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/runtime/tasks/StreamTask.java#L467","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/766096422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/766143674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2079#issuecomment-766143674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2079","id":766143674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NjE0MzY3NA==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-23T17:16:02Z","updated_at":"2021-01-23T17:16:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@holdenk, could you elaborate a bit more on the idea?

The timestamp value represents an absolute point in time.  So it's more like `LocalDateTime`. Why can't  Iceberg expose `timestamp without timezone` as Spark `timestamp`?\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand the problem is that Spark has only one timestamp type but Iceberg has two types which causes some inconsistency in type mapping between Spark and Iceberg.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it could be solved in a following way:\r\n1. For read access there is no problem, both Iceberg types (`timestamp`, `timestamptz`) could be exposed as Spark `timestamp`.\r\n2. For insert there is no problem because we know target type defined in the table metadata and can choose correct one\r\n3. For table creation we have inconsistency which could be solved by configuration property. Spark has such kind of property to choose how to store timestamp fields in parquet (`spark.sql.parquet.outputTimestampType=(INT96 | TIMESTAMP_MICROS | TIMESTAMP_MILLIS)`). Why can't we have such logic for Iceberg?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/767443068/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/767690073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2151#issuecomment-767690073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2151","id":767690073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NzY5MDA3Mw==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-26T17:10:35Z","updated_at":"2021-01-26T17:10:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@marton-bod, @lcspinter: Would you please take a look?\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/767690073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/767698123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2119#issuecomment-767698123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2119","id":767698123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NzY5ODEyMw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-26T17:23:33Z","updated_at":"2021-01-26T17:23:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Could we add some tests for this code path?
