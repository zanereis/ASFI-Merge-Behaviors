only and `en0` is both ipv4 and ipv6 available. However the JVM selects `awdl0` as the default Network Interface in `java.net.DefaultInterface#getDefault()` method.  So if we use a ipv4 address for multicasting, the error will occur.\r\n\r\nIf `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true` is specified, JVM will avoid choosing `awdl0` as default network interface. So everything will be all right.\r\n\r\n### Enhancement\r\n\r\nBasically we don't want to let user to specify that vm args manually, so I'd like to propose to automatically select network interface by the input multicast address.\r\n\r\nIf the multicast address is ipv4 address, automatically use ipv4 network address (by calling `java.net.MulticastSocket#setInterface()`), and vise versa.\r\n \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/417903024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/417907180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/2409#issuecomment-417907180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2409","id":417907180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzkwNzE4MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-02T05:56:09Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T09:07:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2409](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/commit/9135546c847edb3eb6d8abd3efd46f9ab702bd2e?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=VnEIkiFQT0&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #2409      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     55.02%   54.99%   -0.03%     \n  Complexity     5279     5279              \n============================================\n  Files           573      573              \n  Lines         25490    25490              \n  Branches       4526     4526              \n============================================\n- Hits          14026    14019       -7     \n- Misses         9372     9375       +3     \n- Partials       2092     2096       +4\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [...ache/dubbo/remoting/p2p/support/AbstractGroup.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZHViYm8tcmVtb3RpbmcvZHViYm8tcmVtb3RpbmctcDJwL3NyYy9tYWluL2phdmEvb3JnL2FwYWNoZS9kdWJiby9yZW1vdGluZy9wMnAvc3VwcG9ydC9BYnN0cmFjdEdyb3VwLmphdmE=) | `45.45% <0%> (-11.37%)` | `7% <0%> (-1%)` | |\n| [...bo/remoting/transport/netty/NettyCodecAdapter.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZHViYm8tcmVtb3RpbmcvZHViYm8tcmVtb3RpbmctbmV0dHkvc3JjL21haW4vamF2YS9vcmcvYXBhY2hlL2R1YmJvL3JlbW90aW5nL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9uZXR0eS9OZXR0eUNvZGVjQWRhcHRlci5qYXZh) | `53.12% <0%> (-1.57%)` | `3% <0%> (ø)` | |\n| [...pache/dubbo/registry/support/AbstractRegistry.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZHViYm8tcmVnaXN0cnkvZHViYm8tcmVnaXN0cnktYXBpL3NyYy9tYWluL2phdmEvb3JnL2FwYWNoZS9kdWJiby9yZWdpc3RyeS9zdXBwb3J0L0Fic3RyYWN0UmVnaXN0cnkuamF2YQ==) | `68.16% <0%> (-0.38%)` | `64% <0%> (+2%)` | |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-dubbo/pull/2409?src=pr&el=footer).
