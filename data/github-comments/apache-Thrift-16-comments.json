The symptom is that notifyAll() isn't waking up all the threads it is supposed to.  It seems to wake up about 64 threads before it gives up.  If you run blockTest by itself (comment out the other thread-manager tests in Tests.cpp) it will wait 1 out of 2 times, and if you look at things in the debugger you will see a bunch of threads blocking on blockMonitor_ waiting for the notification from the test thread.

The tests were even using this pattern.\n\nI see that you have added a PosixThreadFactory ctor that lets you set the detached state in a portable way, and that's great.  It doesn't change that this pattern is already out there in a lot of production code.  It even broke tests which made no use of ThreadManager.\n\nIf you need to fix the tests after making a change, chances are high that you have introduced a source breaking change that needs to be strongly considered.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/254233330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/254240871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1103#issuecomment-254240871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1103","id":254240871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDI0MDg3MQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T15:26:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T15:26:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What you described is a failing in the original set of thread factories to provide common functionality (detached, policy, priority) in the base class.  Only PosixThreadFactory has policy and priority, and yet it's quite likely that all of them would benefit from these.  I moved the detached information into the base class as a first step.  I could certainly add back setDetached into the base and mark it deprecated, however that breaks the contract that the servers require - that the detached disposition cannot change while the server is running, so it really doesn't belong... I still have no valid use case for changing detached disposition of a thread manager while it is in use.\n\nNow that said, I believe that Thread knows if it is detached or not; if Thread had a \"joinIfJoinable()\" method then that server requirement would go away since the TConnectedClient could just call that and it would do the right thing, and setDetached() could be added back in avoiding that particular breaking change.\n\nI don't find breaking changes to be a problem when they remove behavior that has no use case to support it, however.  There's a lot of technical debt in the concurrency area that still could be addressed - this was a first pass as trying to shore it up and ensure functions provided are actually tested and work, and that tests don't take 100 seconds each.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/254240871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/254249129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1103#issuecomment-254249129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1103","id":254249129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDI0OTEyOQ==","user":{"login":"ben-craig","id":923910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMzkxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/923910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig","html_url":"https://github.com/ben-craig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ben-craig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T15:54:15Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T15:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm fine with you adding back setDetached and marking it deprecated.

Short version of why is that those parameters are always mutually exclusive, and there's no really good way to have a non-optional return or throw pattern for async.\nWith the `TAsyncResult<T>`, non-optional return values are encapsulated within a throwing func in the enum, such that you can handle your do/catch block in a callback.  Consider the following example:\n\n``` swift\n/// normal: public func hello() throws -> String\ndo {\n  let world = try hello()\n} catch let e { handle(e) }\n\n/// old async:     public func hello(completion: @escaping (String?, Error?) -> Void) throws\ndo {\n  try hello() {\n    guard let world = $0 else {\n      if let e = $1 { handle(e) }\n    }\n  }\n} catch let e { handle(e) }\n\n/// new async:   public func hello(completion: @escaping (TAsyncResult<String>) -> Void)\nhello() {\n  do {\n     let world = try $0.value()\n  catch let e { handle(e) }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a big improvement over the existing
