To sum up the updated facilities:\r\n- Aggregate Readers\r\n  - `IAggregateReader`: add three interface methods\r\n    - `hasNextChunk`\r\n    - `nextChunkMeta`\r\n    - `hasNextPageInCurrentChunk`\r\n  - Readers which implement `IAggregateReader` are thus updated:\r\n    - `MemChunkReader`\r\n    - `FileSeriesReaderAdapter`\r\n    - `IterateReader`\r\n  - `FileSeriesReader` in the TsFile module is updated.\r\n- Aggregate Functions\r\n  - `AggregateFunction`: add an abstract method `calculateValueFromChunkMetaData`\r\n  - Functions which extend `AggregateFunction` are thus updated:\r\n    - `AvgAggrFunc`\r\n    - `CountAggrFunc`\r\n    - `MaxValueAggrFunc`\r\n    - `MinValueAggrFunc`\r\n    - `FirstValueAggrFunc`\r\n    - `LastValueAggrFunc`\r\n    - `MaxTimeAggrFunc`\r\n    - `MinTimeAggrFunc`\r\n- Aggregate Engine Executor\r\n  - `AggregateEngineExecutor.aggregateWithoutValueFilter` method is modified\r\n  - `AggregateEngineExecutor.handleLastMaxTimeWithOutTimeGenerator` method is modified\r\n\r\nIt looks good to me.

We are fortunate to find this `Local` problem in ITCase, but we cannot rule out that there are unpredictable problems hidden in other places, so I think would be better make a util similar with `String.format` in IoTDB , and set the configuration we need in the util, such as `Local` information, so that even if other problems are found in the future, we can fix it as a whole by modifying one place.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think? @JulianFeinauer @jixuan1989\r\n\r\nI  think many String.format() is used for log.
