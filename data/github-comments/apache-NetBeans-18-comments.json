It is another license update. The first commit is just whitespace cleanup and update of the license for the entity definitions. I think with the clarification, that the W3C considers the files to be distributed under the W3 software license we should be safe.\r\n\r\nThe maven.coverage situation is a bit different. These files are not from the W3C and IMHO the license statement referring to ISO is bogus in this case. The important thing is, that the cobertura DTDs don't define entities, so you can actually completely parse a coverage report from cobertura without accessing the DTDs, you just can't verify the files. As the DTDs are not necessary and the license situation is unnclear, I modified the module to use a non-validating parser. I manually checked, that the code coverage support in the IDE works before and after the change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/400783640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/400845348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/607#issuecomment-400845348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/607","id":400845348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDg0NTM0OA==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T22:10:22Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T22:10:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Probably, in this case, we should not squash & merge because it would be big one commit and it would be hard to find specified changes...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/400845348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/400860290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/603#issuecomment-400860290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/603","id":400860290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDg2MDI5MA==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T23:21:11Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T23:21:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can test that.
