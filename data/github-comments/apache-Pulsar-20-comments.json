This would make the consumer use an `ArrayBlockingQueue` I don't know if this makes sense for partitioned topics because we use `incomingMessages.put` to insert messages in the queue, this would block almost every time for every partition delivering a message. If we remove the usage of `ArrayBlockingQueue` in `PartitionedConsumerImpl` we could change `incomingMessages.put` to `.add` and guard it with the write lock instead of read lock.~~\r\nJust realised that `PartitionedConsumerImpl` always uses at least the number of partitions as its queue size, this means that it almost always should have `receiveQueueSize >

, Thanks for the info.  Excuse me for not expressing well.  \r\nRegarding add an option in the broker config to run bookie together,   My concern is like this:\r\n\r\ncurrently, command `PulsarBrokerStarter` is called as this:\r\n``` \r\n$ PulsarBrokerStarter $DEFAULT_BROKER_CONF\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we set an option runBookieTogether in `broker.conf`, the command to run bookie together would be something like:\r\n``` \r\n$ PulsarBrokerStarter $DEFAULT_BROKER_CONF $DEFAULT_BOOKKEEPER_CONF\r\n```\r\nIn this way, both the broker.conf and command (PulsarBrokerStarter usage) need change. \r\nSince we may have to change the command(to add a new config file for bookie), so changed to using purely command line options maybe better.\r\n\r\nThe code in this code review, will provide a command like this:\r\n``` \r\n$ PulsarBrokerStarter $DEFAULT_BROKER_CONF [--run-bookie] [--run-bookie-autorecovery] [ --bookie-conf $DEFAULT_BOOKKEEPER_CONF]\r\n```\r\nIf we also provide a option in broker.conf, Does that mean `[--run-bookie]` and `[--run-bookie-autorecovery]` could be set through cli and also broker.conf?\r\nIf that is it, it may be confusing under some condition, like user set `not run-bookie` in broker.conf, but   set `run bookie` through cli.

few thoughts:\r\n\r\n- There can be binary BC concerns for existing 0.1.x pulsar users. However I think the new interface enforces type information and can easily support existing producers with an identical codec: `byte[] -> byte[]`. It might be worthing breaking binary BC for 0.2.x pulsar releases.\r\n\r\n- I think `PulsarClient` doesn't have to be typed. The type information is associated with topics, and can be enforced at Producers and Consumers. You can do followings:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface PulsarClient {\r\n\r\n<T> Producer<T> createProducer(..., Codec<T> codec);\r\n\r\n<T> Consumer<T> createConsumer(..., Codec<T> codec);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- I think `Codec<T>` can be more gc-friendly with ByteBuf and InputStream.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface Codec<T> {\r\n\r\nbyte[] encode(T value);\r\n\r\nT decode(byte[] bytes);\r\n\r\nByteBuf encodeBuf(T value);\r\n\r\nT decodeBuf(ByteBuf buffer);\r\n\r\nvoid encode(T value, OutputStream os);\r\n\r\nT decode(InputStream
