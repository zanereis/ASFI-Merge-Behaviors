I know understand the problem that we effectively introduce via `RpcEndpoint.runAsync` another message which might get \"lost\" (e.g. due to OOM exception).\r\n\r\nI agree with Stephan that it's hard to reason about the consistency of the `AkkaRpcActor\r\ns` internal state once we see an exception. The conservative approach would probably be to let it terminate or calling `notifyFatalError` to handle it.\r\n\r\nRelated to this is also how we handle exceptions in the `AkkaRpcActor.handleRpcInvocation`. There we catch all exception and simply send them to the caller. I think in this method we should only send the non-fatal exceptions back and terminate otherwise.\r\n\r\nTo follow a similar pattern for the `handleRunAsync` we could think about returning a `Future` which we return when calling `RpcEndpoint.runAsync` which will be completed with non fatal exceptions or if the `Runnable` has been executed. And in case that we see a fatal exception we terminate or call `notifyFatalError`.

And this `Future` should be set as a field in `RunAsync` in order to get it when handle in `AkkaRpcActor`. The `Future` can help to determine whether the message is executed successfully or lost to enhance the `Tell` mechanism.  If the `Future` with `Tell` action is better than current `RpcEndpoint` .callAsync** which refers to `Ask` action, I will try to do for that. Or another option is just tolerating the lost message in current `RpcEndpoint.runAsync`, and it should be used in such scenarios for efficiency and not safe. For the important interaction, it should resort to `RpcEndpoint.callAsync`.

There is a big benefit to having them immutable, both for safety against accidental bugs, and also from a concurrency standpoint. Regular mutable non-volatile variables have visibility problems in concurrent access, which leads to very subtle bugs that are hard to trace and recover: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility\r\n\r\nFor `Execution`, I would change it such that the `ExecutionVertex` swaps the current `Execution` (in state `RECONCILING`) with the a new `Execution` that has all the fields properly set. That way there is a quasi atomic replacement of the previous execution, which is safer and easier to reason about.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth to even create the JobManager (from the JobManagerRunner) and the ExecutionGraph directly in reconciliation mode. That way, you don't have to worry what to do with TaskManagers that register while the JobMaster has not yet switched to reconciliation.\r\n\r\nCan you explain a bit why the reconciliation need the two phases:\r\n  1. Receive reports, set the execution attempt and state\r\n  2. Once all are there, transition the state to running\r\n\r\nCould it be done such that on report the `Execution` is directly set to the reported state? Then once all reports are there, everything is just fine. After the reconciliation timeout expires, you would just iterate over all executions and `fail()` the ones that are still in `RECONCILE` - recovery logic takes care of the rest.\r\nThat may also handle the case where some already reconciled tasks fail while reconciliation still happens. The ExecutionGraph would already recover the local tasks that are affected by the failure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/282371081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/282384830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2987#issuecomment-282384830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2987","id":282384830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjM4NDgzMA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T19:39:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T19:39:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mushketyk what do you think of refactoring `GraphCsvReader` and `BipartiteGraphCsvReader` to use configuration objects using the builder patter?

on `master`.\r\n\r\nNote about changes to partition assignment logic in deleted lines 538 - 553 and added lines 563 -565 of `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase`:\r\nThe change is irrelevant to this issue, but something I stumbled across when touching that part of the code. Problems:\r\n\r\n1. The `KafkaConsumerPartitionAssignmentTest` was testing a no-longer used `assignPartitions` method, so the tests actually never covered the actual behaviour.\r\n\r\n2. Previously, the partition assignment was changed from using the \"modulo on KafkaTopicPartition hashes\" approach to \"pre-sorting the partition list and round-robin assigning\". This change should actually breaks the tests in `KafkaConsumerPartitionAssignmentTest`, but didn't because as mentioned above, the tests were testing an unused method. The current approach will also be problematic for dynamically growing subscribed partition lists, because the sorting order will change as the list grows with newly discovered partitions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/282693220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/282707799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3334#issuecomment-282707799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3334","id":282707799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjcwNzc5OQ==","user":{"login":"ramkrish86","id":3690658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTA2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3690658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86","html_url":"https://github.com/ramkrish86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T12:34:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T12:34:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen - Ping for initial reviews.
