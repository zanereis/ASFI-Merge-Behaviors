What I'm not sure about is how to pass a path as an identifier. Supporting a namespace element that has the file format is useful for imports, but not for the `IcebergSource` because I don't think that we want the source to support those identifiers.\r\n\r\nFor table imports, I think we have more options because we're controlling the parsed statement or the stored procedure. That procedure could use optional arguments like `file_format` or `location`. Similarly, a parsed statement can be transformed with rules to pass the reference as something other than an `Identifier`. What is relevant here is that we have options for those cases, so I think we should focus in this PR on how to pass paths from `IcebergSource` to a catalog, and loading in that catalog.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Spark, the identifier is immediately used to load the table, or is added to a CTAS plan. I don't think that the identifier is modified after it is returned. We could use a custom `Identifier` implementation, `PathIdentifier`, to signal that a path should be loaded.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class PathIdentifier implements Identifier {\r\n  private final String location;\r\n  private final String name;\r\n\r\n  public PathIdentifier(String location) {\r\n    this.location = location;\r\n    this.name = Iterables.getLastElement(Splitter.on(\"/\").splitToList(location));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String location() {\r\n    return location;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String namespace() {\r\n    return new String[] { location };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String name() {\r\n    return name;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses the last part of the location string as the table name, so that the default subquery aliases added in Spark work.\r\n\r\nThen each method in `SparkCatalog` would just need to check `instanceof PathIdentifier`, which is a bit cleaner than the `/` check -- although that would still need to be done in `IcebergSource`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/736749862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/736757912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1853#issuecomment-736757912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1853","id":736757912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjc1NzkxMg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-01T19:08:33Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T19:08:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the updates!

It may be that we have been talking about different parts of the problem.\r\n\r\nTo me, there are two main approaches:\r\n\r\n* **Cherry-pick commits**: A transaction would keep track of different table metadata files without updating each table's metadata location. When it is time to commit, swap the locations in one atomic operation. If there is a conflict, then refresh that table, cherry-pick the commits since the base metadata file, and retry with the new metadata location.\r\n* **Retry pending updates**: A transaction would keep track of all `PendingUpdate` instances that were created to modify the tables. These can already refresh and retry the individual operation's changes. The initial writes would configure and commit each change to a transaction. The transaction would perform the atomic swap of multiple locations. If there is a conflict, then refresh each table and re-commit the changes to it (just like single-table transactions). Then retry the atomic swap.\r\n\r\nI was expecting an API that used the second approach. That's what I see as the major problem to solve: how to coordinate operations across multiple tables in a way that allows the existing `PendingUpdate` retries, like an extension of the single-table transaction API.\r\n\r\nI think that keeping each configured `PendingUpdate` around is going to be an easier way to retry because the logic for retries is already written. Trying to cherry-pick changes means needing to know much more information than is tracked currently, and would require reproducing all of the changes from metadata and applying them.\r\n\r\nI think a normal operation example is helpful:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDELETE FROM db.table WHERE id = 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's say that only replaces one file: delete `file_a.parquet`, add `file_b.parquet`. But it will also validate that no data has been added that could match the `WHERE` clause since the operation started, because it needs to scan the table to find where the records are located.\r\n\r\nFor the cherry-pick approach, we can recover the deleted file, the added file, and the parent snapshot ID. But we can't recover the filter from the `WHERE` clause, nor do we know whether the validation was enabled (due to the isolation level chosen for the change). To make the cherry-pick approach work, we would need to write that additional information into table metadata and build operations that can use it. We did this for dynamic partition overwrite because it was just a flag, but I'm concerned that it would be a lot of work to do this for all of the operations.\r\n\r\nFor the `PendingUpdate` approach, each operation is fully configured and kept around, so we can simply call `commit` again to re-apply the changes in the transaction.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, maybe the way I'm thinking about this is wrong because I'm assuming that we would want to apply the same validations (i.e., no files that might match `id = 5` have been added). Maybe for multi-table transactions we only want to validate that since the starting snapshot, no data changes have been made to a table for any table that is read. That would ensure correctness, and then we could simply check that the file changes can still be applied. This would make sense because we need to add the extra validations about other table states. As long as those are coarse validations based on only snapshot ID, then maybe it is okay that the commit changes are as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/736916300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/736939858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1747#issuecomment-736939858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1747","id":736939858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjkzOTg1OA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-02T02:07:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T02:07:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

To be fair though the current impl doesn't parse confusing timestamps well. I think the correct impl would be to parse both commit time and passed timestamps into `ZonedDateTime` then write as String in ISO format. Comparing those with prefix matching would then make sense. However I think that may be overkill at this time as the round up mechanism in this PR will satisfy the vast majority of use cases.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737200894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737203436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1825#issuecomment-737203436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1825","id":737203436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzIwMzQzNg==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-02T12:36:27Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T12:36:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n> By the way, what time zone are these supposed to be in?

I like that and it simplifies some of the logic in this PR. If I understand correctly in the case of stored procedures or other places where we have control we can use `PathIdentifier` or use the other mechanisms available to pass path information. Correct?\r\n\r\nWhat I am unsure about is how to handle path based `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER` comamands. We don't have much control over the `Identifier` and we would still have to inspect if its a path. Unless we do a `CREAT TABLE x AS iceberg LOCATION path`, which works but the table name is redundant/ignored.  Or are you suggesting this PR doesn't handle path based DDL coming from Spark?\r\n\r\nFWIW I agree that we shouldn't have a 'special' namespace for importing path based tables, however my approach of ignoring namespaces if the name is a path probably isn't quite right either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737233889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737244829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1860#issuecomment-737244829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1860","id":737244829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzI0NDgyOQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-02T13:55:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T13:55:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RussellSpitzer, this should unblock you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737244829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737253249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1852#issuecomment-737253249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1852","id":737253249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzI1MzI0OQ==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-02T14:10:37Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T14:10:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've merged this to unblock the Iceberg part.

I don't think using `LOCATION` keyword is an option for us, not because of the dummy table name, but because not all ALTER and DELETE statements support it natively in open source Spark.

Is that like rebasing another branch's changes onto the current? If not rebase, what would happen?\r\n\r\nThats correct, merge is probably closest to a fast forward rebase except history isn't re-written. If you had\r\n```\r\n C    E\r\n |    |\r\n B    D\r\n  \\   /\r\n    A\r\n```\r\nThen merging the right branch into the left would give:\r\n```\r\n E\r\n |\r\n D\r\n |\r\n C    E\r\n |    |\r\n B    D\r\n  \\   /\r\n    A\r\n```\r\nMerge always looks for a common ancestor and transplants commits across. It doesn't create a merge commit with multiple parents like git would. Nessie always keeps a linear history.\r\n\r\nIf there is no common ancestor or there is a conflict the operation would fail (atomically). Currently the failure report is simply 'merge failed'. There is work on the server in flight to make the failure more clear and actionable. Currently conflict is defined at the table level and for iceberg is simply: 'Table A on branch X has a different current snapshot than on branch Y'. It could be a really simple resolution (eg 2 appends) that could eventually be handled silently or something more complicated: conditional delete and schema change which drops a column from the conditional delete. Which would need more direct human intervention to resolve.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737864046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737912936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1849#issuecomment-737912936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1849","id":737912936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzkxMjkzNg==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-03T12:23:46Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T12:23:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am running behind on reviews right now so don't be blocked by me but I'd be glad to take a look next week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737912936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/737921384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1843#issuecomment-737921384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1843","id":737921384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNzkyMTM4NA==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-03T12:30:54Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T12:30:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @jackye1995 thanks for the comments! The first approach in this patch was trying to tackle the problem with a new catalog. You can see it [here](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1843/commits/9cf2bede01a9194e730f78888914bd9c6570aee3). On the plus side it keeps all the filesystem handling in 1 class but it does have the downside of creating a lot of duplicate code and wasn't super nice. @RussellSpitzer suggested the approach in this PR and I think I prefer it now too, it keeps the scope if this change very small too.\r\n\r\nWhat I am struggling w/ at the moment is:\r\n* how to robustly identify a path in an `Identifier` (eg not rely solely on the presence of `/`)\r\n* how to correctly handle edge cases like ```catalog.namespace.`file://path/to/table` ```.

Use `/` is probably not a too bad choice considering that people won't normally put `/` in the table name.

Is there a use case for relative path for Hadoop tables?\r\n\r\nAnd with whatever way we go for the check, I think it should be somewhere in the core package, instead of a protected method `isHadoopTable`, so that it can be used across compute engines for consistent behavior.

There isn't a need to address how to embed path-based tables in SQL commands right now. However we choose to do that would probably be a different solution. Right now, we need to unblock multicatalog support in `IcebergSource` by having a way to pass the path through as a table identifier, and the `PathIdentifier` option works well for that.\r\n\r\nFor the larger question about `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc., I think the short-term solution is to define a HadoopCatalog that can handle those SQL commands.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, I've advocated that Spark should have some way of identifying and passing path identifiers to plugins. The problem here is that no one seems to know what the behavior or path-based tables in SQL is or should be. But I think that a similar `PathIdentifier` approach would work once that is addressed in the upstream community.\r\n\r\nLast, if we want to support identifiers with a catalog and a quoted path, we can do that any time by choosing when to interpret the catalog name as a quoted path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/739012585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/739013885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1843#issuecomment-739013885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1843","id":739013885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTAxMzg4NQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-04T20:52:30Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T20:52:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Delta allows absolute paths only . . .\r\n\r\nConsidering the behavior for SQL is undefined, I would rather not add support for this right away.

Thanks!\r\n\r\nOne thing I wonder is how much it is helpful or even it hurts to have table property for this, as we are in consensus that this might be dangerous on batch query if they don't notice the behavior (depending on cardinality of partitions). I also commented on previous PR and it got merged without answering it. For now we don't explain what is fanout writer in the doc, so they have no idea and fear to enable this, but once we document the behavior without proper warn, they may be misunderstanding the behavior as good for all cases and update the table property. (I guess you're concerning about documenting this due to this, do I understand correctly?)\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm not 100% sure we'd like to add table property which is only good for specific workload, but at least we could document this with warning that this opens files for cardinality of partitions in the data in each task, so only recommended to use it in streaming write (not mentioning table property here).
