These over-arching concerns came up (partly alluded to earlier by you):</p>\n\n<p>1. Currently INotify is restricted to HDFS admins because it doesn't scale (wrt namenode). So in its current state it seems unsuitable for Hdfs Spout kind of use case... even if we (unrealistically) asked users to run Storm worker as a HDFS admin user.<br/>\n2. The proposal for scaling Inotify and opening it up to end users appears to have stalled for some time now. </p>\n\n<p>Although we are seeing some improvements (that you noted) in resource utilization from the Storm side, it seems not advisable from the HDFS namenode perspective. I think this feature in HDFS Spout would be useful once a scaleable inotify solution is made publicly available by HDFS.</p>\n\n<p>The other option is to get this into Storm now and not use it till HDFS implements their scaleable inotify. My concern with that is we cant bet with certainty that final inotify will still work as we now expect it to (although the intent is there) ... it may even change in a incompatible way. </p>\n\n<p>Either way it appears like a feature that cant be used until the scaleable inotify happens (if it happens).</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287241804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2014#issuecomment-287241804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2014","id":287241804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzI0MTgwNA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T01:30:24Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T01:30:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287241804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287241820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2015#issuecomment-287241820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2015","id":287241820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzI0MTgyMA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T01:30:28Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T01:30:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287241820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287267023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2007#issuecomment-287267023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2007","id":287267023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzI2NzAyMw==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T04:57:09Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T04:57:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

The ackers can be scaled out to handle a large number of acks, and can then notify the spout of acks only once per tuple tree. I'm assuming we want to keep the management of tuple tree ack/fail inside the spout( ? ), so have you considered a way to deduplicate or \"bundle up\" the ack stream in the acker before notifying the spout that the timeout should be reset? Maybe only notify once a percentage of the timeout has elapsed?</p>\n\n<p>The bolt heartbeating may be able to reuse some code from <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1549\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1549</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287588059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2019#issuecomment-287588059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2019","id":287588059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzU4ODA1OQ==","user":{"login":"satishd","id":2577761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd","html_url":"https://github.com/satishd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-19T01:46:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T01:46:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, LGTM. \r\n\r\n@roshannaik You may want to address those minor nits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287588059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/287590361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2019#issuecomment-287590361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2019","id":287590361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzU5MDM2MQ==","user":{"login":"roshannaik","id":2366541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjY1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2366541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik","html_url":"https://github.com/roshannaik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-19T02:51:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-19T02:51:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @satishd for the quick turnaround.
