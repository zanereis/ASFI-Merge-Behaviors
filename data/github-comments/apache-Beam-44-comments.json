For now I've changed it to `withCoder(Coder<? super T> coder)`, or alternatively, we could remove `withCoder` from `Bound` altogether, and force users to call `withCoder` on `TextIO.Read` or `TextIO.Write` directly.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/245078405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/245086848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/918#issuecomment-245086848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/918","id":245086848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTA4Njg0OA==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T20:50:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T20:50:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Now that I think about this more, do we expect users to have headers and footers which are always of type T, it seems as though your original suggestion to use strings was the correct one.
