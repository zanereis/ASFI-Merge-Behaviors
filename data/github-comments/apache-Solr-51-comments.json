made some good progress here:\r\n1. The generated JS client is is produced via the `solr:api:buildJSClient` task, and `assemblePackaging` now copies the generated JS files into a sub-dir of the webapp's `libs/` directory.  So the Admin UI _should_ be able to access it, if it can find the right way to import it (see below)\r\n2. I've picked \"Delete Collection\" as a good example for dogfooding the new client.  (I chose this mostly because it's a simple API call that the Admin UI only makes in a single place). The latest commit swaps in some code to delete collections using our new client, and it looks very manageable.\r\n\r\nBut....\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to actually test this because **I can't figure out how to correctly import the library/module**. 😬   I've added a script tag (`<script type=\"module\" src=\"libs/solr/index.js\"></script>`) to `solr/webapp/web/index.html`, which seems like it finds the generated JS code.  But loading the main page of the Admin UI triggers a long run of import errors in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)        ApiClient:1\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found).       BackupDeletionData:1\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)        AddReplicaPropertyRequestBody:1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like these errors correspond to imports near the top of `libs/solr/index.js`.  One thing that jumps out at me in those errors is that it looks like we're importing the right filenames/paths, but with the file-extension missing entirely.  Not sure what to make of that, but figured it might ring a bell for someone with more JS experience.\r\n\r\nPossibly related, the README produced with the generated client includes some instructions on building and publishing the JS code as an NPM package.  We don't run a Node server or use npm in the Admin UI as far as I can tell, so I was hoping that we could avoid any sort of \"packaging\", beyond copying the JS files into the webapp's `lib/` directory as I've done.  But maybe that's the root of the problems above in some way: that we're generating Node-flavored JS code and then trying to run it like vanilla JS code.  I'm not even sure if that makes sense; clearly I'm very out of my depth here 😛  \r\n\r\nWould love some help from anyone more familiar with JS (and maybe Node) development.  Maybe @janhoy or @MarcusSorealheis if either of you get a few minutes?  We're so close to getting this in, I hate to see this blocked so near to the finish line.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1804329062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1805419156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2070#issuecomment-1805419156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2070","id":1805419156,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5rnIKU","user":{"login":"cpoerschke","id":6458642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6458642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke","html_url":"https://github.com/cpoerschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpoerschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-10T09:51:43Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T09:51:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Do we want to add CHANGES and refguide docs (separate PR) into this backport and squash it, or is it more transparent to do two commits for the backport too?\r\n\r\nI would favour separate commits i.e. one `main` commit maps to one (or zero) `branch_9x` commits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1805419156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1806789831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2030#issuecomment-1806789831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2030","id":1806789831,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5rsWzH","user":{"login":"babesflorin","id":1515563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTU1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1515563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin","html_url":"https://github.com/babesflorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babesflorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-11T11:25:45Z","updated_at":"2023-11-11T11:25:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @cpoerschke.

great news: with a good deal of help from @HoustonPutman I've been able to resolve the packaging/import issues mentioned in my last comment.\r\n\r\nDespite its name, it looks like the 'javascript' generator produces JS code that relies on a few server-side-NodeJS features (e.g. using `require` for module resolution/importing).  It should really be named 'nodejs'.

So this PR now adds code to our gradle build for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we eventually publish this JS client we'll need to decide whether to publish in NodeJS/npm-ready or the browserify-bundled form.

As it stands today, folks that come in expecting a full querying/indexing client **are** going to be disappointed unless we convey the limitations more clearly than we do currently.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nA small general update on this:\r\n\r\nWith the JS client PR (#2050) merged, I've got more time and attention to hopefully move this forward.  My first step is to find a way to dogfood the client, ideally in Python code we already have.  We have a surprising number of small Python scripts in our codebase (see below), if any of these are making Admin APIs calls they might be a good place to get some dog-fooding in.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ find . -name \"*.py\" | grep -v nodejs | grep -v build\r\n./solr/example/films/vectors/create_dataset.py\r\n./solr/example/films/vectors/films.py\r\n./solr/example/films/vectors/create_model.py\r\n./solr/modules/ltr/example/libsvm_formatter.py\r\n./solr/modules/ltr/example/train_and_upload_demo_model.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/githubPRs.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/smokeTestRelease.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/refguide/gen-refguide-redirects.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/addVersion.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/scriptutil.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/scaffoldNewModule.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/releasedJirasRegex.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/releaseWizard.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/addDepsToChanges.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/checkJavadocLinks.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/reproduceJenkinsFailures.py\r\n./dev-tools/scripts/create_line_file_docs.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe files look like a mix of scripts for developers, and scripts that actually ship with Solr for examples and other purposes. \r\n Adding dogfooding to the development scripts would require script-users to call `./gradlew` to generate the Python client prior to running the script.  That's a bit of a burden, but maybe it'd be reasonable given the intended audience. \r\n \r\nAdding the Python client to the various scripts used in Solr's \"examples\" seems trickier since these ship with Solr.  The Python client library would have to be included in the Solr tgz in some way.  But maybe there's prior-art for this if the 'example' scripts rely on any 3rd-party libraries already?\r\n\r\nAnyone have thoughts/suggestions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1810571548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1810651483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2052#issuecomment-1810651483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2052","id":1810651483,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5r7Flb","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-14T16:39:46Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T16:39:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Is the \"startJettySolrRunner\" method actually used?

The \"approximation\" in this PR falls pretty far short of what the Admin UI exposes.\r\n\r\nIf we cared to, we could close a lot of that gap with very little effort.  Most parameters would be trivial to add.  But there's a few sticking points that are going to require a good bit more effort I think: in particular the arbitrary query-params that /select supports as placeholders/variables, and the JSON DSL.\r\n\r\nThat's one of the reasons I didn't go beyond the absolute basics in this PR - I wanted the approximation to be driven by actual dogfood-able usage, and the Admin UI query screen felt out of reach for an initial pass.\r\n\r\n> However, for the V2 Query syntax, is that actually simpler from a API perspective since it's mostly \"generate a lot of JSON and pass it to this end point\"?

For the approximation, we could definitely have a POST that takes an arbitrary map in the request body (without trying to dictate exactly what properties/fields are in that map).  I'll add that and see how it looks.\r\n\r\nI've been assuming I guess that we'll eventually want something more DSL-syntax aware, but given Jan's point above, maybe that's not even true.  Maybe the \"approximate\" solution is the best one here for clients, even in the long term.  Users might just prefer to specify a \"raw\" String rather than finding whatever obscure qparser model class they would otherwise need.  And you could imagine an approximate solution might be more flexible for supporting user's server-side plugins, etc.  I'm not sure one way or another, but it's definitely worth thinking through...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1814728136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1814899779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2079#issuecomment-1814899779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2079","id":1814899779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5sLSxD","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-16T17:22:10Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T17:22:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Definitly referring to the JSON DSL.

The trick I think is going to be supporting that without precluding something more structured.  AFAIK, without customizing the template at all, we can only have 1 client method per HTTP endpoint, since the clients are generated from an OAS and specs can't contain multiple entries for the same path/verb combo.  Maybe the OAS just needs to be incredibly generic, and the client templates will handle things correctly whether users pass in a map, string, etc?
