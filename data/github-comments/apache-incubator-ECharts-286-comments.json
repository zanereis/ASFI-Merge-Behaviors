I mean that you have to calculate that margin depending on labels font size and width. According to me it would be better to be able to align to left starting from the left of the graph area. Margin could be use but only to add some custom space. Currently if you work with dynamic values you just can't use that feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/625156511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/625160137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12583#issuecomment-625160137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12583","id":625160137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTE2MDEzNw==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T10:09:04Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T10:09:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is not created using [issue template](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-issue-helper/) so I'm going to close it. 🙊\nSorry for this, but it helps save our maintainers' time so that more developers get helped.\nFeel free to create another issue using the issue template.\n\nIf you think you have already made your point clear without the template, or your problem cannot be covered by it, you may re-open this issue again.\n\n这个 issue 未使用 [issue 模板](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-issue-helper/?lang=zh-cn) 创建，所以我将关闭此 issue。\n为此带来的麻烦我深表歉意，但是请理解这是为了节约社区维护者的时间，以更高效地服务社区的开发者群体。\n如果您愿意，可以请使用 issue 模板重新创建 issue。\n\n如果你认为虽然没有使用模板，但你已经提供了复现问题的充分描述，或者你的问题无法使用模板表达，也可以重新 open 这个 issue。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/625160137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/625170597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/8306#issuecomment-625170597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/8306","id":625170597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTE3MDU5Nw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T10:30:40Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T10:30:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
