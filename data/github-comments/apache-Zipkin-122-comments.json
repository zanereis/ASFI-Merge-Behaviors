So, I am guessing that you are talking about something like.. strange_tag here\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"traceId\": \"4d1e00c0db9010db86154a4ba6e91385\",\r\n  \"parentId\": \"86154a4ba6e91385\",\r\n  \"id\": \"4d1e00c0db9010db\",\r\n  \"kind\": \"CLIENT\",\r\n  \"name\": \"get\",\r\n  \"timestamp\": 1472470996199000,\r\n  \"duration\": 207000,\r\n  \"tags\": {\r\n    \"http.path\": \"/api\",\r\n    \"strange_tag\": {\"nested\": \"true\"}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I think if we did this what would end up happening is that because the indexing is custom, (`\"tags\": {\"enabled\": false }` in our index template, search might not be broken. However, since it is permitting broken values when our normal API doesn't allow it, other things might break. For example, our normal json codec should break on an invalid value.\r\n\r\nIf we do this for Elasticsearch, this does not mean we will do it for our default parser, because it is definitely not conformant data, and people should know that their data is invalid for zipkin. So, I want to set this expectation before we proceed.\r\n\r\nIf we do have this, not only does it need to be unit tested, but also added as an integration test to make sure it actually works. So, in `ITElasticsearchStorage` add a tests like..\r\n\r\n* ITTraces.getTrace_skipsInvalidTagValue\r\n  * lookup of trace by ID that includes a non-string value doesn't break returning it.\r\n* ITSpanStore.getTraces_skipsInvalidTagValue\r\n  * the search key in the query has one trace that matches the correct value and other has a non-string value doesn't break it.\r\n* ITDependencies.getDependencies_linksSkipsInvalidTagValue\r\n  * a trace that is linked based on span kind has a non-string value, and it doesn't break linking\r\n  * This may also break zipkin-dependencies the separate project\r\n* ITAutocompleteTags.skipsInvalidTagValue\r\n  * autocomplete key is set to a trace which has a non-string value, and is ignored.\r\n\r\nIf any of the above don't work, we shouldn't land this, as it is already very difficult to support ES with template defined for our correct data format. Even if we do land this, it won't be a precedent for changing our core parser which correctly breaks if a tag has a non-string value.\r\n\r\nThis means we need in the PR a zipkin-storage/elasticsearch/RATIONALE.md for why we are doing this, knowing the index is for zipkin data and this is invalid. This rational should be strong but will not change our default parser, as permitting schema change in something we define as stable is a step backwards not forwards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1894350504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1894529398","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3503#issuecomment-1894529398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3503","id":1894529398,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc5w7Dl2","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-16T21:19:24Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T21:19:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ps I will help with the test backfill on current code, as I think it will lead to resolving this one way or another more easy.
